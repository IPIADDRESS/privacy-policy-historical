								<div class="ppTitle">Viber Privacy Policy</div>
								<p>(Last updated on January 23, 2011)</p>
								<p>Viber Media, Inc. ("Viber" or "we" or "us" or "our" or other similar pronouns) takes your privacy very seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy ("Policy"). This Policy details how we receive, collect and use information in connection with our website located at Viber.com (the "Site"), the Viber VoIP software ("Viber App"), and other products and services provided on the Viber.com website (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Services").</p>
								<br>
								<div class="ppSubTitle">1. Collection and Use of Information</div>
								<p></p>
								<div class="ppSubTopic">Viber Application</div>
								<p>When you install the Viber App and register on the Site, you will be asked to provide your phone number and to allow us access to your iPhone or Android address book (collectively, "Personal Information"). A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other personal information in your address book) will be stored on our servers and will only be used to:</p>
								<p>(a) notify you when your contacts become active on Viber,  </p>
								<p>(b) indicate which of your contacts are already Viber users, </p>
								<p>(c) correctly display the name of each contact as it appears in your address book when a call is received.</p>
								<p>In addition, we may also create a function in the future to use this data to synchronize your address book across your multiple devices.</p>
								<p>The copy of your address book (names and phones) is stored on a live database. This database does not have a "historical backup". If you delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), it will be deleted instantly and permanently.</p>
								<p>Your phone number, which will be verified via text message to you, will be used for identification purposes as your Viber user ID.</p>
								<p>Viber also maintains a Call Detail Record  (CDR - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record</a>) for each call conducted on the system.  These are industry standard records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in order to better understand network behavior and trends (numbers of calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support request. We maintain CDRs for a period of no more than 30 months.</p>
								<p>Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for example, firewalls), Viber servers are used to transmit the call.  In the latter scenario, the information transmitted is stored briefly in volatile memory (RAM) solely to enable the transmission of the call to the other user.  WE DO NOT RECORD ANY PART OF YOUR CALL.</p>
								<div class="ppSubTopic">Other Services</div>
								<p>In the event we make message boards and forums available to you (collectively, "Forums"), you will be solely responsible for the information and other content you post on and through these Forums and should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., name, e-mail address, telephone number) on or through these Forums, such information is generally accessible to, and may be collected and used by, other users. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, and such messages are beyond our control. We do not exercise control over any users or Site visitors, and in no way are we responsible, and have any liability whatsoever, for any collection or use of information you may disclose through the Forums. This Policy does not cover such disclosure of information. You are encouraged to exercise discretion when providing personal information about yourself in and through Forums. Please do not post any personal information on this Site that you expect to keep private.</p>
								<div class="ppSubTopic">Cookies, Clear GIFs and Other Automatically Collected Data</div>
								<p>If you have permitted your computer to accept cookies, we may use cookies on the Site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at the Site. Cookies may be used to analyze the Site usage, improve content, customize the Site's content and layout and for other customer service purposes. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Site to other information about you, including your Personal Information.  All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Site.   Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.  Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies.  However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or certain areas or features of the Site.</p>
								<p>We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to evaluate Site usage information about visitors to the Site, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information, and know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message.  A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.  A clear gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</p>
								<p>Our servers may automatically collect data about your Internet address when you visit us.  This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet.  When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and, if applicable, your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our members and users as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information.  Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Site; the web site you visit after this Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our servers.  We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Services.  Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.</p>
								<p>We will not link any Personal Information, including e-mail addresses, with aggregate data of our users.</p>
								<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers, including, for example, our analytics vendor(s) and our e-mail management partner(s).</p>
								<div class="ppSubTopic">Third-Party Sites and Privacy Practices</div>
								<p>You may arrive at our Site and/or download the Viber App from another website.  In addition, our Site may contain links that will let you leave our Site and access another website.  Websites linked to or from our Site are not under the control of Viber and it is possible that these websites have a different privacy policy.  Our Policy applies solely to Personal Information that is acquired on the Site or through your use of our Services, and/or your relationship with Viber.  We urge you to be careful when you enter any personal information online.  We accept no responsibility or liability for these other websites.</p>
								<br>
								<div class="ppSubTitle">2. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</div>
								<p>We do not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe such action is necessary to:</p>
								<p>(a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us; </p>
								<p>(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or</p>
								<p>(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our services or members of the public.</p>
								<p>In order to provide you with Viber products you have requested, Viber may sometimes, if necessary, share your Personal Information (excluding your address book and related information) and traffic data with trusted partner service providers and/or agents. For example, banking organizations or other providers of payment and analytical services, customer support, or hosting services. Viber will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. Viber will never share your address book information with any third party, except as may be required by law (see below).</p>
								<p>The following is a description of how we may share your Personal Information with trusted third party partners.  Should we add additional partners, we will immediately update this description:</p>
								<p>1. We use three separate third party companies in order to send you an authentication SMS when you register with Viber. In order to send you the SMS, we send one of these third party companies your phone number and the authentication message. These third parties are contractually obligated to only use your phone number for the transmission of the authentication SMS.</p>
								<p>2. If we fail to send you an SMS (this happens in certain cases) you may ask us to call you and read you the authentication code on the phone. This is done using a third party automated phone system.  In order to call you, we provide this third party partner with your phone number and send the "audio content" of the call to them. The third party partner in turn will typically use another phone provider who may use another phone provider and so on until the call reaches you. This is an industry standard mechanism for the transmission of phone calls. The third party partner is contractually obligated to only use your phone number for the completion of the authentication phone call.</p>
								<p>3. We may use Apple's Push Notification Service to notify you about phone calls. If we do, the phone number or the name of the person calling you may be part of the message. This message is sent to Apple Inc., for delivery to your iPhone.</p>
								<p>Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Viber servers that are used to store your Personal Information are owned and hosted by Amazon Web Services, LLC, an Amazon.com Company. You can read more about measures taken by Amazon to protect the security of their servers and your Personal Information here:</p>
								<p><a href="http://awsmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">http://awsmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf</a></p>
								<p>We may disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance that disclosure of information is necessary.</p>
								<p>We may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences which will be used to measure and improve quality.  You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data.  Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback forms on the Site or any survey that you accept to take part in is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the Viber software, products and websites.</p>
								<p>We may contact you to send you messages about faults and service issues.  Further, we reserve the right to use email, the Viber software or SMS to notify you of any eventual claims related to your use of our software, websites and/or products, including without limitation claims of violation of third party rights.</p>
								<p>We may send you alerts via the Viber software to notify you when someone has tried to contact you.  We may also use the Viber software to keep you up to date with news about our software and products that you have purchased and/or to inform you about other Viber products and related information.</p>
								<br>
								<div class="ppSubTitle">3. Children's Privacy</div>
								<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. We operate our Site in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We never knowingly, directly or indirectly, collect or maintain Personal Information at or on our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is directed at or structured to attract anyone under 13. Visitors younger than 13 years of age may NOT use the Services (including the Viber App) and must LEAVE immediately.</p>
								<br>
								<div class="ppSubTitle">4. Security</div>
								<p>We take reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although we cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, we have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the Personal Information. Personal Information is stored on our servers and protected by secured networks to which access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
								<br>
								<div class="ppSubTitle">5. Business Transitions</div>
								<p>In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. As part of such a transaction the new entity will be required to commit to the same level of protection of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cannot obtain such a commitment, we will not perform the business transition.</p>
								<p>We will post a notice on this Site of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information we may have prior to such transfer.</p>
								<br>
								<div class="ppSubTitle">6. Changes to Policy</div>
								<p>From time to time, we may revise this Policy. We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any time with or without notice.  We will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information we collect, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed.  You agree to review the Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications.  Your continued use of the Site indicates your assent to any changes and signifies your agreement to the terms of our Policy.  If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Site, the Viber App, or any of the other Services.</p>
								<br>
								<div class="ppSubTitle">7. Change or Removal of Information</div>
								<p>If you provided your e-mail address to us and wish to update it, you may do so by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@viber.com">support@viber.com</a></p>
								<p>If you no longer wish to receive e-mail communication from us, such as offers, updates and newsletters, you may opt-out of receiving such communications by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication. In addition, you can remove your e-mail address at any time by sending an e-mail with the subject line of UNSUBSCRIBE to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@viber.com">unsubscribe@viber.com</a></p>
								<p>Due to technological reasons, we do not know when and if you delete the application. Therefore, if we detect no activity from your device for 45 days, we will assume that you deleted the application and we will remove your address book from our servers. However, since we are not certain that you deleted the application (you may just be on vacation, etc.) we will not deactivate your Viber account (which is your phone number and device ID). We do not want to force you to register again in the event of non-use.</p>
								<p>If you wish to delete your account completely, you should contact Viber via "Viber Support" (available at Viber.com) and request that your account be deleted. Viber 2.0, expected in Q1 2011, will offer an instant deactivation option.</p>
								<br>
								<div class="ppSubTitle">8. Contact Information</div>
								<p>Please direct all questions in connection with this Policy via e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@viber.com">privacy@viber.com</a> or by writing to Viber Media, Inc., Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, 40 Kimonos St.3095 Limassol, Cyprus.</p>
