      This Privacy Policy describes how Viewbook, B.V. ("Viewbook," "we," "our" or "us")
      collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our websites (including www.viewbook.com), services,
      and applications (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") does
      not apply to information our customers may process when using our Services.
      <br>
      <br> We may collect and receive information about users of our Services ("users," "you," or "your")
      from various sources, including: (i) information you provide through your user account on the Services (your "Account")
      if you register for the Services; (ii) your use of the Services; and (iii) from third-party websites, services, and
      partners.
      <br>
      <br> If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or Viewbook's data collection, use, and disclosure practices,
      please contact us at support@viewbook.com.
      <br>
      <br> In our Privacy Policy, when we refer to “Users”, we mean our customers who use our Services, including
      visitors to our sites. The users, visitors and customers of, our Users’ sites are “End Users”.
      <br>
      <br> This Privacy Policy describes what we do with personal information that we collect and use for our own purposes, such
      as your account information and information about how you use and interact with our Services, including information
      you submit to our customer support as well as certain information relating to your End Users.
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        1. Information we collect
      </h3>

      <p>
        We collect various personal information regarding you or your device. This includes the following:
          <br>
          <br> Information you provide to create an Account, specifically email address, first name and last name. If you sign
          up for Paid Services, we receive a portion of your payment information from our payment processor (such as the
          last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date of the payment card) and we ask you to select
          your jurisdiction.
          <br>
          <br> The emails and other communications that you send us or otherwise contribute, such as customer support inquiries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Information from your use of the Services or Users’ sites. This includes: IP addresses, preferences, web pages
          you visited prior to coming to our or our Users’ sites, information about your browser, network or device
          (such as browser type and version, operating system, internet service provider, preference settings, unique device
          IDs and language and other regional settings), information about how you interact with the Services and our Users’
          sites (such as timestamps, clicks, scrolling, browsing times, searches, transactions, referral pages, load times,
          and problems you may encounter, such as loading errors).
      </p>

      <h3>
        2. How we collect personal information
      </h3>

      <p>
        a. Personal information you provide
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Account registration
              <br> When you register for an Account, we may ask for your contact information, including items such as name, company
              name, address, email address, and telephone number.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Payment Information.
              <br> When you add your financial account information to your Account, that information is directed to our third-party
              payment processor. We do not store your financial account information on our systems; however, we have access
              to, and may retain, subscriber information through our third-party payment processor.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            
          Communications.
              <br> If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address,
              the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to
              provide. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            User Content.
              <br> Our web publishing services allow you to publicly post content on our Services. You agree that your 
              information and the content you post may be viewed and used by other users and third parties we do not control.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Sometimes we require you to provide us with information for contractual or legal reasons. For example, we may ask
          you to select your jurisdiction when you sign up for Paid Services to determine if, and how much, tax we need to
          collect from you. We’ll normally let you know when information is required, and the consequences of failing
          to provide it. If you do not provide personal information when requested.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>
        b. Personal information obtained from your use of our Services
          <br>
          <br> When you use our Services, we collect information about your activity on and interaction with the Services, such
          as your IP address(es), your device and browser type, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, what
          pages on our sites you visit and for how long and identifiers associated with your devices.
          <br>
      </p>

      <p>
      <br> c. Personal information obtained from other sources
      </p>

      <p>
        If you use a Third Party Service (such as Facebook) to register for an Account, the Third Party Service may provide
          us with your Third Party Service account information on your behalf, such as your name and email address (we don’t
          store passwords you use to access Third Party Services). Your privacy settings on the Third Party Service normally
          control what they share with us. Make sure you are comfortable with what they share by reviewing their privacy
          policies and, if necessary, modifying your privacy settings directly on the Third Party Service.
          <br>
          <br> If you sign up for Paid Services, we obtain limited information about your payment card from our payment processor,
          such as the last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date. Currently, our payment processor
          is Chargify. Chargify uses and processes your complete payment information in accordance with Chargify’s
          privacy policy. <a href="https://www.chargify.com/legal/">https://www.chargify.com/legal/</a>

      </p>

      <h3>
        4. How we share your personal information
      </h3>

      <p>
        We share personal information in the following ways:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Vendors and Service Providers. We may share information with third-party vendors and service providers that provide

        <li>
          <p>
            Analytics. We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect non-identifying
              information. Google provides some additional privacy options regarding its Analytics cookies at
              <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Process payments. We transmit your personal information via an encrypted connection to our payment processor
              Chargify. See
              <a href="https://www.chargify.com/legal/">https://www.chargify.com/legal/</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Following the law or protecting rights and interests. We disclose your personal information if we determine that
              such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, protect our or others’ rights, property
              or interests (such as enforcing our Terms of Service) or prevent fraud or abuse of Viewbook or our Users or
              End Users. In particular, we may disclose your personal information in response to lawful requests by public
              authorities, such as to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
            
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>
        5. Security
      </h3>

      <p>
        Viewbook is committed to protecting your information. To do so, we employ a variety of security technologies and
          measures designed to protect information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The measures we use are
          designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However,
          please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
      </p>

      

      <h3>
        6. Data Retention
      </h3>

      <p>
        We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for
          example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting
          requirements).
        
      </p>

      

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize
          it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives),
          then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
          is possible.
      </p>

      

      <p>
        As Users may have a seasonal site or come back to us after an Account becomes inactive, we don’t immediately
          delete your personal information when your trial expires or you cancel all Paid Services. Instead, we keep your
          personal information for a reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you come back.
      </p>

      

      <p>
        You may delete your Account by contacting us at support@viewbook.com and Viewbook will delete the personal information
          it holds about you (unless we need to retain it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy).
      </p>

      

      <h3>
        7. Access
      </h3>

      <p>
        If you are a registered user, you may access certain information associated with your Account by logging into our
          Services or emailing support@viewbook.com. If you terminate your Account, any public activity on your Account prior
          to deletion may remain stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public. 
      </p>

      

      <p>
        To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or
          removing your information. The information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us according
          to backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to
          access and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could: inhibit Viewbook's
          ability to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit Viewbook's ability to investigate, make or defend legal
          claims; result in disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in breach of a contract or
          disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to Viewbook or a third party.
      </p>

      <h3>
        8. Your data protection rights under the general data protection regulation (gdpr)
      </h3>

      <p>
        If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you wish to access, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any
              time by emailing support@viewook.com.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing
              of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise
              these rights by emailing support@viewook.com.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right
              by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails we send you.
              To opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us by emailing support@viewbook.com.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw
              your consent at any time. &nbsp;Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we
              conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted
              in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.
              For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

          by decision, offers an adequate level of data protection, pursuant to an approved certification mechanism or code
          of conduct, together with binding enforcement commitments from the recipient to apply the appropriate safeguards,
          including as regards data subjects’ rights, or to processors which have committed to comply with binding
          corporate rules.
