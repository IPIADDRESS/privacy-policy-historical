				<h2>Viewbook Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>Last Updated: March 16th, 2008</p>

				<p>Privacy is important. This policy applies to all Viewbook websites, products, services, and content offered by Viewbook <span class="caps">LLC</span> (“Viewbook”) including by not limited to Viewbook (www.viewbook.com).</p>

				<p>Viewbook reserves the right to update and change this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to this Privacy Policy. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. </p>

				<p><strong>Information we collect and how we use it</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Information you provide – Viewbook collects personal information (e.g. name, email, and passwords) when you register for an Viewbook service or otherwise voluntarily provide such information. For certain services, we may also request credit card and billing information. We may combine personal information from you from other Viewbook services to provide a better experience.</li>

				<p>Viewbook uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and service provisioning, billing, identification and authentication, service improvement, contact, and research.</p>

				<p><strong>Dislosure</strong></p>
				<p>Viewbook may disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas, or when your actions violate the Terms of service.</p>
				<p>It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including, without limitation: fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.</p>
				<p>We may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties.</p>
				<p>If Viewbook becomes involved in a merger or acquisition, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>You may decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some of our features or services may not function properly as a result.</li>
