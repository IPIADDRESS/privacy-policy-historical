<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<div align="left" style="padding: 10px;">

    
<p>This privacy
policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes the personal information
collected about users of the online game service accessible via the Website
located at vietson.com and related URLs (the "Service") and how
such information may be used or disclosed by vietson.com. ("Vietson").</p>

<p>The term
"You" (and its variants) refers to You as a user of the Service and the term
"Us" (and its variants) refers to Vietson.&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>As part of
the operation of the Service We collect and may disclose information about You.
By accepting the vietson.com Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, You consent
to Our use and disclosure of Your personal information as described in this
Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the
terms of the vietson.com Terms of Use.</p>

<h4>A Special Note About Children</h4>

<p>Please note
that individuals under the age of 18 may not submit any personal information to
Us or otherwise use the Service. </p>

<h4>Information We Collect</h4>

<p class="MsoNormal">We
use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the
Service. "Cookies" are small files placed on Your hard drive that
assist Us in providing customized services. Certain features of the Service are
only available with the use of a "cookie." We use this information to
determine Our members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better
understand and serve You and other members. This information may include the
URL of the website that You visited prior to the Service (whether this URL is
on the Service or not), the URL of the website You next go to (whether this URL
is on the Service or not), what browser You are using and Your Internet
Protocol address. Most cookies are "session cookies" meaning that
they are automatically deleted from Your hard drive at the end of a session.
You are always free not to accept cookies if Your browser permits. </p>

<p>We may use a
third party advertising company to serve ads on Our behalf across the Internet.
That advertising company may also collect anonymous information about Your
visits to the Service. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a
technology device, commonly referred to as a Web beacon, cookie or an action
tag, which is placed on various Web pages within the Service or in an HTML
e-mail that allows the third party advertising company to collect anonymous
information. There may also be a number of services offered by external service
providers that help You use the Service. If You choose to use these optional
services and in doing so disclose information to the external service providers
or grant them permission to collect information about You, then their use of
Your information will be governed by their private policies, if any.</p>

<h4>How We Use Personal Information</h4>

<p>We use
information in the data files We maintain about You, and the other information
We obtain from Your current and past activities on the Service to resolve
disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce Our Terms of Use. We may review the
data of multiple members to identify problems or resolve disputes.</p>

<p>We may use
personally identifiable information, data files and other information about You
including but not limited to images, video recordings, and audio recordings to
improve Our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze usage of the Service,
improve Our content and product offerings, and customize the Service content,
layout, and features. </p>

<p>We may use
Your information to contact You and to deliver information to You that may be
targeted to Your interests, such as banner advertisements, administrative
notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to Your use of the
Service. You agree to receive this information. If You do not wish to receive
this information, You may opt out of the receipt of certain communications. To
learn how to do so please go to the "Help" section of the Service. </p>

<h4>Email Policies</h4>

<p>By default,
we will send you weekly updates of various site information, a variety of
transactional emails such as when users send you a message and the occasional
site announcement. </p>



<h4>Inviting Friends</h4>

<p>Inviting
friends to vietson.com is always completely optional. When you choose to invite
friends, we will send an email to the addresses you enter indicating that it is
a message from you. We will share your name and email address with anyone you
invite so that they know who the invitation is coming from. If a friend does
not respond to the initial invitation after a little while, we will send up to
one reminder messages on your behalf. </p>

<p>For your
convenience, vietson.com offers the ability to import email addresses from
common address books such as Hotmail/Yahoo/<span class="SpellE">Gmail</span>/AOL.
If you choose to use this feature, we will access your address book using the
login details that you provide. We access your address book only once to
retrieve your friends' information so that you may select whom to invite. We do
not store your login details nor do we use them for any other purpose then to
retrieve your contacts. We never send invitations to contacts you do not
explicitly select and your invitations are the only email we will ever send to
your friends unless they register to join the site. </p>

<p>If you have
accidentally sent invitations you did not intend - please <a href="Contact.cfm">contact us</a> and we can cancel the reminder
message. </p>

<h4>Our Disclosure of Your
Information</h4>

<p>Although we
use industry-standard efforts to protect the personal information We collect
via the Service, we cannot guarantee that this information will not be accessed
by the government or third parties in certain circumstances. We may be required
by law to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or
third parties. &nbsp;In addition, third parties may unlawfully intercept or

companies may employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising
effectiveness. </p>

<p>We may
require that you submit certain financial information, including Your credit
card billing information. We will use this information to bill You for use of
Our Services and products. By making a purchase, or engaging in any other kind

data collected via the Service, including personally identifiable information
about You, with Our parent, affiliates, or subsidiaries. Our parent, affiliates

information with the merger partner or acquiring party. The acquiring entity or
newly combined entity will follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy
Policy with respect to such information. </p>

with law enforcement inquiries and with third parties to enforce laws. You

practices. We will notify you of such revisions and such revisions shall become
