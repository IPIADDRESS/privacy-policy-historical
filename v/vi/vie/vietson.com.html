<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<div align="left" style="padding: 10px;">

    
<p>This privacy
policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes the personal information
collected about users of the online game service accessible via the Website
located at www.VIETSON.com and related URLs (the "Service") and how
such information may be used or disclosed by VIETSON.com. ("VIETSON").</p>

<p>The term
"You" (and its variants) refers to You as a user of the Service and the term
"Us" (and its variants) refers to VIETSON.&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>As part of
the operation of the Service We collect and may disclose information about You.
By accepting the VIETSON.com Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, You consent
to Our use and disclosure of Your personal information as described in this
Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the
terms of the VIETSON.com Terms of Use.</p>

<h4>A Special Note About Children</h4>

<p>Please note
that individuals under the age of 18 may not submit any personal information to
Us or otherwise use the Service. </p>

<h4>Information We Collect</h4>

<p class="MsoNormal">We
use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the
Service. "Cookies" are small files placed on Your hard drive that
assist Us in providing customized services. Certain features of the Service are
only available with the use of a "cookie." We use this information to
determine Our members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better
understand and serve You and other members. This information may include the
URL of the website that You visited prior to the Service (whether this URL is
on the Service or not), the URL of the website You next go to (whether this URL
is on the Service or not), what browser You are using and Your Internet
Protocol address. Most cookies are "session cookies" meaning that
they are automatically deleted from Your hard drive at the end of a session.
You are always free not to accept cookies if Your browser permits. </p>

<p>We may use a
third party advertising company to serve ads on Our behalf across the Internet.
That advertising company may also collect anonymous information about Your
visits to the Service. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a
technology device, commonly referred to as a Web beacon, cookie or an action
tag, which is placed on various Web pages within the Service or in an HTML
e-mail that allows the third party advertising company to collect anonymous
information. There may also be a number of services offered by external service
providers that help You use the Service. If You choose to use these optional
services and in doing so disclose information to the external service providers
or grant them permission to collect information about You, then their use of
Your information will be governed by their private policies, if any.</p>

<h4>How We Use Personal Information</h4>

<p>We use
information in the data files We maintain about You, and the other information
We obtain from Your current and past activities on the Service to resolve
disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce Our Terms of Use. We may review the
data of multiple members to identify problems or resolve disputes.</p>

<p>We may use
personally identifiable information, data files and other information about You
including but not limited to images, video recordings, and audio recordings to
improve Our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze usage of the Service,
improve Our content and product offerings, and customize the Service content,
layout, and features. </p>

<p>We may use
Your information to contact You and to deliver information to You that may be
targeted to Your interests, such as banner advertisements, administrative
notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to Your use of the
Service. You agree to receive this information. If You do not wish to receive
this information, You may opt out of the receipt of certain communications. To
learn how to do so please go to the "Help" section of the Service. </p>

<h4>Email Policies</h4>

<p>By default,
we will send you weekly updates of various site information, a variety of
transactional emails such as when users send you a message and the occasional
site announcement. </p>



<h4>Inviting Friends</h4>

<p>Inviting
friends to VIETSON.com is always completely optional. When you choose to invite
friends, we will send an email to the addresses you enter indicating that it is
a message from you. We will share your name and email address with anyone you
invite so that they know who the invitation is coming from. If a friend does
not respond to the initial invitation after a little while, we will send up to
one reminder messages on your behalf. </p>

<p>For your
convenience, VIETSON.com offers the ability to import email addresses from
common address books such as Hotmail/Yahoo/<span class="SpellE">Gmail</span>/AOL.
If you choose to use this feature, we will access your address book using the
login details that you provide. We access your address book only once to
retrieve your friends' information so that you may select whom to invite. We do
not store your login details nor do we use them for any other purpose then to
retrieve your contacts. We never send invitations to contacts you do not
explicitly select and your invitations are the only email we will ever send to
your friends unless they register to join the site. </p>

<p>If you have
accidentally sent invitations you did not intend - please <a href="Contact.cfm">contact us</a> and we can cancel the reminder
message. </p>

<h4>Our Disclosure of Your
Information</h4>

<p>Although we
use industry-standard efforts to protect the personal information We collect
via the Service, we cannot guarantee that this information will not be accessed
by the government or third parties in certain circumstances. We may be required
by law to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or
third parties. &nbsp;In addition, third parties may unlawfully intercept or
access transmissions or private communications and members may abuse or misuse
Your information that they collect from the Service. Accordingly, You should
not expect that Your personally identifiable information or private
communications will remain private in all circumstances. </p>

<p>We do not
sell personally identifiable information about You to third parties (provided
that we may sell such information to a third party in connection with an
acquisition of all or part of our business). However, the following describes
some of the ways that Your personally identifiable information may be used or
disclosed.</p>

<p>We aggregate
personally identifiable information of Our members and disclose such
information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other
third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. We do not disclose to
these entities any information that could be used to identify You personally.
We do not disclose certain information, such as Your name, email address,
password, credit card number and bank account number, to marketing advertisers.
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on Our behalf. These
companies may employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising
effectiveness. </p>

<p>We may
require that you submit certain financial information, including Your credit
card billing information. We will use this information to bill You for use of
Our Services and products. By making a purchase, or engaging in any other kind
of activity or transaction that uses financial information on the Service, You
consent to Our providing Your financial information to Our service providers
and to such third parties as We determine necessary to support and process Your
transactions. These third parties may include the credit card companies and
banking institutions used to process and support Your transactions. By
purchasing, or registering for, or making reservations for products or services
of third parties offered on the Service, or by participating in programs
offered on the Service that are administered by third parties and that require
You to submit financial information in order to use them, You consent to Our
providing Your financial information to those third parties. These third
parties will be authorized to use Your financial information in accordance with
Our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with
their own privacy policies, over which We have no control, and You agree that
We are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. </p>

<p>We may share
data collected via the Service, including personally identifiable information
about You, with Our parent, affiliates, or subsidiaries. Our parent, affiliates
and subsidiaries will follow privacy practices no less protective of such
personal information than Our practices described in this Privacy Policy. It is
possible that We could merge with or be acquired by another business entity.
Should such merger or acquisition occur, We would share some or all of Your personal
information with the merger partner or acquiring party. The acquiring entity or
newly combined entity will follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy
Policy with respect to such information. </p>

<p>We cooperate
with law enforcement inquiries and with third parties to enforce laws. You
authorize Us to disclose any information about You to law enforcement and other
government officials as We in Our sole discretion believe necessary or
appropriate in connection with any investigation of fraud or other activity
that is illegal or may expose Us or You to liability. </p>

<h4>Your Use of Other Members'
Information</h4>

<p>Our services
may include access to instant messaging and chat rooms. As a member You have
access to members' identification numbers or user names and You might gain
access to other contact information of other members through the use of the
Service.&nbsp; You may not use such information in any manner that is not
authorized by Us and the applicable member. In all cases, You must give members
an opportunity to remove their information from Your information databases,
including email lists. &nbsp;Under no circumstances may You disclose personally
identifiable information about another member to any third party without Our
consent and the consent of such other member. You may not add a member to an
mail list (email or physical mail) without that memberâ€™s express consent. </p>

<h4>Accessing, Reviewing, and
Changing Your Profile</h4>

<p>After
registration You can review and change the information You submitted during
registration. For instructions on how to do so visit the "Help" section of the
Service. </p>

<p>Upon Your
request We will remove Your membership data from Our active databases as soon
as reasonably possible in accordance with Our policy and applicable law. To
learn how to hide or remove Your profile so that others cannot view it visit
the "Help" section of the Service. We may retain in Our files information You
have requested be removed from Our active databases for certain purposes, such
as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce the Terms of Use.
Moreover, such prior information may never be completely removed from Our
databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored â€˜back up'
systems. You should not expect that all of Your personally identifiable information
will be completely removed from Our databases in response to Your request.</p>

<h4>Control of Your Password</h4>

<p>You are
responsible for all actions taken with Your login information and password,
including any fees or charges incurred based on such use. If You choose to
share this information with a third party, You are responsible for all actions
taken with Your login information and password by such third party. If You
believe your password has been disclosed to third parties or otherwise
compromised in any way You should immediately change Your password.</p>

<h4>Third Party Use of Information</h4>

<p>This Privacy
Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information We collect from
You. If You disclose Your personal information to other parties, whether via
the Service or on other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may
apply to their use or disclosure of the information You disclose to them. We do
not control the privacy policies of any third parties so You should investigate
their policies before You disclose Your personal information to them.</p>

<h4>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>We may revise
this Privacy Policy from time to time based on changes in the law, Your
comments, or Our need to accurately reflect Our data collection and disclosure
practices. We will notify you of such revisions and such revisions shall become
effective in accordance with the procedures for revising the Terms of Use. </p>
