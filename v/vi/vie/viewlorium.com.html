      <h4>Flashback Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p> Viewlorium (a trading name of Flashback Holdings Pty   Limited) recognises   that your privacy is very important to you and   that it is your right to   control your personal information. We know   that providing personal   information is an act of trust and we take   that trust seriously.   FLASHBACK will never sell, rent or, except as   set out in this Privacy   Policy, otherwise disclose any of your   personal information, including   your Email address, to any third party   without your consent. Unless you   give us specific consent to act   otherwise, the following policies will   govern how FLASHBACK handles   the personal information that you provide   to us.</p>
        <h4>This Privacy Policy sets out:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Collection and use of information</li>
          <li>Information storage</li>
          <li>Information sharing and disclosure</li>
          <li>Security and prevention against loss, misuse or alteration of information</li>
          <li>Your ability to edit and cancel your account</li>
          <li>Changes to this Privacy Policy</li>
          <li>Contact details</li>
        </ul>
        <p> This Privacy Policy is deemed to be incorporated into the   Website Terms   and Conditions, which you should read together with this   Privacy Policy.   Capitalised words used but not defined in this   Privacy Policy have the   meaning given to them in the Terms and   Conditions.</p>
        <h4>Collection and use of information</h4>
        <p> If you do not register as a Member of FLASHBACK, the   information we   collect from you is limited. We log your IP address in   order to help   diagnose problems with our servers, administer this   Website and track   usage statistics. Your IP address may vary each time   you visit, or it   may be the same, depending on the type of internet   connection. Either   way, it would be extremely difficult for us to   identify you through your   IP address, and we make no attempt to do so.   If you reach this Website   by clicking on a link or advertisement on   another website, then we also   log that information. All of this   information is collected and used only   in aggregate; that is, it is   entered into our database, where we can   use it to generate overall   reports on our visitors, but not reports   about individual visitors.</p>
        <p>If you choose to register as a Member of FLASHBACK, you will   be able   to take advantage of all of the features of this Website.   FLASHBACK   collects some or all of the personally identifiable   information set out   below when you stream a movie on the FLASHBACK   service or register as a   Member of FLASHBACK, when you access and use   this Website and/or when   you use FLASHBACK’s Products and/or Services.   The information we collect   will vary depending on the circumstances,   e.g., if you use one of our   rental services packages or download film   or TV content, we will collect   most of this information. If you simply   use some of our services, (such   as writing a review or entering a   competition) we may only collect more   limited information.</p>
        <h4>What we collect</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Full name</li>
          <li>Email address</li>
          <li>Information about the films, TV series and other content that you have rented, bought, streamed or downloaded</li>
          <li>User Material you submit (e.g., your ratings, reviews, user collections, quiz and other user submissions)</li>
          <li>Information you submit for your User Profile</li>
          <li>From Facebook, your Facebook user name and profile picture if you choose to use the FLASHBACK Facebook Application</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>We do not collect</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Your credit card and billing information. This information   is   collected by our payment process provider. FLASHBACK neither   collects   nor stores this information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How we use it</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>To recommend other films, TV series and other content that you may like to rent, buy, stream or download.</li>
          <li>To display your favourites list to others.</li>
          <li>To communicate with you regarding your account or purchase of FLASHBACK’s Products or Services -related matters.</li>
          <li>To provide you with order and billing history information.</li>
          <li>To contact you about the products and/or services on this Website in which you have expressed an interest.</li>
          <li>To display your User Profile to others users of this Website (in accordance with your security settings).</li>
          <li>If chosen by you, to allow you to use the FLASHBACK Facebook Application (in accordance with your security settings).</li>
          <li>To email you offers, news and information.</li>
          <li>To send you samples of, or marketing materials relating   to, third   party products or services which we believe may be of   interest to you.   Such materials may accompany the discs you have   selected to rent, or may   be sent by us separately. Please note that at   no time is it necessary   for us to provide your personally   identifiable information to third   parties in order to send you these   materials.</li>
          <li>To improve services and enhance personalisation, we may   periodically   obtain information about you from other third party   sources from whom   we have lawfully obtained this data and add it to   your registration   information. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Additionally, authorised FLASHBACK personnel may update your     registration information to accurately reflect any new information     included in any communications received from you.</p>
        <h4>Communication Preferences</h4>
        <p> If you do not want to receive emails from us with offers,   news and   information, you can opt out of our newsletter in your “My   Account”   page.</p>
        <h4>Information storage</h4>
        <p> All information you provide to us is stored in Australia   only, on secure   servers that are protected in secure facilities,   including firewall   protection.</p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p> We use a number of different cookies on our site. If you do   not know   what cookies are, or how to control or delete them, then we   recommend   you visit http://www.aboutcookies.org for detailed guidance.</p>
        <p>The list below describe the cookies we use on this site and   what we   use them for. Currently we operate an ‘implied consent’ policy   which   means that we assume you are happy with this usage. If you are   not   happy, then you should either not use this site, or you should   delete   the cookies having visited the site, or you should browse the   site using   your browser’s anonymous usage setting (called “Incognito”   in Chrome,   “InPrivate” for Internet Explorer, “Private Browsing” in   Firefox and   Safari etc.)<br>
        </p>
        <h4>First Party Cookies</h4>
        <p> These are cookies that are set by this website directly.</p>
        <p><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to   collect   information about visitor behaviour on our website. Google   Analytics   stores information about what pages you visit, how long you   are on the   site, how you got here and what you click on. This   Analytics data is   collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our   site and is not tied   to personally identifiable information.We   therefore do not collect or   store your personal information (e.g. your   name or address) so this   information cannot be used to identify who   you are. We have turned on   Google Analytics Demographics and Interest   Reporting to get an idea of   our demographics and users’ interests.   Please see above for how we use   this data, you can opt-out from Google   Analytics <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881">here</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>WordPress:</strong> Our websites runs the popular   WordPress   CMS and cookies are used to store basic data on your   interactions with   WordPress, and whether you have logged into   WordPress. We use a session   cookie to remember your log-in for you if   you are a registered user and   we deem these as being strictly   necessary to the working of the website.   If these are disabled then   various functionality on the site will be   broken.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Third Party Cookies</h4>
        <p> These are cookies set on your machine by external websites   whose   services are used on this site. Cookies of this type are the   sharing   buttons across the site allow visitors to share content onto   social   networks. Cookies are currently set by Twitter, Facebook,   Google+,   GitHub and Pinterest. In order to implement these buttons,   and connect   them to the relevant social networks and external sites,   there are   scripts from domains outside of our website. You should be   aware that   these sites are likely to be collecting information about   what you are   doing all around the internet, including on this website.   If you’d like   information on how to disable companies tracking your   web use, email us   at <a href="mailto:info@viewlorium.com">info@viewlorium.com</a>.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Third Party Advertising</h4>
        <p> FLASHBACK works with third party advertising service   providers and   allows such third parties to target and serve   advertising on our   Website, and we may use cookies, pixels or other   similar technologies to   collect non-personally identifiable data for   use in connection with the   delivery of such advertising. </p>
        <h4>Information sharing and disclosure</h4>
        <p> FLASHBACK is committed to protecting your personal   information. We will   not disclose your personally identifiable   information to third parties   without your consent except:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where FLASHBACK is required by law to disclose information to third parties;</li>
          <li>Where the disclosure is necessary for the performance of   our   operations (eg. mail delivery, hosting services, protecting us   from   fraud, and payment of your account); or</li>
          <li>FLASHBACK buys or sells subsidiaries or business units in   connection   with a corporate transaction, such as a sale, merger,   consolidation or   asset sale, or an internal reorganisation, or in the   unlikely event of   an insolvency. If such a transaction or event   required the transfer of   customer information, then that information   would be one of the   transferred assets, but would remain subject to   the commitments made in   any pre-existing Privacy Policy or equivalent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> We also may share your personal information with third   parties (ie   agents or sub-contractors) specifically engaged by   FLASHBACK to provide   services to us, in which case we will require   those parties to keep that   information confidential and secure and to   use it solely for the   purpose of providing the specified services to   us.</p>
        <p>Companies and individuals registered in the FLASHBACK   Affiliate   Programs receive aggregate information about customers that   they direct   to FLASHBACK through links on their websites. No   personally identifiable   information is provided to affiliate members.   The information collected   from our affiliates is used strictly for the   affiliates program and   will not be used for general marketing   purposes.</p>
        <p>FLASHBACK also provides analyses of our customers in the   aggregate to   prospective partners, advertisers, movie distributors and   other third   parties. We do this so that we and our business partners   can understand   you better, and so we can keep bringing you first-rate   services. We may   also disclose, on an anonymous basis, literal   statements made by our   customers. At no time, however, will we   disclose personal information   about specific customers.</p>
        <p>Linked websites are not under the control of FLASHBACK, and   we are   not responsible for the conduct of companies linked to our   Website,   including Facebook, should you choose to use the FLASHBACK   Facebook   Application. Before disclosing your personal information on   any other   website we advise you to examine its terms and conditions of   use and   privacy policy.</p>
        <h4>Security and prevention against loss, misuse or alteration of information</h4>
        <p>FLASHBACK has implemented technology and security features,   as well   as strict internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of   your personal   information from unauthorised access or improper use. We   will continue   to enhance our security procedures as new technology   becomes available.</p>
