                    <p>When you visit or use any of the iGain Sites and Features or our Services, you may be required to share information that identifies you personally. "Personal Information" refers to any information that can reasonably be used to identify, contact or locate you. Examples of Personal Information may include, without limitation, your name, your location, your credit card number, your email address, your mailing address, and your phone number.  We also collect profile data (like occupation, shopping habits, hobbies, interests, product ownership and other areas of interest) as certain elements of our Services may be directed to those participants who meet a particular profile.</p>
                    <p>Generally, we collect Personal Information when you provide it to us by visiting the iGain Sites and Features or using our Services. This may include registering for any account with us, filling out surveys, joining a mailing list, corresponding with us, entering one of our sweepstakes or contests, choosing to submit testimonials, stories, photos or the like, or otherwise volunteering or providing information about yourself.</p>
                    <p>We may use your Personal Information and other information we collect about you in order to provide you with our Services, to improve the iGain Sites and Features, to provide advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions, and rewards, and for other marketing, administrative and general business purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>If you don't provide us with your Personal Information, we will generally be unable to provide you with our Services and you will be unable to use the iGain Sites and Features.</p>
                    <p>You have the right to access your personal data to correct or delete it at any time.  All personal data can be found under the "account" section of the applicable website you are a member of, or you can make a request directly via <a href="mailto:privacy@igain.com" target="_blank">privacy@igain.com</a>, at which time you may request a copy or deletion of your personal data.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 id="otherUser">2. <span>Other User Information We Collect</span></h3>
                    <p>We may collect certain other information each time you visit iGain Sites and Features or use our Services so we can improve the overall quality of your online experience. This kind of information is not ordinarily considered personally identifying information. For example, we collect or may collect your IP address, device ID, referrer data, and browser and platform type. You do not have to register on any of the iGain Sites and Features or provide any Personal Information to us before we can collect this information. We may assign an ID number to your registration and link additional data to that ID number, such as the date and time you visited, the information you provide, and the links you choose to click. Like most standard website servers, we use log files to collect and store this user information. We may analyze and use this information for a variety of purposes, including operating and improving the iGain Sites and Features or our Services, collecting further information about and learning from user behavior and trends, and gathering demographic information. Furthermore, we may combine or link information we collect from or about you offline with information we collect from or about you online through the iGain Sites and Features or your use of our Services.</p>
                    <p>We may also use GPS or similar geo-location technology to determine the city and/or geo-coordinates of where you are located, including when you are using a mobile device. As noted in the section on "Sharing" below, we may use and share your location information with our advertisers, merchant and survey partners, or others in order to provide you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions, and rewards, or for other marketing, administrative and general business purposes, based on your location.</p>
                    <p>In addition, our mobile applications may collect, among other things, certain information automatically, including, but not limited to the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device identifier (UDID), the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the mobile application.</p>

                    <h3 id="informationWe">3. <span>Information We Receive from Third Parties</span></h3>
                    <p>We may also receive and supplement the information we directly collect from or about you with information from third parties. If you are on a third-party website or service and you opt-in to receive information from us, the third party may forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. In addition, we may receive information from advertisers, merchant or survey partners, and others to ensure that you properly receive any earned rewards or for other marketing, administrative or general business purposes. We may also supplement and combine the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to provide you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions and rewards, and for other business purposes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 id="friendReferrals">4. <span>Friend Referrals</span></h3>
                    <p>We may provide you with an opportunity to invite your friends, family and acquaintances ("Friends") to use various iGain Sites and Features. If you elect to use our referral service for informing a Friend about any of the iGain Sites and Features, you will provide us with your Friend's name and email address. Using our referral service permits us to automatically send the Friend one or more emails or other communications, on your behalf, inviting them to visit or register for the iGain Sites and Features (which invite may include additional subsequent reminders and communications). You warrant and represent that you have your Friend's consent to provide us with his or her information for this purpose, and that you will not give us referral information for any person not permitted to use the iGain Sites and Features, including, without limitation a child under the age of 13, a person whose account has previously been suspended or deactivated, or a person residing or located in a territory where use of the iGain Sites and Features is not authorized.</p>

                    <h3 id="communityFeatures">5. <span>Community Features and User Content</span></h3>
                    <p>The iGain Sites and Features may provide you the opportunity to participate in and post text (including questions, comments, and suggestions), images, audio, videos, or other content (collectively, "User Content") publicly through our blogs, chat rooms, forums, interactive features, third-party social networking services or other communication functionality ("Community Features"). Please note that certain information, such as your username and profile picture, may be publicly displayed on the iGain Sites and Features along with your User Content. Your User Content may also contain metadata, which may contain information about or relating to you, that we may also collect, share and use.</p>
                    <p>Note that anything you post through Community Features is public — others will have access to that User Content and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in the User Content, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will no longer apply to that information. In addition, by posting through our Community Features, you are agreeing that we may use your User Content and excerpts from your User Content in connection with our advertising, marketing, and promotional activities.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 id="thirdParty">6. <span>Third-Party Links</span></h3>
                    <p>The iGain Sites and Features contain links to other websites that we do not own. In addition, because aspects of the iGain Sites and Features include third-party offers for goods, services and the like, third parties may collect your information based on your interaction with those offers. Third-party privacy practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage our users to be aware of and to read the privacy statements and similar disclosures of any third-party website that collects personally identifiable information before using or disclosing any personally identifiable information to such website.</p>

                    <h3 id="advertisingNetworks">7. <span>Advertising Networks and Analytics Companies</span></h3>
                    <p>We may allow other companies, commonly called third-party ad servers or advertising networks (collectively, "ad networks"), to display advertisements on the iGain Sites and Features. These advertisements may be based on your interests as reflected in your use of the iGain Sites and Features or our Services, as well as your use of other websites and services. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie or other similar technology on your computer, allowing them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you see their advertisements online and determine which ads you click on, so that they may provide you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions, and rewards that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control over the cookies or other similar technologies that may be placed by these parties on your computer, nor do we have responsibility for these parties' privacy policies or information collection practices. Likewise, we may also work with consumer data resellers that buy and/or sell information to other companies for multiple purposes including offering products and services that may interest you, and we use certain third-party analytics providers to help us understand how you use the iGain Sites and Features or our Services, and these companies may set their own cookies and similar technologies on your computer or mobile device. These and other third parties may collect information about you, including but not limited to your online activities over time and across different websites and services, when you use the iGain Sites and Features or our Services, or other online websites and services. Third parties also  collect information in emails/communications. Each of these third parties has its own privacy policy that may differ from this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>We may share your Personal Information and other information with our advertisers, merchant and survey partners, and others for the purpose of making it easier for you to sign up for their surveys, promotions and offers, validating your communications or transactions with them, authenticating and/or validating your identification, crediting you with any earned rewards, and other business purposes. Additionally, we may share information with our service providers and other third parties to assist us in delivering content, advertising, surveys, offers, promotions and rewards to you, both on the iGain Sites and Features and elsewhere online, and for other marketing, administrative and general business purposes.</p>

                    <p>We have partnered with Survey Sampling International, LLC ("SSI") to provide you with additional survey opportunities for you to earn our rewards. In connection with this partnership, we will pass certain personal data and social/demographic information to SSI for use in connection with the purposes set forth in its privacy policy <a href="https://www.rnssiprivacy.com/" target="_blank">available here.</a></p>

                    <p>Certain functionality on the iGain Sites and Features may permit interactions that you initiate between the iGain Sites and Features and a third-party website or service, such as Facebook and Twitter ("Social Features").

Similarly, if you post information on a third-party platform that references any of the iGain Sites and Features (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with any of the iGain Sites and Features in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on the iGain Sites and Features in accordance with the terms of the third-party website or service. Also, both we and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the iGain Sites and Features and the third-party website or service.

                    <p>The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy.

                    <p>We may disclose your Personal Information when required by law, or where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial or administrative proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on us. We may also share your Personal Information at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, or if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy for any of the iGain Sites and Features or our Services. We may also use IP addresses or other device identifiers to identify users, and we may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. These transfers and disclosures may occur without notice to you.</p>
                    <p>We may also share your Personal Information with our affiliates for administrative, marketing and other business purposes, and with third-party service providers in connection with the service providers' performance of services to, or on behalf of, the iGain Sites and Features or our Services. Such services include, for example, customer support, collecting and analyzing information about usage of the iGain Sites and Features or our Services, delivering advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions and rewards to you on the iGain Sites and Features or elsewhere online, processing payments, and performing other administrative, marketing and other business services.</p>
                    <p>In addition, if you use our mobile applications, we may share your current location with our partners so that we or our partners may provide you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions, and rewards, and for other business purposes, based on your location.

                    <p>In the event the Company (or any of its affiliates) goes through a business transition, such as a merger, consolidation, restructuring, acquisition by another company, sale or assignment of rights or assets or a portion thereof, or other company change, we may transfer users' information, including Personal Information, and other business data in connection with that business transition (e.g., to a subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of any of the iGain Sites and Features, or any affiliates and trusted agents, service providers, or partners of the foregoing), including during the course of any due diligence process.</p>

                    <h3 id="digitalFingerprinting">12. <span>Digital Fingerprinting</span></h3>
                    <p>We may use digital fingerprinting technologies to assign a unique identifier or "Machine-ID" to a user's computer to identify and track the computer. iGain works principally with a third-party provider to deploy this technology (the "Technology") and does not use it to collect personally identifiable information, or track the online activities, of the user of a computer; and will not disrupt or interfere with the use or control of a computer or alter, modify or change the settings or functionality of a computer. We use the unique identifier to assist our clients in ensuring the integrity of survey results. The third-party provider analyzes publicly available information and data obtained from the computer's web browser and from other publicly available data points, including without limitation the technical settings of the computer, the characteristics of the computer, and the computer's IP Address, to create a unique identifier assigned to the computer. The unique identifier is an alpha-numeric id. After creating the unique identifier, we do not retain the information analyzed by the Technology to create the unique identifier. Additionally, to assist our clients in protecting and ensuring the integrity of survey results, we (a) may link or associate your unique identifier to you and any of your personally identifiable information; (b) may share your unique identifier with our clients and with other sample or panel providers; and (c) may receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you from a third party, including without limitation a sample or panel provider or a client of iGain. Any unique identifier(s) received or obtained by iGain and linked to a specific individual will be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will provide notice of such changes by sending you an administrative email and/or posting those changes in places on the iGain Sites and Features deemed appropriate by us so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances it may be shared with others. Your continued use of any of the iGain Sites and Features or our Services after delivery of the administrative email to you or after the changes are posted constitutes your agreement to the changes. If you do not agree to the changes, please discontinue your use of such iGain Sites and Features and our Services. To the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that applying any changes to this Privacy Policy to any prior events or circumstances would render this an illusory or unenforceable contract, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of such changes, to the extent necessary to avoid this Privacy Policy being deemed illusory or unenforceable. In any event, if any Personal Information was previously submitted to or collected by us pursuant to an earlier version of this Privacy Policy that required a certain notice period prior to any changes being effective, any changes under this Privacy Policy will not be effective as to you or such previously-collected Personal Information until the previously-specified notice period has passed after the date of this Privacy Policy.</p>
