<span class="faqQuestion">Information collected and used by Vindale Research</span>

<p>
    Vindale Research collects user-submitted information including name, email address,
    and age to verify new accounts
    and send notifications regarding Vindale Research's
    services. Vindale Research collects additional optional data that is
    included in member profiles. This data includes but is not limited to: occupation, interests, school affiliations,
    gender, and address.
</p>

<p>
    We also collect non-personally identifiable information including IP address and browser type to help run the site
    more efficiently.

</p>

<span class="faqQuestion">Use of information members submit to Vindale Research</span>

<p>
    Email addresses are used to send notifications related to the service(s) the user has signed up for, as a
    confirmation when a Vindale Research member has requested to add another member as a
    friend, and to invite new
    friends to join Vindale Research. A user may choose to stop receiving email
    notifications from Vindale Research at
    any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email. When the user sends email or other
    communication to Vindale Research, Vindale Research may
    retain those communications in order to process the user's
    inquiries, respond to the user's requests and improve Vindale Research's services.
</p>

<p>
    Vindale Research provides members with the opportunity to upload a self-portrait
    and/or a testimonial of our service. We will not sell, share or publish your personally identifiable information,
    but reserve the right to use your first name, last initial, city and state for our testimonials. If you would like
    to your self-portrait and/or testimonial to remain confidential, please express your intention clearly when you
    submit your self-portrait and/or testimonial. The specific use of your personal information will be defined at the
    point of collection. Should Vindale Research wish to change anything regarding the use
    of your personal information, a prominent notice will be displayed on this website.
</p>

<span class="faqQuestion">Use of non-personally identifiable information</span>

<p>
    Vindale Research uses your IP address and browser type for the general administration
    of the website. Demographic
    information you provide such as age, postal code, gender and country of residence may be used to target surveys,
    advertisements and special offers. In cases where advertisements are being displayed by a third-party,
    non-personally identifiable information may be passed to the third-party to allow for targeting.
</p>

<span class="faqQuestion">Sharing of collected information with third parties</span>

<p>
    Except in cases where members are expressly informed otherwise, Vindale Research does
    not sell, rent, share, trade
    or give away any of your personal information unless required by law to do so. In certain
    circumstances, Vindale Research
    may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable fashion to
    advertisers or other third parties for the purpose of delivering more targeted advertising, products and services to
    members. In these instances Vindale Research will only disclose information that will
    be used to personally identify
    you if you grant permission through an opt-in process. Vindale Research reserves the
    right to transfer personal
    information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale
    of Vindale Research
    or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.


</p>

<span class="faqQuestion">Communications to Non-members</span>

<p>
    When members choose to use Vindale Research's Invite-a-Friend service, the member is
    prompted to input their
    friend's email address. Vindale Research will automatically send an email to that
    address with a message inviting
    the recipient to join the Vindale Research
    community. Vindale Research stores these email addresses for the purpose
    of automatically adding the invitee to the member's friend list upon signing
    up. Vindale Research will not send more
    than one follow up email to an invitee for any given peer referral. Should the invitee explicitly decline to join
    Vindale Research and opt out of receiving any future
    emails, Vindale Research will cease to send the receiver any
    future emails, even if additional peer referrals are given.
</p>

<span class="faqQuestion">Use of cookies</span>

<p>
    Vindale Research uses cookies to manage sessions on the site, remember user
    preferences, and to ensure members do
    not continually see the same advertisements. Cookies must be enabled in order for members to

    services. Information stored in cookies will never contain any personally identifiable information. Third parties
    also place scripts and cookies on our site such as analytics providers. This data is only collected in the
    aggregate.
