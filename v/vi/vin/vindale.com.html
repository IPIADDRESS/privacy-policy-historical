    to your self-portrait and/or testimonial to remain confidential, please express your intention clearly when you

<p>
    Vindale Research offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that these are public forums 
    and any information you provide may be read, collected, and used by anyone, including non-members and third-party hosting 
    services.  Commenters may register anonymously.  However, be aware that if a commenter posts something in violation of our

</p>

<span class="faqQuestion">Social Media (Features) and Widgets</span>
<p>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this
    button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page
    you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features
    and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features
    are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
</p>

<span class="faqQuestion">Use of non-personally identifiable information</span>

<p>
    Vindale Research uses your IP address and browser type for the general administration
    of the website. Demographic
    information you provide such as age, postal code, gender and country of residence may be used to target surveys,
    advertisements and special offers. In cases where advertisements are being displayed by a third-party,
    non-personally identifiable information may be passed to the third-party to allow for targeting.
</p>

<span class="faqQuestion">Sharing of collected information with third parties</span>

<p>
    Except in cases where members are expressly informed otherwise, Vindale Research does
    not sell, rent, share, trade
    or give away any of your personal information unless required by law to do so. In certain
    circumstances, Vindale Research
    may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable fashion to
    advertisers or other third parties for the purpose of delivering more targeted advertising, products and services to
    members. In these instances Vindale Research will only disclose information that will
    be used to personally identify
    you if you grant permission through an opt-in process. Vindale Research reserves the
    right to transfer personal
    information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale
    of Vindale Research
    or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.


</p>

<span class="faqQuestion">Communications to Non-members</span>

<p>
    When members choose to use Vindale Research's Invite-a-Friend service, the member is
    prompted to input their
    friend's email address. Vindale Research will automatically send an email to that
    address with a message inviting
    the recipient to join the Vindale Research
    community. Vindale Research stores these email addresses for the purpose
    of automatically adding the invitee to the member's friend list upon signing
    up. Vindale Research will not send more
    than one follow up email to an invitee for any given peer referral. Should the invitee explicitly decline to join
    Vindale Research and opt out of receiving any future
    emails, Vindale Research will cease to send the receiver any
    future emails, even if additional peer referrals are given.
</p>

<span class="faqQuestion">Use of cookies</span>

<p>
    Vindale Research uses cookies to manage sessions on the site, remember user
    preferences, and to ensure members do
    not continually see the same advertisements. Cookies must be enabled in order for members to
    use Vindale Research
