<br><br>
<b>1.	Personal Information</b><br><br>
a.	Non-Account Activity. You can watch videos on ViiKii.net or ViiKii.com (collectively, “ViiKii” or the “ViiKii Sites,” which are operated by VIIKII, INC.) without having a ViiKii Account. You can also contact us about a particular video without having a ViiKii Account.<br><br>
b.	Account-Related Activity. Certain other activities on ViiKii — like submitting videos, posting comments, posting subtitles — require you to have a ViiKii Account. We ask for some personal information when you create a ViiKii Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.<br><br>
c.	Usage Information. We may record information about your usage, such as when you use ViiKii, the channels you subscribe to, the contacts you communicate with, the videos you watch, and the frequency and size of data transfers, as well as information you display or click on in ViiKii (including UI elements, settings, and other information).<br><br>
d.	Content Uploaded to Site. Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your playback or profile pages, etc.) becomes publicly available and could be collected and used by others. <br><br>
<b>2.	Uses</b><br><br>
a.	If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the ViiKii Sites, we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the general and personalized features and functionality of the ViiKii Sites, and to process any activity or correspondence you send to us.<br><br>
b.	Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you submit videos or send messages through the ViiKii Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the ViiKii Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.<br><br>
c.	We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major ViiKii Site changes or for customer service purposes).<br><br>
d.	We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the ViiKii Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, analyzing, and processing user preferences and trends, as well as user activity and communications.<br><br>
e.	We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the ViiKii Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.<br><br>
f.	We may disclose personal information to government agencies and officials as required by law or in response to information requests.<br><br>
g.	We may disclose your personal information to a successor or acquiring entity as part of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or other transaction involving all or substantially all of our assets.<br><br>
<b>3.	Information That is Publicly Available</b><br><br>
a.	When you create an account on the site, some information about your account and your account activity will be provided to other Users of the site. This may include the date you opened your account, the date you last logged into your account, and the country.<br><br>
b.	Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you engage in certain activity on the site, such as when you upload videos or send messages through the ViiKii Sites. Other Users can contact you through messages and comments.<br><br>
c.	You may also choose to add personal information that will be visible to other Users on your channel page (which is the public facing page for your account on the site). This may include a profile picture, your name, gender, relationship status, or other details.<br><br>
d.	If you choose to add certain features to your channel page, then these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other Users and may be aggregated and shared with your confirmed friends or other Users.<br><br>
e.	Any videos that you submit to the ViiKii Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.   <br><br>
<b>4.	Your Choices</b><br><br>
a.	You may decline to submit personally identifiable information through the ViiKii Sites, in which case you can still view videos and explore the ViiKii Sites, but ViiKii may not be able to provide certain services to you.<br><br>
b.	You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. <br><br>
c.	You may control the information that is available to other Users and your confirmed friends at any time by editing your account. <br><br>
<b>5.	Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</b><br><br>
ViiKii allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the ViiKii Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the ViiKii Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.<br><br>
ViiKii does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks ViiKii to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the ViiKii Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.<br><br>
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. ViiKii's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with ViiKii is maintained and dealt with by ViiKii in accordance with this privacy policy.<br><br>
<b>6.	Transfer of Information to Other Countries</b><br><br>
ViiKii’s processing of the information that it collects may involve the transfer of that information to various countries around the world. By submitting your information to ViiKii via the ViiKii Sites or in connection with your interactions with ViiKii offline, you consent to such transfers and to the processing of this information in various countries around the world.<br><br>
<b>7.	Policy Updates</b><br><br>
We may update this policy from time to time, and the updated version of this policy will be effective upon posting. Please check this page to review the most up-to-date version of this policy.<br><br>
<b>8.	No Use by Minors</b><br><br>
The ViiKii Site is intended for use by adults only. We do not promote the ViiKii Site to children or intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.<br><br>
<b>9.	Your California Privacy Rights</b><br><br>
Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as S.B. 27), if you are a California resident and your business relationship with ViiKii is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, you may request certain data regarding ViiKii’s disclosure, if any, of personal information to third parties for the third-parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail message to privacy@viikii.com with "Request for California Privacy Information" in the subject line. You may make such a request up to once per calendar year. If applicable, we will provide you, by e-mail, a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the third parties' names and addresses. Please note that not all personal information sharing is covered by S.B. 27's requirements.<br><br>
