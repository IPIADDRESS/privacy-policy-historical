      <p class="style1 style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style1">Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on<br>
        the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to<br>
        use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities<br>
        with complete confidence. </p>
      <p class="style1">We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment<br>
        to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company<br>
        collects information from all end users of our Internet services (the<br>
        "Services")-those who access some of our Services but do not have<br>
        accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or<br>
        pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what<br>
        we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and<br>
        Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. We<br>
        request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. </p>
      <p class="style1">*Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used*</p>
      <p class="style1">Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from<br>
        Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and<br>
        the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this<br>
        information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our<br>
        Products and Services, and generally, do not share this information with<br>
        third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected<br>
        if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special<br>
        circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required<br>
        by law or other special cases described below. </p>
      <p class="style1">Registration:  Members may be asked to provide certain personal<br>
        information when they sign up for our Products or Services including<br>
        name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit<br>
        card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the<br>
        Services. The personal information collected from Members during the<br>
        registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as<br>
        for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third<br>
        parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.</p>
      <p class="style1"> However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote<br>
        our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information,<br>
        such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the<br>
        Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of<br>
        allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. </p>
      <p class="style1">In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner<br>
        for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and<br>
        aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during<br>
        registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members).<br>
        As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and<br>
        non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the<br>
        Services. </p>
      <p class="style1">Our Company Partners and Sponsors:  Some products and services may be<br>
        offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate,<br>
        independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide<br>
        Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner<br>
        may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these<br>
        instances, you will be notified before any such data is collected or<br>
        transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or feature. </p>
      <p class="style1">Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web<br>
        Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor<br>
        seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share non-identifying<br>
        and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal<br>
        information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded<br>
        products or services offered. </p>
      <p class="style1">Online Shopping:  At some Web sites, you can purchase products and<br>
        services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog<br>
        or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to<br>
        provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address,<br>
        phone number, and credit/debit card information. </p>
      <p class="style1">If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order<br>
        sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information<br>
        about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone<br>
        number. Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any<br>
        personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please<br>
        exercise care when doing so. </p>
      <p class="style1">If you order services or products directly from our company we will use<br>
        the personal information you provide only to process that order. We do<br>
        not share this information with outside parties except to the extent<br>
        necessary to complete that order. </p>
      <p class="style1">Online Advertisements:  Our company may display our online<br>
        advertisements. In those cases we share aggregated and non-identifying<br>
        information about our Visitors and Members collected through the<br>
        registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions<br>
        with these advertisers. </p>
      <p class="style1">Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and<br>
        non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint<br>
        ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us<br>
        the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement<br>
        tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying<br>
        information we have collected, we may then display or send the<br>
        advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does not share<br>
        personal information about its Visitors or Members with these<br>
        advertisers or joint venture companies.</p>
      <p class="style1">Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email<br>
        inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the<br>
        email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return email<br>
        address for any other purpose and does not share the return email<br>
        address with any third party. </p>
      <p class="style1">Voluntary Customer Surveys:  We may periodically conduct both business<br>
        and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to<br>
        participate in these surveys because they provide us with important<br>
        information that helps us to improve the types of products and services<br>
        we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and<br>
        responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is<br>
        conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is<br>
        voluntary. </p>
      <p class="style1">We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to<br>
        our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of<br>
        other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the<br>
        survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education,<br>
        employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then<br>
        use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to<br>
        you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated,<br>
        non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.</p>
      <p class="style1">Special Cases:  It is our company's policy not to use or share the<br>
        personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the<br>
        ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt<br>
        out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. </p>
      <p class="style1">However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members,<br>
        or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites<br>
        accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole<br>
        discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit<br>
        agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law<br>
        enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications<br>
        Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental<br>
        or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is<br>
        necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone<br>
        who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or<br>
        other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our<br>
        company and our Members. </p>
      <p class="style1">"Cookies" and How Our Company Uses Them. A "cookie" is a small data file<br>
        that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites.<br>
        Our company may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track<br>
        information for statistical purposes to improve the products and<br>
        services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. </p>
      <p class="style1">If you are a Visitor or Member we may use a cookie to save your settings<br>
        and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do<br>
        not enable third parties to access any of your customer information.<br>
        Additionally, be aware that if you visit other Web sites where you are<br>
        prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to<br>
        accept cookies. </p>
      <p class="style1">Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not<br>
        control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for<br>
        information collected through them. </p>
      <p class="style1">Our Company Commitment to Children's Privacy. Protecting children's<br>
        privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with<br>
        the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other<br>
        applicable laws. Therefore we restrict our Web site to persons eighteen<br>
        years or older.</p>

        ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ACCESS THIS<br>
        WEB SITE FOR ANY REASON. DUE TO THE AGE RESTRICTIONS FOR USE OF THIS WEB<br>
        SITE, NO INFORMATION OBTAINED BY THIS WEB SITE, FALLS WITHIN THE CHILD<br>
        ONLINE PRIVACY ACT (COPA) AND IS NOT MONITORED AS DOING SO. </p>

        any Member Directory, or other public areas of our Web sites or the<br>
        Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise caution when<br>

        sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and<br>
        alteration of the information under our control. While we make every<br>
        effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems,<br>
        we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party<br>
        "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information. </p>

        questions about this Privacy Policy or the practices described herein,<br>
