				      on Interactive Media.</p>
				    <p>We collect personal information from our visitors only on a voluntary
				      basis. Personal information may include name, address,
				      phone number, email address, and other relevant data. We
				      do not require this personal information to obtain access to most of
				      our site. We do, however, require it in order to properly fulfill requests
				      for brochures and other information.</p>
				    <p>The personal information we collect is used by us only to process
				      a request for information by you or for marketing our products or services.
				      We do not sell or rent personal information to other organizations.</p>
				    <p>Our web server also collects the domain names, but not the e-mail
				      addresses, of visitors to our website. This information is aggregated
				      to measure number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages
				      viewed, and other relevant statistics. We collect this information
				      to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site.</p>
				    <p>The VisitNC website contains "links" to other sites, and
				      we attempt to only link to sites that share our high standards and
				      respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content
				      or the privacy practices employed by other sites and you are responsible
				      for your visits to those sites.</p>

				      personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored

				      you.</p>
				    <p>We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content
