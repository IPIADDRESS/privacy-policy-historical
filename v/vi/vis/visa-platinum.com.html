          	<p>Visa wants you to feel secure when visiting Visalatam.com. Committed to protecting your privacy, Visa ("we", "us" or "our") safeguards your personal information to maintain customer trust.</p>

          	<p>Visa respects the privacy of visitors of Visa.com and its related sites (collectively "Visa site") by disclosing and explaining in this Privacy Policy ("Policy") how Visa collects, uses and shares information about you from Visa.com and the choices that you can make about the way your information is collected, used and shared. Visa encourages you to read this Policy and those of all web sites you visit.</p>
          	<p>The following sections address the Visa sites privacy issues in more detail:</p>
          	<p class="Titulo"><em>In this page:</em></p>
          	<section>
				<h4 class="Active">Sites covered by this Privacy Policy <strong>»</strong></h4>
				<div>

					<p>This Policy applies to all services and sub-sites available under the domain www.visa.com (excluding usa.visa.com). Although this is a global privacy policy, each regional or country site may have rules and regulations that are not covered by this Policy. We encourage you to read your regional or countrys privacy policy before using the site. By visiting this web site, you are agreeing in advance to the current and future terms of this Policy. If you do not wish to agree to these terms, you should leave this web site.</p>
					
				</div>
				<h4>Types of information collected on Visa.com <strong>»</strong></h4>
				<div>
					<p>There are two types of information collected on the Visa site: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
					<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>

					Personally Identifiable Information ("personal information") is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address, age range, etc. Personal information is only obtained when you voluntarily provide the information to us. Visa uses personal information to better understand your needs and interests and to provide you with better service. For example, you may be asked to voluntarily submit your email address to us when communicating with us or your name and email address when entering a sweepstakes or contest.</p>
					<p>On occasion, Visa may ask you to voluntarily submit information about other people. For example, this may be done to send them a link to a web page or sign them up for a promotion.</p>
					<p>Once you choose to provide us with personal information, you can be assured it will be used only to support your relationship with Visa. We take seriously the trust you place in us and will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others.</p>
					<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
					<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("non-personal information") is information that does not identify you as an individual, such as your browser type, IP Address, the URL of the previous web site you visited, etc. Visa may automatically collect certain types of non-personal information from you when using the Visa site. We may also collect non-personal information that you voluntarily provide, such as information included in response to a questionnaire or survey.</p>

				</div>

				<h4>Why we collect your information <strong>»</strong></h4>
				<div>
					<p>Visas primary purpose in collecting personal information on the Visa site is to provide you with a safe and efficient experience and to provide you with services and features that better meet your needs or requests. We only collect information that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>
					
				</div>
				<h4>How we collect information <strong>»</strong></h4>
				<div>

					<p><strong>Information Collected Through You</strong>If you choose to use certain services on the Visa site, we may require you to provide contact and identity information. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. If you choose not to use a particular service or feature, you do not have to provide the contact or identity information it calls for.</p>
					<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Through Technology</strong></p>
					<p>Cookies:<br>
					  The Visa site may use cookie technology to improve your experience on the Visa site and gather data for web site statistical reporting. Cookie technology does not capture your individual email address or any personal information about you.</p>
					<p>A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web site that is saved on your hard disk by your computers browser. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience (i.e., rotating images on Visa.com home page) and gathers web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the Internet providers domain name and country that our visitors come from and the addresses of sites visited immediately before and after coming to the Visa site. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual and is measured only in aggregate.</p>
					<p>To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) Your experience of the Visa site may be different if you set your browser to block cookies.</p>

					<p>The Visa site may use web beacons to serve advertising, enhance email advertising and track usage of the Visa site. We use third parties to manage web beacons and the data they collect. Web beacons do not capture your individual email address or any other personal information.</p>
					<p>Web beacons:<br>
					Web beacons, also called clear GIFs (a common format for image files), are invisible files on web pages that you visit. If you visit a page on Visa.com that contains a web beacon, it communicates with your computer to determine, among other things, whether you have been to that page before or viewed a particular advertisement.</p>
					<p>IP Address:<br>
					  The Visa site may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, server problem diagnosis and compiling aggregate information (such as how many visitors logged on to the Visa site). When you visit a particular web page on the Visa site, our servers log your IP address. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet.</p>
					
				</div>

To provide a co-branded service to you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information with our partners. The partner will only be able to use the information as necessary to perform the requested service or in aggregate form for statistical reporting.</p>
					<p>Remember, if you go to other web sites, including those of our partners, advertisers, merchants and other sites that link to our site, those other sites may collect personal and non-personal information about you. The information practices of those other sites are not covered by this Policy. We have no liability or responsibility for those sites or their own policies.</p>
