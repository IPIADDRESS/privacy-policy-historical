<h3>Updating, accessing or removing personal information held by us</h3>
<p>The Data Protection Act requires that information held about a Customer/User must be accurate and up to date.

A £10 administration fee may be charged for complying with a subject access request and we shall provide such information within 40 days of your request.</p>
<p>In addition to requiring information to be up to date, the Act also provides that information should not be held or processed for longer than is necessary. You can therefore request that your details be deleted from our database at any time, although we would require written authority (or e-mail) from you in order to do this. Please note however that we are required by law to retain medical records for a statutory period of seven years after the conclusion of treatment.</p>

<p>We will then contact Equifax on your behalf to stop any future mailings being sent to you by Vision Express in this way.</p>
<p>If you wish to stop prospective mail from all companies, not just Vision Express, we advise you to join the MPS (<a href="http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/mpsr/" target="_blank">Mail Preference Service</a>) register.
