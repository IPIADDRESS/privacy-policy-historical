<b>GENERAL</b>
<br><br>
This policy statement provides information on the obligations and policies of Visual Paradigm (the "Organisation") under the Hong Kong SAR Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance 1995 - Cap.486 (the "Ordinance").

<br><br>

<b>OUR ORGANIZATION POLICY</b>

The Organisation shall at all times fully comply with the obligations and requirements of the Ordinance. The Organization shall try to ensure all collection and/or storage and/or transmission and/or usage of personal data by the Organization shall be done in accordance with the obligations and requirements of the Ordinance.
<br><br>
Where an individual legitimately requests access to and/or correction of personal data relating to the individual, held by the Organization, then the Organization shall provide and/or correct that data in accordance with the times and manner stipulated within the Ordinance.
<br><br>

<b>STATEMENT OF PRACTICES</b>
<br><br>

The Organization's web servers may also collect data relating to your online session, the use of which is to provide aggregated, anonymous, statistical information on the server's usage so that we may better meet the demands and expectations of visitors to our sites. This type of data may include, but is not limited to:
<br><br><ol>
<li>The browser type and version; <br>
</li><li>Operating system; and <br>
</li><li>The IP address and/or domain name.
</li></ol>
The Organization's web site may place a "cookie" on your machine or read it if you has visited the sites previously; for example to maintain your identity across multiple pages within single session. This information may include, but is not limited to, relevant login and authentication details as well as information relating to your activities and preferences without our web site.
<br><br>

<b>Accuracy of Personal Data</b>
<br><br>
Although we do not currently provide online access to and correction of personal data held by the Company, we fully comply with the "Rights of Access and Correction" obligations of the Ordinance. Please refer to the section titled "Access and Correction of Personal Data " below for details on how you can obtain and correct any personal data relating to you that we may hold.
<br><br>

<b>Retention of Personal Data</b>
<br><br>
The Organization will destroy any personal data it may hold in accordance with our internal retention policy. The policy states that:
<br><br><ol>
<li>Personal data will only be retained for as long as is necessary to fulfill the original or directly related purpose for which it was collected, unless the personal data is also retained to satisfy any applicable statutory or contractual obligations; and <br>
</li><li>Personal data are purged from the Organization's electronic, manual, and other filing systems in accordance with specific schedules based on the above criteria and the Company's internal procedures.
</li></ol>

<li>Any person or company who is acting for or on behalf of the Organization, or jointly with the Organization, in respect of the purpose or a directly related purpose for which the data was provided; and<br>
</li><li>Any other person or company who is under a duty of confidentiality to the Organization and has undertaken to keep such information confidential, provided such person or company has a legitimate right to such information.
</li></ol>
Personal data may also be disclosed to any person or persons that have a right under the Ordinance to gain access to such information provided they are able to prove their authority to access such information.
<br><br>

<b>Transfer of Personal Data Outside of Hong Kong</b>

Under the terms of the Ordinance, individuals have the right to:
<br><br><ol>
<li>Check whether the Organization holds any personal data relating to them and, if so, obtain copies of such data; <br>
              </li><li>Require the Organization to correct any personal data relating 
                to them which is inaccurate for the purpose for which it is being
