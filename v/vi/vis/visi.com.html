    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

    <p>Effective January 14, 2003</p>

    <p><b>1. &nbsp; General Information.</b> &nbsp; Vector Internet
    Services, Inc. ("VISI") understands the importance of your
    privacy. At VISI we are committed to protecting the privacy of
    information collected from visitors to our Website(s) (referred
    to in this statement as the "Site"), and from customers of all
    of VISI's services (collectively referred to in this statement
    as the "Services"). This Privacy Statement discloses how we
    collect and use information regarding the visitors to the Site
    and customers of the Services (referred to in this statement as
    "Users"), and the choices that Users can make about the way
    their information is collected and used. By registering and/or
    using the Services provided on the Site, you acknowledge and
    agree to the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy
    Statement and any terms and conditions applicable to any of the
    specific Services that you have registered to receive. If you
    do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, do not
    continue to visit the Site or use any of the Services.</p>

    <p><b>2. &nbsp; VISI's Collection And Use Of User
    Information.</b> &nbsp; VISI collects and uses personally
    identifiable information (PII), Users' Website activity
    information (through the use of "cookies"), IP addresses,
    Users' demographic information and information supplied by
    third parties.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><b>a. &nbsp; Personally Identifiable Information.</b>
      &nbsp; VISI collects personally identifiable information
      (PII) from Users such as the User's name, address, telephone
      number, gender, birth date, e-mail address, social security
      number, credit or debit card numbers. VISI uses the User's
      PII to help customize and enrich the User's experience with
      the Site or Services by allowing VISI to send information to
      the User about the User's account, VISI's services,
      advertisements for products and services of third parties
      that may be of interest to User, and other information that
      reflect the User's interests ("Provider Notices"). VISI takes
      reasonable steps to keep all PII it collects from Users
      confidential within VISI and, except as described in this
      Privacy Statement, will not sell, rent, or intentionally
      disclose a User's PII to anyone else without first providing
      the User with notice of such use and an opportunity to
      opt-out of such use.</p>

      <p><b>b. &nbsp; Cookies.</b> &nbsp; VISI uses cookies to keep
      and occasionally track information about User and the User's
      visits to the Site. A cookie is a small piece of data that is
      sent to User's computer browser from a Web server and stored
      on User's computer hard drive. The cookie is then read by the
      Web server programs to inform a Website operator (like VISI)
      if User has previously visited that site. VISI uses cookies
      to improve and personalize the User's visit to the Site and
      current or future use of the Services. VISI's use of cookies
      may include delivery of content specific to the User's
      interests, saving User's password so User does not have to
      re-enter it each time User visits the Site or uses the
      Services, and studying traffic patterns and taking other
      actions to improve the Site or the Services. The information
      collected by VISI by use of cookies is only used within VISI
      and, except as described in this Privacy Statement, will not
      be sold, rented, or disclosed to anyone else without User's
      prior notification or consent.</p>

      <p>Through the Site and the Services, VISI provides Users
      with unfiltered access to information available via hypertext
      links (the "Links") to other parties' Websites. Personally
      identifying information may be gathered from the Websites
      referenced by the Links. In most cases, VISI does not hold
      any rights to the Websites referenced by the Links, and has
      no association with their endorsers or control over their
      content or practices.</p>

      <p>VISI WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OR DISCLOSURE OF
      ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE OR OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED
      VIA THIRD PARTY USE OF COOKIES, THE LINKS, OR OTHERWISE BY
      ANY THIRD PARTY.</p>

      <p><b>c. &nbsp; IP Addresses.</b> &nbsp; An Internet protocol
      ("IP") address is a set of numbers that is automatically
      assigned to User's computer when a User accesses the
      Internet. Web servers identify User's computer by the IP
      address assigned to it during User's online session. VISI
      collects the IP address of User's when they visit the Site
      and uses User's IP address to help diagnose problems with
      VISI's servers and to administer the Site and VISI's Web
      pages. In addition, VISI may use IP addresses for other
      purposes, for example, to report anonymous User information
      to current or potential advertisers, or to gather information
      for aggregate use. VISI does not ordinarily link a User's IP
      address to the User's name or other PII, but reserves the
      right to do so for use only within VISI.</p>

      <p><b>d. &nbsp; Demographic Information.</b> &nbsp; VISI
      collects non-identifying demographic information, such as the
      Users' zip code, age and income level, and uses such
      information to tailor the Users' experience with the Site and
      Services. For example, VISI may use demographic information
      to display content according to the User's preferences. User
      demographic information may be shared with business partners
      and advertisers on an aggregate basis in a manner which will
      not personally identify the User submitting such
      information.</p>

      <p><b>e. &nbsp; Third Party Information.</b> &nbsp; VISI may
      supplement the information that User provides with
      information that is received from third parties. The type of
      information that may be received could include PII and User
      demographic information. The use of this information provided
      to VISI by third parties will be governed and restricted only
      by the terms and conditions imposed by those third
      parties.</p>

      <p><b>f. &nbsp; Exceptions.</b> &nbsp; In addition to the
      uses and disclosures described above, VISI may disclose
      Users' information, including PII, in special cases,
      including but not limited to: (1) when VISI has reason to
      believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
      enforce compliance with the terms and conditions of our Site
      or Services or otherwise in order to enforce VISI's rights
      with regard to the User; (2) to identify, contact or bring
      legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or
      interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally)
      the Site, the Services, VISI' rights or property, other Users
      of the Site, or anyone else; (3) VISI believes in good faith
      that any law enforcement agency or applicable law, rule,
      regulation, subpoena or order requires the disclosure; or (4)
      to third parties providing services to VISI, provided that
      such third parties agree to use and disclose the information
      shared only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy

    <p><b>3. &nbsp; Correcting Or Updating Disclosed Information,

    collected, request corrections or updates to User's
    information, stop VISI's sending of announcements and
    advertisements about the Services and modify or rescind User's
    authorization to disclose PII to third parties (except as set

    <p><b>4. &nbsp; Data Security.</b> &nbsp; VISI takes reasonable
    precautions to prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure or
    access to User's information. Certain VISI User Service
    accounts are password-protected, providing persons who have
    access to a User's password with access to the Services under
    the User's account and the User's account-related information.
    If User refrains from sharing User's password with others and
    protects it from disclosure, User helps to maintain security
    and confidentiality of User's account and account related
    information. User must remember to log out of User's VISI
    account when User is finished using the Site or the Services.
    By doing so, User protects User's account from being re-opened
    by another person. If the confidentiality of a User's password
    has been compromised, the User should contact VISI to receive a
    new password. Please note that despite its efforts to maintain
    the security and confidentiality, neither VISI nor any other
    Internet service can promise complete security against
    unauthorized access to, use of and disclosure of User
    information provided over the Internet.</p>

    <p><b>5. &nbsp; Age Requirement.</b> &nbsp; VISI encourages
    parents and guardians to be familiar with the Websites that
    their children visit and the Services that they use. The
    Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") regulates how Website
    operators collect and use personal information from children
    under the age of 13, pursuant to the Children's Online Privacy
    Protection Act of 1998 (the "Act"). For more information about
    the Act and children's on-line privacy in general, visit the
    FTC's Website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">http://www.ftc.gov/</a>. VISI requires
    that all Users be at least 18 years of age. To the extent that
    some of the Services and the Site become accessible to a child
    under the age of 13 (by any means including, a Users'
    intentional or inadvertent disclosure of its password to that
    child), VISI requests that the child under the age of 13
    refrain from using the Site and Services. Users under the age
    of 13 are prohibited from posting or transmitting any PII or
    other information on the Site, the Services, or any other VISI
    Website. VISI relies in part on its Users to prevent
    unauthorized access to the Site and the Services, and to comply
    with the provisions of this statement.</p>
