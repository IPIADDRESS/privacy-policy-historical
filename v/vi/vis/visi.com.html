In addition, if TDS sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, TDS may transfer your Confidential Personal Information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.<br><br>California Privacy Rights<br><br>A business subject to California Civil Code section 1798.83 is required to disclose to its customers, upon request, the identity of any Third Parties to whom the business has disclosed “personal information” regarding that customer within the immediately preceding calendar year.<br><br>If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:<br><br>TDS Telecom<br><br>Attention: Legal Dept. 525 Junction Road<br>Madison, WI 53717<br><br>Please note that California businesses are only required to respond to a customer request once during the course of any calendar year.<br><br>*Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”)<br><br>CPNI refers to and includes information that we have about you by virtue of our relationship with you as your service provider. This includes information about your account usage – such as the type and quantity of the services you subscribe to and other details about your calling including the date, time, call-to location, number called or number the call was received from, and minutes and charges of the call. Use of CPNI is subject to federal laws and regulations with which TDS is required to comply.<br><br>We use CPNI to help us service your account when you call us with questions, to guard against fraudulent use of our network, to provision our services, or to generate and collect your bill. The CPNI rules recognize the value of our use of this information to serve you and permit our use of your information provided we safeguard it from unauthorized disclosure. We want to assure all of our customers that we have practices and procedures in place to help ensure your Confidential Personal Information is safe.<br><br>TDS is prohibited from allowing our Affiliates or agents from using this information without your permission for marketing TDS’s or its Affiliates products and services to you. Your permission allows them to use this information to assist you with your needs.<br><br>When you become a customer of TDS and no later than every two years thereafter, we will send you a notice in the mail explaining your rights concerning Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI Notice”). You can expect to receive the CPNI Notice in your bill (or by a separate mailing if you are enrolled in TDS ePay). It is important that you contact us as described in this notice if you do not wish to grant permission to use your CPNI to market new products and services to you. The law permits us to infer your permission if you do not tell us otherwise. Access or Disclosure of CPNI<br><br>There may be instances when TDS may access or disclose CPNI without notice or your consent in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of TDS, our Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of customers or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process such as a subpoena. In addition, if TDS sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, TDS may transfer your CPNI to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.<br><br>*Note this section applicable to TDS Telecom customers only<br><br>For additional information about the FCC’s rules pertaining to CPNI follow this link http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/phoneaboutyou.html.<br><br>Accessing your Confidential Personal Information<br><br>TDS takes reasonable measures to assure that the Confidential Personal Information we use about you is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. We make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Confidential Personal Information either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.<br><br>Customers who wish to review and/or edit their Confidential Personal Information may do so by contacting us at the number provided on their billing statement.<br><br>We may decline to process requests for information that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.<br><br>TDS provides customers with the ability to authorize individuals (“Authorized User”) to make inquiries, limited changes, or both, in order to maintain their account. Customers may specify the type of information and changes that the Authorized User is approved to request. This includes access to call detail. An Authorized User cannot change the customer’s Confidential Personal Information. Customers may add or remove an Authorized User from their account at any time.<br><br>We ask customers and their Authorized Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests. If you or your Authorized User contacts us via phone, you will be asked to provide your name, the account Personal Identification Number (“PIN”) (if the account is PIN protected; otherwise you will be asked to provide other information for the purposes of identity verification), and the billing address zip code before we are able to assist you. You or your Authorized user will be asked to present a valid photo ID when requesting account information while at a business office.<br><br>Communication Preferences<br><br>If you do not want TDS to use your Confidential Personal Information to contact you for marketing or solicitation purposes (excluding notices about your existing account), TDS Telecom customers may make this request to webcontact@tdstelecom.com , and TDS HMS customers may make this request to events@visi.com. Both TDS Telecom and TDS HMS customers may also make this request to TDS Telecom, Attn: Legal Dept,525 Junction Road, Madison, Wisconsin 53717.<br><br>When writing to us, please specify which contact methods (phone calls, mail, bill inserts, or email messages) you would prefer that we do not use to communicate to you for the purposes outlined above. Keep in mind that restricting contact methods may make it more difficult for us to keep you informed about new products and services that can be of benefit to you. You can revoke these options at any time by contacting us using one of the methods provided.<br><br>These choices do not apply to the display of online advertising or the receipt of mandatory service communications that are considered part of certain TDS services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the service.<br><br>If you request to not be contacted by phone for marketing or sales purposes, please note that the TDS Do Not Call List restricts these types of phone contacts from TDS only, so you may continue to receive calls from other companies. If you would like to add your number to the National Do Not Call List, you may do so by calling 1-888-382-1222 or going online at www.donotcall.gov.<br><br>Controlling Unsolicited Email (“Spam”)<br><br>TDS is concerned about controlling unsolicited email or “spam.” While TDS and its vendors continue to actively review and implement new technology to help prevent this activity, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited email. Using junk email tools and being cautious about the sharing of your email address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited email you receive. For more information about this and other related topics go to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.onguardonline.gov.<br><br>Security of your Confidential Personal Information<br><br>TDS takes reasonable security safeguards to protect against such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure of Confidential Personal Information.<br><br>We restrict access to Confidential Personal Information to TDS employees, employees of our Affiliates, and authorized Third Parties who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.<br><br>We protect the security of your Confidential Personal Information transmitted through our Web sites by using software which encrypts the Confidential Personal Information you input or view.<br><br>Customers should not provide their account information or pin to anyone other than Authorized Users on their account. Customers are encouraged to protect their computer and passwords against unauthorized access. When accessing information online, customers should sign off when finished using a shared computer and always log out of any Web site after viewing Confidential Personal Information.<br><br>We will not store Confidential Personal Information beyond what is necessary for business purposes, including for internal service evaluation and quality assurance purposes, except as otherwise required by law.<br><br>Enforcement of this Privacy Statement<br><br>Our employees, agents, and Affiliates are trained regarding their responsibilities to safeguard your privacy. They are required to adhere to a Code of Business Conduct, this Privacy Statement, and TDS’s policies which support our commitment to protecting customer privacy. Failure to comply with the Code, this Privacy Statement, or TDS’s policies may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.<br><br>If employees or Third Parties become aware of practices that raise privacy concerns, they are required to report them to their supervisors or to contact TDS’s Incident Response Team.<br><br>Changes to this Privacy Statement<br><br>We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this Privacy Statement, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this Privacy Statement. If there are material changes to this Privacy Statement or in how TDS will use your Confidential Personal Information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes 30 days prior to implementing the change or we may make reasonable attempts to notify you directly. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to be kept informed about TDS’s privacy practices.<br><br>Contacting Us<br><br>TDS welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Statement. If you have questions about this Privacy Statement or believe that we have not adhered to it, please contact us by writing to us at the following address:<br><br>TDS Telecom<br><br>Attn: Legal Dept.<br>525 Junction Road<br>Madison, WI 53717</p>
