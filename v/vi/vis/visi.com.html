<p><strong>Summary of Our Commitment to Protecting Customer Privacy&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TDS HMS is dedicated to providing superior customer satisfaction and to safeguarding personal information about our clients and employees.<span>&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we collect Confidential Personal Information about you, we will inform you in clear and conspicuous language of the purpose for which we are collecting and/or using the information, any third-parties to whom we will disclose the information, the choices you have regarding limiting the use and disclosure of your information, and how you may contact TDS HMS to review, correct, or dispute this information.<span>&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will use your Confidential Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which we collected it from you or which you subsequently authorized, and we will provide you with notice before we use or disclose your information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.<span>&nbsp; </span>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that all Confidential Personal Information we collect, retain, or use is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.<span>&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we host data for customers, we start with two simple principles:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We use, disclose, and otherwise process personal data only to provide the services requested by our customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>We maintain robust security to protect it against unauthorized acquisition or use.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>TDS HMS’s obligations with respect to personal data for which TDS HMS is a data processor, such as data that TDS HMS hosts for its customers, are further defined in TDS HMS’s agreements with its customers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Personal information obtained from our clients is processed in compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in our client contracts and correspondence and our professional standards. &nbsp;</p>
<p>TDS HMS recognizes that its commercial customers may also be subject to detailed privacy and information security regulations as a financial institution under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act or as a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can readily accommodate legal requirements to ensure appropriate privacy controls, and we enter into additional agreements, such as Business Associate Agreements, when required by applicable law. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Safe Harbor Compliance</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Business with personal data originating in the European Union should rest assured that TDS HMS complies with the data protection requirements applicable to it. </span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use of your Confidential Personal Information/ Data Integrity&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will use your Confidential Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which we collected it from you or which you subsequently authorized. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that all Confidential Personal Information we collect, retain, or use is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.<span>&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may use your Confidential Personal Information to provide you with and manage the services you request, communicate with you to maintain customer relations or to suggest new products and services that may be of interest to you, personalize the content we deliver, conduct industry or consumer surveys, manage, improve and troubleshoot our network and services, enforce our Terms of Service, or for any purpose otherwise permitted or required by law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you want to set up an account with TDS HMS, in order to determine your credit worthiness, we may use some of your Confidential Personal Information to request a credit report from a credit-reporting agency based on a permissible purpose consistent with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TDS HMS uses the information collected on its Web sites to provide you with the information you requested. When you use our Web sites to order products or services, or to request information about them, we may use the information we have about you as we would use the same information obtained offline - for example, to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. You may also submit applications for employment online, and we will use the information you provide to consider you for employment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will not use your Confidential Personal Information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized without your consent.<span>&nbsp; </span>We will not use sensitive personal information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized unless you have provided your affirmative and express (opt-in) consent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you provide us with your Confidential Personal Information, we collect that certain purposes that are required or permitted by applicable law, and TDS HMS may access or disclose Confidential Personal Information without further notice or your consent in order to: (i) investigate, protect or defend the legal rights or property of TDS, TDS HMS, our Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of customers or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process such as a subpoena.<span>&nbsp; </span>TDS HMS will provide its customers with prompt notice of law enforcement requests or demands for their data to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law so that the customer may assert any defenses or other legal interests that it wishes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If TDS or TDS HMS sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger, transfer, or liquidation of all or a material part of its business, your Confidential Personal Information may be transferred to the party or parties involved in the transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we obtain Confidential Personal Information from a Third Party, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Collection and Use of Children's Confidential Personal Information&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TDS HMS sites and services are intended for adults. In order to respect the privacy of children online, TDS HMS does not knowingly collect, maintain or process Confidential Personal Information submitted by children under the age of 13, and we will promptly delete any such information when we become aware that it was collected inadvertently.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we do collect age information, and users identify themselves as under the age of 13, the site will block such users from providing Confidential Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sharing of your Confidential Personal Information / Onward Transfer&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will not disclose your Confidential Personal Information without your consent outside of TDS, TDS HMS, its Affiliates, or its authorized agents, such as service providers who help initiate, render, bill and collect for our products and services, other than as described in this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No data that we host or process for our clients is used for our marketing purposes or the marketing purposes of any other party.<span>&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will not share or sell any Confidential Personal Information collected through the TDS HMS with any external parties without your consent.<span>&nbsp; </span>Confidential Personal Information that we collect from you may be shared with Affiliates and Third Parties with consent for the purposes of marketing our products and services. Depending on the circumstance, notice and opt-out may be a permissible means of obtaining your consent.<span>&nbsp; </span>TDS HMS may sell your Confidential Personal Information to Third Parties in order to enforce our rights under the Terms of Service. For example, we may sell past-due accounts receivable in an effort to collect for unpaid services. TDS HMS will obtain written assurances from its agents that they will safeguard Confidential Personal Information consistently with this Statement. Affiliates and Third Parties are permitted to obtain only the Confidential Personal Information they need and are prohibited from using it for any purpose other than those permitted by law or with your consent. When we use service providers to assist us in processing your Confidential Personal Information, we require that they comply with this Privacy Statement and maintain appropriate privacy and security measures.<span>&nbsp; </span>Where we have knowledge that a Third Party is using or disclosing<span>&nbsp; </span>Confidential Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Statement, TDS HMS will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accessing your Confidential Personal Information&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TDS HMS takes reasonable measures to assure that the Confidential Personal Information we use about you is reliable, accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Customers who wish to review and/or edit their Confidential Personal Information may do so by contacting us using the information listed at the end of this statement We will make reasonable good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Confidential Personal Information upon request either to correct or amend this data if it is inaccurate or incomplete or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may decline to process requests for information that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TDS HMS provides customers with the ability to authorize individuals ("Authorized User") to make inquiries, limited changes, or both, in order to maintain their account. Customers may specify the type of information and changes that the Authorized User is approved to request. Customers may add or remove an Authorized User from their account at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ask customers and their Authorized Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests. If you or your Authorized User contacts us via phone, you will be asked to provide your name, the account Personal Identification Number ("PIN") (if the account is PIN protected; otherwise you will be asked to provide other information for the purposes of identity verification), and the billing address ZIP code before we are able to assist you. You or your Authorized user will be asked to present a valid photo ID when requesting account information while at a business office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Communication Preferences&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not want TDS HMS to use your Confidential Personal Information to contact you for marketing or solicitation purposes (excluding notices about your existing account), TDS HMS customers may make this request to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@tdshms.com"><font color="#0000ff">privacy@tdshms.com</font></a>. <span>&nbsp;</span>When writing to us, please specify which contact methods (phone calls, mail, bill inserts, or email messages) you would prefer that we do not use to communicate to you for the purposes outlined above. Keep in mind that restricting contact methods may make it more difficult for us to keep you informed about new products and services that can be of benefit to you. You can revoke these options at any time by contacting us using one of the methods provided in this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These choices do not apply to the display of online advertising or the receipt of transactional and service communications that are considered part of certain TDS HMS services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you request to not be contacted by phone for marketing or sales purposes, please note that the TDS Do Not Call List restricts these types of phone contacts from TDS only, so you may continue to receive calls from other companies. If you would like to add your number to the National Do Not Call List, you may do so by calling 1-888-382-1222 or visiting&nbsp;<a href="http://www.donotcall.gov/"><font color="#0000ff">www.donotcall.gov</font></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Controlling Unsolicited Email ("Spam")&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TDS HMS is concerned about controlling unsolicited email or "spam." While TDS HMS and its vendors continue to actively review and implement new technology to help prevent this activity, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited email. Using junk email tools and being cautious about the sharing of your email address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited email you receive. For more information about this and other related topics go to the Federal Trade Commission's website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.onguardonline.gov/" target="new"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.onguardonline.gov</font></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We restrict access to Confidential Personal Information to TDS HMS employees, employees of our Affiliates, and authorized Third Parties who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will not store Confidential Personal Information beyond what is necessary for business purposes, including for internal service evaluation and quality assurance purposes, except as otherwise required by law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
