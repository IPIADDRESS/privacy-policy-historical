<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>Effective January 14, 2003</p>

<p><b>1. &nbsp; General Information.</b> &nbsp;
  Vector Internet Services, Inc. ("VISI") understands the importance of
your privacy.  At VISI we are committed to protecting the privacy of
information collected from visitors to our Website(s) (referred to in
this statement as the "Site"), and from customers of all of VISI's
services (collectively referred to in this statement as the
"Services").  This Privacy Statement discloses how we collect and use
information regarding the visitors to the Site and customers of the
Services (referred to in this statement as "Users"), and the choices
that Users can make about the way their information is collected and
used.  By registering and/or using the Services provided on the Site,
you acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions contained in this
Privacy Statement and any terms and conditions applicable to any of the
specific Services that you have registered to receive.  If you do not
agree to all of these terms and conditions, do not continue to visit
the Site or use any of the Services.</p>

<p><b>2. &nbsp; VISI's Collection And Use Of User Information.</b> &nbsp;
  VISI collects and uses personally identifiable information (PII),
Users' Website activity information (through the use of "cookies"), IP
addresses, Users' demographic information and information supplied by
third parties.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>a. &nbsp; Personally Identifiable Information.</b> &nbsp;
    VISI collects personally identifiable information (PII) from Users
  such as the User's name, address, telephone number, gender, birth
  date, e-mail address, social security number, credit or debit card
  numbers.  VISI uses the User's PII to help customize and enrich the
  User's experience with the Site or Services by allowing VISI to send
  information to the User about the User's account, VISI's services,
  advertisements for products and services of third parties that may be
  of interest to User, and other information that reflect the User's
  interests ("Provider Notices").  VISI takes reasonable steps to keep
  all PII it collects from Users confidential within VISI and, except
  as described in this Privacy Statement, will not sell, rent, or
  intentionally disclose a User's PII to anyone else without first
  providing the User with notice of such use and an opportunity to
  opt-out of such use.</p>

  <p><b>b. &nbsp; Cookies.</b> &nbsp;
    VISI uses cookies to keep and occasionally track information about
  User and the User's visits to the Site.  A cookie is a small piece of
  data that is sent to User's computer browser from a Web server and
  stored on User's computer hard drive.  The cookie is then read by the
  Web server programs to inform a Website operator (like VISI) if User
  has previously visited that site.  VISI uses cookies to improve and
  personalize the User's visit to the Site and current or future use of
  the Services.  VISI's use of cookies may include delivery of content
  specific to the User's interests, saving User's password so User does
  not have to re-enter it each time User visits the Site or uses the
  Services, and studying traffic patterns and taking other actions to
  improve the Site or the Services.  The information collected by VISI
  by use of cookies is only used within VISI and, except as described
  in this Privacy Statement, will not be sold, rented, or disclosed to
  anyone else without User's prior notification or consent.</p>

  <p>Through the Site and the Services, VISI provides Users with
  unfiltered access to information available via hypertext links (the
  "Links") to other parties' Websites.  Personally identifying
  information may be gathered from the Websites referenced by the
  Links.  In most cases, VISI does not hold any rights to the Websites
  referenced by the Links, and has no association with their endorsers
  or control over their content or practices.</p>

    <p>VISI WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OR DISCLOSURE OF ANY
    PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE OR OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA THIRD
    PARTY USE OF COOKIES, THE LINKS, OR OTHERWISE BY ANY THIRD PARTY.</p>

  <p><b>c. &nbsp; IP Addresses.</b> &nbsp;
    An Internet protocol ("IP") address is a set of numbers that is
  automatically assigned to User's computer when a User accesses the
  Internet.  Web servers identify User's computer by the IP address
  assigned to it during User's online session.  VISI collects the IP
  address of User's when they visit the Site and uses User's IP address
  to help diagnose problems with VISI's servers and to administer the
  Site and VISI's Web pages.  In addition, VISI may use IP addresses
  for other purposes, for example, to report anonymous User information
  to current or potential advertisers, or to gather information for
  aggregate use.  VISI does not ordinarily link a User's IP address to
  the User's name or other PII, but reserves the right to do so for use
  only within VISI.</p>

  <p><b>d. &nbsp; Demographic Information.</b> &nbsp;
    VISI collects non-identifying demographic information, such as the
  Users' zip code, age and income level, and uses such information to
  tailor the Users' experience with the Site and Services.  For
  example, VISI may use demographic information to display content
  according to the User's preferences.  User demographic information
  may be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate
  basis in a manner which will not personally identify the User
  submitting such information.</p>

  <p><b>e. &nbsp; Third Party Information.</b> &nbsp;
    VISI may supplement the information that User provides with
  information that is received from third parties.  The type of
  information that may be received could include PII and User
  demographic information.  The use of this information provided to
  VISI by third parties will be governed and restricted only by the
  terms and conditions imposed by those third parties.</p>

  <p><b>f. &nbsp; Exceptions.</b> &nbsp;
    In addition to the uses and disclosures described above, VISI may
  disclose Users' information, including PII, in special cases,
  including but not limited to: (1) when VISI has reason to believe
  that disclosing this information is necessary to enforce compliance
  with the terms and conditions of our Site or Services or otherwise in
  order to enforce VISI's rights with regard to the User; (2) to
  identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
  causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
  unintentionally) the Site, the Services, VISI' rights or property,
  other Users of the Site, or anyone else; (3) VISI believes in good
  faith that any law enforcement agency or applicable law, rule,
  regulation, subpoena or order requires the disclosure; or (4) to
  third parties providing services to VISI, provided that such third
  parties agree to use and disclose the information shared only in
  accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>3. &nbsp; Correcting Or Updating Disclosed Information, Changing
Elections, Or Stopping The Further Collection And/Or Use Of User's
Information.</b> &nbsp;
  Users may access the data collected, request corrections or updates
to User's information, stop VISI's sending of announcements and
advertisements about the Services and modify or rescind User's
authorization to disclose PII to third parties (except as set forth in
Section 2(f), by sending a request as specified below.  VISI will
correct such error, make such an update and/or stop sending
announcements and advertisements and/or stop disclosing such
information, upon: (a) receipt of a written request to do so; (b)
verifying the existence of the alleged error (if applicable); and (c)
verifying the identity of the User requesting the change.</p>

  <p>Users may request all changes by either: (a)  sending an e-mail
  request to:
    <a href="mailto:privacy@visi.com">privacy@visi.com</a>
  or (b) sending a letter via the U.S. Mail to:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>VISI.com</b><br>
    12 S. 6th St., Suite 630<br>
    Minneapolis, MN 55402</p>
  </blockquote>

<p><b>4. &nbsp; Data Security.</b> &nbsp;
  VISI takes reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized use,
disclosure or access to User's information.  The precautions include

    [insert standard security precautions used to protect all
    information during and after collection].

Certain VISI User Service accounts are password-protected, providing
persons who have access to a User's password with access to the
Services under the User's account and the User's account-related
information.  If User refrains from sharing User's password with others
and protects it from disclosure, User helps to maintain security and
confidentiality of User's account and account related information. 
User must remember to log out of User's VISI account when User is
finished using the Site or the Services.  By doing so, User protects
User's account from being re-opened by another person.  If the
confidentiality of a User's password has been compromised, the User
should contact VISI to receive a new password.  Please note that
despite its efforts to maintain the security and confidentiality,
neither VISI nor any other Internet service can promise complete
security against unauthorized access to, use of and disclosure of User
information provided over the Internet.</p>

<p><b>5. &nbsp; Age Requirement.</b> &nbsp;
  VISI encourages parents and guardians to be familiar with the
Websites that their children visit and the Services that they use.  The
Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") regulates how Website operators
collect and use personal information from children under the age of 13,
pursuant to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (the
"Act").  For more information about the Act and children's on-line
privacy in general, visit the FTC's Website at
  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">http://www.ftc.gov/</a>.
VISI requires that all Users be at least 18 years of age.  To the
extent that some of the Services and the Site become accessible to a
child under the age of 13 (by any means including, a Users' intentional
or inadvertent disclosure of its password to that child), VISI requests
that the child under the age of 13 refrain from using the Site and
Services.  Users under the age of 13 are prohibited from posting or
transmitting any PII or other information on the Site, the Services, or
any other VISI Website.  VISI relies in part on its Users to prevent
unauthorized access to the Site and the Services, and to comply with
the provisions of this statement.</p>

<p><b>6. &nbsp; Miscellaneous.</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>a. &nbsp; Limitation of Liability.</b> &nbsp;
    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW VISI DISCLAIMS
  ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE OF
  USER'S INFORMATION PROVIDED VIA THE SITE OR ANY OTHER DIRECT,
  INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT
  OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO SUCH INFORMATION EVEN IF VISI HAS BEEN
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL
  LIMIT VISI'S LIABILITY FOR ITS OWN WILLFUL, WANTON OR INTENTIONAL
  TORTS.</p>

  <p><b>b. &nbsp; Governing Law.</b> &nbsp;
    This Privacy Statement will in all respects be governed by and
  interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
  the United States and the State of Minnesota, except for its conflict
  of laws provisions.  Any action arising out of or relating to this
  Privacy Statement will be exclusively venued in a state or federal
  court situated within the State of Minnesota.  User irrevocably
  consents and submits to the personal jurisdiction of said courts for
  all such purposes.</p>

  <p><b>c. &nbsp; Revisions.</b> &nbsp;
    VISI reserves the right to change, modify and or remove portions of
  these terms and conditions at any time.  The terms and conditions
  applicable to your collected information shall be: (i) in the case of
  PII collected by VISI, the terms and conditions in place at the time
  you submitted the applicable information; and (ii) in the case of
  cookies and IP addresses, the terms and conditions in effect upon the
  User's last visit to the Site that results in the delivery of or
  access to such cookies, or the collection of such IP addresses.</p>

  <p><b>d. &nbsp; Entire Agreement.</b> &nbsp;
    This Privacy Statement contains the entire agreement between VISI
  and User regarding VISI's collection and use of information from User
  and supersedes any prior representations, advertisements, statements,
  proposals, negotiations, discussions, understandings, or agreements
  regarding the same subject matter.  User acknowledges that it has not
  been induced to agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement by any
  representations or statements, oral or written, not expressly
  contained in this Privacy Statement.</p>
