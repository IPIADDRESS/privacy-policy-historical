		<p>Your personal information will not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area without your express consent.</p>

		<p>Unless we are required to do so by law or to enforce our terms and conditions of use, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our customers or others we will not disclose, sell or distribute your information to any third party without your permission.</p>
