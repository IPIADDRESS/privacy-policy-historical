<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We process personal information for the purposes of providing our Services for the benefit of and on behalf of our Clients. &nbsp;Our Services involve analysing the above information to create a picture of your lifestyle, interests and browsing and shopping intent as well as tastes and preferences. &nbsp;Although most of the information we collect cannot identify you (unless you choose to provide information such as your name, address or email address) it enables us to create groups of users with similar browsing, interest or behaviour patterns, depending on our Clients’ specifications. &nbsp;We call these groups Audience Groups. &nbsp;The Audience Groups can then be used to provide you with content and adverts that are more relevant to your lifestyle and interests. &nbsp;We also use cookie and Clickstream data collected from various websites that are part of our network to provide targeted advertising services and to profile users across our network.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">The information may also be used for analytical and strategic development purposes, to measure the effectiveness of content and adverts and to provide you with a more personalised service on both our Site and our Clients’ websites.</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sharing information</div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We will only share your name, contact details and other information which can directly identify you, with our Clients if you have provided your express consent. &nbsp;We may share other information, such as your responses to Quizzes as part of our Services to enable our Clients to design or improve their services and products and for other marketing purposes.</div>
