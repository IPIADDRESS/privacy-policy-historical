<p>
    The Visual Web Ripper web site is owned and operated by Sequentum Pty Limited. Sequentum&nbsp;is committed to honouring privacy rights.
</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: BY USING THIS&nbsp;WEB SITE YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT 
	ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY Sequentum FOR THE 
	PURPOSES DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING&nbsp;WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
<p>This privacy policy describes Sequentum's current policies and 
	practices with regard to personal data collected by Sequentum through this web 
	site.&nbsp; The term "personal data" refers to personally identifiable 
	information about you, such as your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing 
	address.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes to This Policy</strong></p>
<p>Sequentum is continually improving and adding new functionality and 
	features to this web site and improving and adding to its existing products, 
	services and programs.&nbsp; Because of these ongoing changes, changes in the 
	law and the changing nature of technology, Sequentum's data practices will 
	change from time to time.&nbsp; If and when our data practices change, 
	Sequentum will post the changes on our web site to notify you of the 
	changes.&nbsp; We encourage you to check this page frequently.&nbsp; Please 
	rest assured, however, that it is always our intent to comply with the letter 
	and spirit of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p><strong>Information Gathering and Dissemination Practices</strong></p>
<p>
	Our site's registration forms require customers and prospective customers 
	(together called "customers") to give us personal data.&nbsp; Periodically, we 
	use the information you have provided on the registration form to send you 
	updates about our products and promotional material provided to us by our

	periodically about the products and services for which the customer has signed 
	up, as well as general information about Sequentum. &nbsp;In these mailings, we 
	may include offers from our partners, information about product upgrades and 
	enhancements, as well as marketing promotions from Sequentum.</p>
<p>Anonymous Data Collected Through This Web Site</p>
<p>In addition to the information you provide when you use our web 
	site, Sequentum may use technology to collect anonymous information about the 
	use of our web site.&nbsp; For example, we may use technology to track which 
	pages of our web site our visitors view.&nbsp; We also may use technology to 
	determine which web browsers our visitors use.&nbsp; This technology does not

	visitors and their use of our site.</p>
<p>We use this anonymous data to improve the content and functionality 
	of this web site and our e-mail updates, to better understand our customers and 
	markets, and to improve Sequentum products and services.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>

	paragraph, Sequentum may use temporary "cookies" that collect the first level 
	domain name of the user (for example, if your e-mail address is 
	"jsmith@email.com," the cookie collects the "email.com" portion of your e-mail 
	address) and the date and time you accessed this web site.&nbsp; Cookies by 
	themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user.&nbsp; A cookie 
	is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored on your 
	computer's hard drive. &nbsp;Cookies do not damage your computer. &nbsp;You can 
	set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.&nbsp; This enables 
	you to decide if you want to accept it or not.</p>

	parties who act for or on behalf of Sequentum, or in connection with the 
	business of Sequentum, for further processing in accordance with the purposes 
	for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which you have 
	subsequently consented.&nbsp; In addition, there may be some other, limited 
	circumstances in which Sequentum may share or transfer the information in its 
	databases, for example, to comply with a legal requirement, for the 
	administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, to protect the 
	security or integrity of our databases or this web site, to take precautions 
	against legal liability, or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, 
	reorganisation, dissolution or similar event.</p>

	comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention 
	requirements. &nbsp;Our servers and our databases are protected by industry 
	standard security technology, such as industry standard firewalls and password 
	protection.</p>
