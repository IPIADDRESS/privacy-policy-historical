			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">Webyog Softworks Private Limited is committed to protecting your privacy.   Because we collect two types of user information, General Statistical   Information and Personal Identifying Information, we are providing you with this   policy to inform you of how we use and, in limited circumstances, disclose such   information.</p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext"><strong>Collection, Use and Disclosure of General Statistical Information</strong></p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">When you visit our web site we gather certain general information, such as   frequency of downloads, number of hits on our web site, and usage statistics   with respect to our software products. This information is referred to   throughout this policy as "General Statistical Information". We use and store   this data only on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an   individual basis. This data helps us to determine how and the extent to which   certain parts of our web site and software are used. The stored General   Statistical Information does not contain any Personal Identifying Information   about you or any of our other users.</p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext"><strong>Collection and Use of Personal Identifying Information</strong></p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">In addition to collecting General Statistical Information, we may ask you to   provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, street address   and email address, to enable us to respond to your requests and needs.   Information that can reasonably be used to identify you is referred to in this   policy as "Personal Identifying Information".</p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">For example, if you choose a service or transaction that requires payment,   such as making a purchase online or through other means such as a purchase   order, we will request Personal Identifying Information necessary for payment,   invoicing, and/or shipping.</p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">  In addition, when you purchase a&nbsp;software product, we will also ask   for product registration information, which includes the name of the product   acquired, as well as your name, street address, and e-mail address. This   Personal Identifying Information is kept on file and updated from time to time   to fulfill our continuing obligations to you, such as providing notices of new   versions and giving support by e-mail.</p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">When you visit our web pages by clicking on a link   in&nbsp;our&nbsp;software and choose to purchase a license, we gather certain Personal   Identifying Information to facilitate your purchase and usage statistics to analyze, on   a collective basis, how and the extent to which certain parts of the&nbsp;our&nbsp;software&nbsp;is used.</p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">When you provide us Personal Identifying Information in an e-mail, fax or by   telephone such as when you request technical and other types of support, we use   the information to locate your records and provide you with answers to your   questions.</p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">  Also, when you submit information to us in the context of a   technical support inquiry, including sending the&nbsp;error log files, sample data to reproduce   the error, Personal Identifying Information may be attached to the information   submitted.</p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">Please note that you should be aware that the transmitting of the error logs   or sample data or other attachments may include confidential information which   should be removed prior to the transmittal as we do not accept responsibility   for the inadvertent subsequent disclosure of such confidential information. When   you ask to be placed on one of our mailing lists, we will use your e-mail   address to send you messages relevant to that list.</p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext"><strong>Disclosure of Personal Identifying Information</strong></p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">We may disclose your Personal Identifying Information to appropriate third   parties to process transactions you initiate, including shipping products to you   and invoicing for purchases made. Examples of such third parties are our order   processing and fulfillment service providers and credit card processing   companies. We may also disclose your Personal Identifying Information to third   parties if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe that such action is   necessary to:</p>
			<p align="justify" class="simpletext">1. Comply with legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court   order;<br>
