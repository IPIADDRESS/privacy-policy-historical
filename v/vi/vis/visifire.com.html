<div class="wy-top-margin wy-eula-points">7. Use of Cookies, Usage Data</div>
<p class="wy-small-top-margin wy-small-bottom-margin wy-eula-content"><strong><em>Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses</em></strong>.
The Company uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company's Websites ('Website Navigational Information'). As described more fully below, we and our partners use these cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer Websites and Services, track users' movements around our Websites and Services, serve targeted advertisements and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. This section describes the types of Website Navigational Information used on the Company's Websites and Services, and how this information may be used.
<br>
<strong><em>Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data</em></strong>.
As is true of most Company Websites, we gather certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the Company's Websites and Services. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Company's Websites and Services, we automatically receive the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave our Website.  This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve our Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide the Websites and Services. For example, the Company uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which customers and website visitors navigate the Company's Websites. The Company also collects IP addresses from customers when they log into the Services as part of the Company's 'Identity Confirmation' and 'IP Range Restrictions' security features.
<br>
<strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>
The Company uses cookies to make interactions with the Company's Websites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company's Websites, the Company's servers send a cookie to your computer or device. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to the Company, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a 'Request a Demo' or a 'Request a Quote' Web form) or have previously identified yourself to the Company, you remain anonymous to the Company. The Company uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer or device when  you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your  computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on the Company's Websites or Services.
<br>
The following sets out how the Company uses different categories of cookies.
<br>
<strong><em>Required Cookies:</em></strong>
Required cookies enable you to navigate the Company's Websites and use its features, such as accessing secure     areas of the Websites and using the Company Services. If you have chosen to identify yourself to the Company, the Company may place on your browser cookies containing an encrypted, unique identifier. These cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Company's Websites and Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Therefore, there is no option to opt out of these cookies because they are essential to operate the Websites.
<br>
<strong><em>Functionality Cookies:</em></strong>
Functionality cookies allow the Company's Websites and Services to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of the Company's Websites and Services after logging in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. Functional cookies may also be used to improve how the Company's Websites and Services function and perform, to enhance and customize your interactions with the Company, and to help us provide you with more relevant messages, including marketing communications. These cookies collect information about how website visitors use our Websites and Services, including which pages visitors go to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages. The Company may use its own technology (under the Company brand name or an affiliated brand name) or third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from website visitors, attendees, and customers, to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of the Company's advertisements. The Company and its third-party partners may also utilize HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for these purposes. Flash cookies and HTML local storage are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. The Company also uses Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on the Company Websites and Services to personalize your visit. In particular, we use Google Analytics ('Google Analytics'), a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how our websites are used, including the number of visitors, the websites from which visitors have navigated to our websites, and the pages on our websites to which visitors navigate. This information is used by us to improve the Company's Websites. To opt out from data collection by Google Analytics, you can download and install a browser add-on, which is available at <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.

Note that opting out of functional cookies may impact the functionality of our Websites and degrade your user experience.
<br>
<strong><em>Targeting or Advertising Cookies:</em></strong>
The Company sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to show you ads for the Company products and services that we think may interest you on any devices you may use and to track the performance of the Company advertisements. For example, in these cases, cookies remember information such as which browsers have visited the Company's Websites. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after the Company receives it. If the Company is using one of its own cookie- related products on our own Website, then a cookie related to ads may appear on our Website under the Company or one of our affiliated company's name. The Company also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from Web beacons (see below)  on the Company's Websites and Services, from emails, and on third-party Websites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time and across different sites or other online services by collecting Website Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use, such as a desktop or laptop computer, smartphone or tablet. Third parties use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other Websites or mobile applications on any of your devices. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Third parties, with whom the Company partners to provide certain features on our Websites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. To manage the use of targeting or advertising cookies on the Websites, consult your individual browser settings for cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118">https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118</a>. Various browsers may also offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage.
<br>
<strong><em>Do Not Track.</em></strong>
Currently, various browsers ó including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari ó offer a 'do not track' or 'DNT' option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Websites' visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. The Company does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Websites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. The Company takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
<br>
<strong><em>Usage Data.</em></strong>
As it is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically in connection with the use of the Website by individual users. This information may include IP address, device and application identification numbers, browser type, location, the pages and files viewed, operating system and system configuration information and date/time stamps associated with your  usage. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us provide and improve our Websites and to guarantee their security and continued proper functioning. In addition, we gather certain information automatically as part of your use of the Company cloud products and services, specifically for Assembla and Travis CI entities. This information may include IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, internet service provider, the pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take, operating system and system configuration information and date/time stamps associated with your usage. This information is used to maintain the security of the Services, to provide necessary functionality, as well as to improve performance of the Services, to assess and improve customer and user experience of the Services, to review compliance with applicable usage terms, to identify future opportunities for development of the Services, to assess capacity requirements, to identify customer opportunities and for the security of the Company generally (in addition to the security of our products and Services). Some of the device and usage data collected within the Services, whether alone or in conjunction with other data, could be personally identifying to you. Please note that this usage data is primarily used for the purposes of identifying the uniqueness of each user logging on (as opposed to specific individuals), apart from where it is strictly required to identify an individual for security purposes or as required as part of our provision of the Services to our customers (where we act as a processor).
