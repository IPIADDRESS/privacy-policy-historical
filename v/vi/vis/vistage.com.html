Vistage supports the needs of CEOs and executives by providing a place for CEOs to draw on the experience, advice, and knowledge of their peers.  Vistage membership provides access to more than 13,000 business leaders, expert subject-matter speakers, Vistage executive coaches and performance leaders, and other executives and CEOs, all sharing their judgment, best practices, and experience to help each other succeed.  Vistage members meet once a month for a full day with a group of CEOs, presidents, business owners and other key executives from non-competing industries to engage in a trusted and confidential setting allowing the members to grapple with the small  business issues that can make or break a business.  Members also gather several times a year at regional, national, and international conferences to exchange ideas and connect with fellow members and executive and CEO coaches beyond their own groups.  Finally, Vistage members engage in one-to-one executive coaching with their Vistage executive coach and adviser, an objective business adviser offering peer advice, business insights, professional skill building, accountability, and support.  Members also have access to business workshops in which expert speakers provide fresh thinking, cutting-edge business strategies, and insights on implementation of the most relevant business solutions.">
