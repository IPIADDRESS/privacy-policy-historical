<h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
<p style="font-weight: bold">
This Policy is devised to help you feel more confident about the privacy and security of your personal details. We collect and process personal data only in strict compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and associated legislation.
</p>
<h6>1. Information Gathered</h6>
<p>
Visa Bureau collect personal information from Online Visa Assessments, email and SMS alerts and data capture forms on our website. Cookies are used when entering our site to record the location from where each visitor arrived. These records are used for tracking visitors who come from our affiliate sites and other pre-defined web sources. Each web page access is recorded in a log file. The contents of the log file are analysed each month to determine how many visitors Visa Bureau serve, what pages they look at most, and from where they connect. This information is not shared with anyone outside our organisation. 
</p>

<p>
2. Use of Personal information 
</p>

<p>
Visa Bureau uses your personal information to assess your suitability for different visa classes and your data to tailor our service to match your needs.

Manual destruction of files, records and computer print-outs containing sensitive data are carried out in a secure way by either internally shredding or using a supplier who uses secure disposal methods.
</p>
