<p>
        Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains
        data collection and use practices of the VisitMix.com site (the “Site”) hosted for Microsoft
        by Orcsweb; it does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products
        or services. By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection
        and use practices described in this privacy statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Collecting Your Personal Information</strong>
        <br>
        We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal
        information) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry out a transaction
        that you have requested such as requesting information about Microsoft products
        and services, entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access
        premium site, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing and/or registering
        Microsoft products. The personal information we collect includes your name, title,
        company or organization name, work e-mail, work phone, work or home address, information
        about your job function, information about your company, and credit card information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Site may collect certain anonymous information about your visit, such as the
        name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through
        which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages
        that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from
        which you linked directly to our site. This information is used to help improve
        the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Use of Your Personal Information</strong>
        <br>
        The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site
        and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested
        or authorized.
    </p>
    <p>
        In support of these uses, Microsoft may use personal information to provide you
        with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related Microsoft
        products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need
        for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your
        particular preference or interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about
        the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications.
        Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other Microsoft
        products and services, and/or share information with Microsoft partners so they
        may send you information about their products and services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our
        behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, answering
        customer questions about products and services, and sending information about our
        products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those companies
        the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to
        maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that
        information for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the
        good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of
        the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the Site; (b) protect
        and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and our family of Web sites; or (c)
        act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees
        or agents, users of Microsoft products or services, or members of the public.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United
        States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or
        agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer
        of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework
        as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
        retention of data from the European Union.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Control of Your Personal Information</strong>
        <br>
        Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide
        on the Site will not be shared outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries
        and affiliates without your permission.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Site
        will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to Microsoft
        in the context of other, separately operated, Microsoft products or services.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Access to Your Personal Information</strong>
        <br>
        Customer information is collected by Orcsweb, a Microsoft vendor. It is stored at
        Orcsweb, plus sent back to Microsoft. You can review and edit the personal information
        and any contact preferences provided at the Site by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@orcsweb.com">

    <p>
        <strong>Security of Your Personal Information</strong> Microsoft is committed to protecting
        the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies
        and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access,
        use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on
        computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities.
        Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit
        card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such
        as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cookies</strong>
        <br>
        We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process
        and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your
        hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver
        viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be
        read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
        you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site,
        a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
        This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation,
        and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you previously provided
        can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
        accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies
        if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
        the interactive features of this or other web sites you visit.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Changes to This Privacy Statement</strong>
        <br>
        We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise
        the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material
        changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent
        notice on the home page of our web site or by directly sending you a notification.
        We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed
        about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued
        use of the service constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any
        updates.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Contact Information</strong>
        <br>
        Microsoft welcomes your comments regarding this privacy statement. If you believe
        that Microsoft has not adhered to this privacy statement, please contact us by e-mail
