<h2>YOUR RIGHTS IN RELATION TO THIS INFORMATION </h2>
<p>If you wish to change any of your personal information, please use the facilities available on the Site to correct and update it. <br>You also have the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to the Site at the point where we ask you for that information. For example, if you wish to register to create or use an archive (e.g. a discussion thread) but do not want to receive future newsletters, promotional emails or marketing material, simply put a cross in the relevant box that appears in our registration form. <br>If, after a certain period of time, you decide that you no longer wish to receive newsletters, promotional and marketing emails, you can change your personal profile accordingly. Alternatively, you may decide that you would like to begin to receive newsletters, promotional and marketing emails. <br>In order to change your personal profile, please follow the process set out under 'my details' in the top navigation bar. Please note, however, that we cannot backdate any changes that you make. This means that you could continue to receive information from a particular third party where we have already provided your details to that third party. You will therefore have to contact each such third party if you no longer wish to receive newsletters, promotional and marketing emails directly from them. </p><br>
<h2>POLICY CHANGE </h2>
