This Privacy Policy discloses our information and privacy practices with regard to the Web Site, such as the types of information we may gather from you and how we may use and share that information. Except if specifically stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Web Site and does not apply to information collected offline or otherwise outside of the Web Site.&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>Please take a moment to review the terms of this Privacy Policy. By using the Web Site, you agree to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Web Site.&nbsp; Please also review the <a href="http://www.viacom.com/TERMS OF USE/default.aspx">Terms of Use</a>, which governs your use of the Web Site.&nbsp; Please note that certain features or services discussed in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on the Web Site at any particular time.</p>
<p>TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED</p>
<p>This Web Site is primarily informational, but we may, on occasion, ask you to provide us your name, e-mail address and other contact information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (“PII”). We may collect this information at various places and forms on the Web Site, including when you register for e-mail communications, when you submit information needed to consider you for potential employment opportunities, or when you submit a question or request to the Web Site. We may also collect certain demographic information (such as gender, age or ethnicity) and information about your interests and preferences (collectively, “Demographic Information”).</p>
<p>We retain and use your PII and Demographic Information in order to: (i) send you e-mail communications that you have agreed to receive; (ii) facilitate your job search and prepare governmental and internal statistics reports; (iii) respond to your questions or other requests; (iv) contact you with regard to your use of the Web Site or changes to the Web Site’s Privacy Policy, Terms of Use or other Web Site policies; or (v) for other purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information. We may also use the information you provide to improve the Web Site and its content, features and services; customize your experience on the Web Site; or for other internal business purposes.&nbsp; We may occasionally receive information about you from third parties. If we combine that information with information we collect through the Web Site, we will apply this Privacy Policy to such information. </p>
<p>Please note that information submitted to the Web Site via a “contact us” or other similar mechanism will not necessarily receive a response.</p>
<p>The Web Site is a general audience web site. We do not knowingly collect any PII from children under the age of thirteen (13) on the Web Site and we will delete any information later determined to be from a user younger than thirteen (13). </p>
<p>When you visit this Web Site, our servers automatically collect certain web site usage information.&nbsp; Web site usage information is non-personally identifiable information about how our visitors use and navigate the Web Site, including the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, the length of their stays, the type of browser each visitor is using (for example, Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system each visitor is using, (for example, Windows 2000 or Mac OS), the domain name of each visitor’s Internet service provider (for example, America Online, Earthlink) and certain other information (for example, IP address and clickstream data). An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet, which our web servers use to identify where to send the information your computer requests.&nbsp; When you request pages from the Web Site, our servers log your IP address.&nbsp; We may associate your IP address with the PII you provide to the Web Site. We may use IP addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit use of this Web Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>To enhance your experience with our site, we may use "cookies." Cookies are small data files we place in your computer's browser when you visit the Web Site. Cookies automatically identify your web browser to the Web Site whenever you visit the Web Site, and may make navigating and using the Web Site easier for you.&nbsp; Also, by tracking how and when you use the Web Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not.&nbsp; Additionally, accepting cookies may allow you to, among other things, personalize your experience on the Web Site. If you do not wish to allow for use of cookies, you can generally opt-out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject cookies. However, please be aware that some areas of the Web Site may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. </p>
<p>Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</p>
<p>Our web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "web bug" or "clear gif", and which allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain limited information about the viewer of the web page or e-mail message (such as the type of browser downloading the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed, as well as the URL of the page the web beacon comes from). Web beacons are typically very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel) and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail message, including an advertisement or HTML content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, such as and without limitation, to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate this Web Site, and we may include web beacons or similar technologies in e-mails in order to count how many e-mails (or particular articles, links, etc.) we sent were actually opened.</p>
<p>WITH WHOM INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED</p>
<p>Viacom does not share your PII with third parties for those third parties’ marketing purposes. Viacom may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties. In addition, Viacom may share your PII as set forth in this Privacy Policy or in the following limited circumstances: </p>
<p>Third parties providing services on our behalf</p>
<p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.&nbsp; Examples include, without limitation, sending communications on our behalf, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, creating, hosting and/or providing customer service. These third parties may have access to our users' PII in order to provide these services to us or on our behalf. </p>
<p>Legal Protections and Law Enforcement</p>
<p>We may disclose information about our users, including PII, when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an audit or investigation, or to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing this Web Site and applicable laws, rules, and regulations. We may use IP addresses to identify users in cooperation with internet service providers or law enforcement agencies, and may also disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability or to protect or enforce the rights, interests or safety of this Web Site, our users or others.</p>
<p>Corporate Change</p>
<p>We may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose user information, including PII, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets or of a business group, or other corporate change.</p>
<p>EEOC/Affirmative Action Reporting</p>
<p>In conjunction with laws and regulations enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (“OFCCP”) and similar state and local regulatory agencies, we may ask you to provide us with self-identifying information (such as veteran status, gender and ethnicity).&nbsp; Providing such self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do provide us with such information, we may submit that information, to the EEOC, the OFCCP and similar state and local regulatory agencies for business-related purposes, including, but not limited to responding to information requests, fulfilling regulatory reporting requirements and defending against employment related complaints.&nbsp; </p>
<p>CHANGING YOUR PREFERENCES</p>
<p>You may cancel or modify your e-mail subscriptions through the Web Site or by following the instructions contained within an e-mail you receive from the Web Site. </p>
<p>SECURITY </p>
<p>While Viacom strives to secure your personal information, even reasonable security measures do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit via the internet, including to Viacom. Viacom cannot guarantee that information it seeks to protect will be protected under all circumstances, including those beyond its reasonable control.&nbsp; You agree that you transmit information to Viacom via the Web Site at your own risk.</p>
<p>THIRD PARTY CONTENT</p>
<p>When you are on the Web Site, certain content may be served by a third party. These third parties may also drop their own cookies and/or use web beacons, which may be used to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously had contact with those third parties. We do not control the use of such technology by third parties, the information they collect, or how they use such information.</p>
<p>LINKS TO OTHER SITES AND CONTENT ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THIS WEB SITE</p>
<p>Our Web Site contains links to other web sites, including other web sites within the Viacom family, whose information practices may be different from ours.&nbsp; Visitors should consult the specific privacy policies posted on these sites when linking to them.</p>
<p>CONSENT TO TRANSFER</p>
<p>The Web Site is located in the United States. Your PII will be processed and shared in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may provide different levels of protection compared with non-United States jurisdictions.&nbsp; If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using the Web Site or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS AND CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY </p>
<p>By using this Web Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Viacom may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the types of PII we collect or how we use it, we will inform you of such changes by posting a revised notice at our Web Site.&nbsp; Of course, unless you consent otherwise, we will use your PII consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted your PII. </p>
