						We have organized our websites so that you will not be required to identify yourself or reveal any personal 
						information in order to view our websites. At times, we may ask you to provide information about yourself or 
						your company in order to better serve you. If you choose to provide this personally identifiable information, 
						we will use it in accordance with this Privacy Notice. We provide this Privacy Notice to answer some of the 
						questions you may have about the types of information we may collect from our website and what we may do with 
						that information. By entering this website, you are consenting to the terms of this Privacy Notice. 
						This Privacy Notice only applies to data collected on vioc.com. Individual Ashland Inc. ("Ashland") 
						websites may have privacy notices tailored specifically for activity on those websites, and the terms of 
						those privacy notices may differ to some extent from this Privacy Notice.<br><br>
						<strong>Changes to this Privacy Notice</strong><br>
						We reserve the right to update this Privacy Notice at any time without notice to you. The most current 
						version of the Privacy Notice can be reviewed by clicking on the "Privacy Notice" hypertext link located 
						at the bottom of the web pages on this website. Your use of this website may also be subject to additional 
						<a href="/pages/terms.html" class="feature">terms</a> outlined elsewhere on this website.<br><br>
						<strong>What information do we collect?</strong><br>
						We understand that you expect to learn about Valvoline Instant Oil Change when you visit this website. 
						Similarly, we hope to learn about your needs as a current or potential customer or shareholder through your 
						visits to this website. On some of our web pages, you may be able to ask questions, register to receive 
						information, enter sweepstakes or enter information about your vehicle.<br><br>
						"My Car History" offers a user the opportunity to personalize their online experience by using cookies. We 
						use "cookies" on this website to help you use our services more easily, and to help us keep track of certain 
						statistical information such as IP address, the type of browser and operating system used to access this site, 
						the date and time you access this site, the pages you visit and, if you linked from another website, 
						the address of that website so that we can continuously improve our website and our service to you. A 
						"cookie" is a small data file that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your 
						hard drive to help our website "remember" information about you when you return to our website, such as 
						your preferences for our website and user passwords. Our cookies cannot read data off of your hard drive, 
						cannot read cookie files created by other websites or track any personal information about you. You may be 
						able to set your browser to erase a cookie, reject a cookie or notify you when you receive a cookie. If 
						you erase or reject a cookie, you may still use this website.<br><br>
						<strong>What security measures are in place for "My Car History"?</strong><br>
						VIOC's proprietary and non-sequential card-numbering process makes it less likely that others can obtain 
						your vehicle's MVP number.<br><br>
						<strong>What do we do with this information?</strong><br>
						We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing 
						future visits for you, improving our website and communicating with you. You may decide against participating 
						in data collection by not sending us information which you consider private.<br><br>
						<strong>Will information be sold to third parties?</strong><br>
						Except as set forth in this Privacy Notice, we will not, without your permission, give, sell or provide to 
						others for a fee the information which you provide to us. We will always ask for and obtain your permission 
						before sharing your personal information with third parties not involved in providing the products or 
						services you have requested or with anyone other than Ashland affiliates, business associates or corporate 
						transaction partners, unless we believe in good faith the law supports disclosure without your consent.<br><br>
						<strong>What do we do with the e-mail addresses we collect?</strong><br>
						Valvoline Instant Oil Change is collecting e-mail addresses in an effort to communicate with consumers 
						via e-mail. To use the "MVP System" online, it is required that a user provide their e-mail address. You 
						will be given the opportunity to choose whether or not you would like to receive e-mail communications 
						from VIOC. If you do not select a checkbox, VIOC will assume that you do not wish to receive e-mail 
						communication from VIOC. These options include service reminder notifications and offers, newsletters, 
						product information, etc. If at any time you wish to change your selection about e-mail communication 
						from VIOC, you can do so under "Customer Profile" in the "My Car History" section of the VIOC.com site.<br><br>
						If you choose to opt in to all our offers, you can expect to receive various auto-related service and 
						product e-mail from time to time. We understand that our customers may wish to be selective in opting 
						out of specific offerings of products and services while retaining other services of interest.<br><br>
						<strong>Hyperlinks</strong><br>
						We may provide you with hyperlinks to other websites. Please be aware that we cannot guarantee or vouch 
						for the data collection practices of such other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or 
						statements for those linked websites.<br><br>

						collect personally identifiable information from individuals in this age group. We encourage parents to 
						take an active role in their children's online activities and to talk with their children about 
						disclosing personally identifiable information to websites.<br><br>
