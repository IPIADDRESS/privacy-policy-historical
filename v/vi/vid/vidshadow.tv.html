Vidshadow.tv provides this Privacy Notice to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Vidshadow.tv Sites.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Vidshadow.tv’s <a href="/help/terms">Terms of Use</a>.

    <ul>The Information Vidshadow.tv gathers
    <li> Cookies Information: When you visit the Vidshadow.tv Sites, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Vidshadow.tv uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser.

    <li>Log File Information: When you use the Vidshadow.tv Sites, our servers and that of our ad serving system (including analytics) automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs and analytic systems may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</li>

    <li>Vidshadow.tv uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services. We also use this information to improve the performance and operation of our site.</li>

Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or send messages through the Vidshadow.tv Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the Vidshadow.tv Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.</li>
    <li>We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Vidshadow.tv Site changes or for customer service purposes).</li>
    <li>We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Vidshadow.tv Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.</li>

    <li>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Vidshadow.tv Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>When Vidshadow.tv Discloses Information
    <li> We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
    <li>We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</li>
    <li>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Vidshadow.tv Sites.</li>
    <li>We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</li>

    <p>Third-party Advertisers &amp; Links to Other Sites</p>
    <p>Vidshadow.tv allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Vidshadow.tv Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Vidshadow.tv Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or analytic methodology) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>
    <p>Vidshadow.tv does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Vidshadow.tv to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Vidshadow.tv Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
    <p>Data Security</p>

    <p>Vidshadow.tv uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Vidshadow.tv and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Vidshadow.tv makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
    <p>If Vidshadow.tv learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Vidshadow.tv may post a notice on the Vidshadow.tv Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify our privacy team via email; <a href="mailto:service@vidshadow-inc.com">email our privacy team</a>.</p>

For that reason, Vidshadow.tv does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Vidshadow.tv affiliates from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons less than 13.

    <p>In the event that Vidshadow.tv is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
