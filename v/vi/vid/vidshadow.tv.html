    <p>Vidshadow.tv allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Vidshadow.tv Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Vidshadow.tv Sites.

The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Vidshadow.tv Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
