		<p>This privacy statement pertains to the <a href="http://www.videoprofessor.com">www.videoprofessor.com</a> site.  
		Because  we want to demonstrate our commitment to our users' privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information 
		practices so that you can make an informed decision about providing information when visiting our site</p>
		<p>This privacy statement tells you:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>What personally identifiable information Video Professor collects at the site.</li>
			<li>What personally identifiable information third parties collect through the Video Professor site.</li>
			<li>What organization collects the information.</li>

		<p><strong>If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should first contact our webmaster by: 
		email <a href="mailto:webmaster@videoprofessor.com">webmaster@videoprofessor.com</a>, phone (303) 232-1244, or postal 
		mail 1310 Wadsworth Blvd, Suite 100, Lakewood, CO 80214</strong></p>

		<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

		<p><strong>Information Collection</strong><br>
		Video Professor is the sole owner of the information collected on <a href="http://www.videoprofessor.com">www.videoprofessor.com</a>. Video Professor collects 
		information from our users at several different points on our site, including our landing pages.</p>

		<p><strong>Registration</strong><br>
		In order to use certain areas of this site such as to sign up for our Video Professor Newsletter, a user must first 
		complete a registration form.  During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name, zip 
		code, and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he or she 
		has expressed an interest.  In other areas of the site, such as when registering for the affiliate program or 
		registering as a member or to access an online account, users must provide additional information which can include 
		full address, a username, password, website information, and, in some cases, a social security number or tax 
		identification number so that we can comply with federal laws.  Participation in these areas of the site is completely 
		optional.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Ordering</strong><br>
		We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, 
		and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).  This information is 
		used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, the information is 
		used to contact the user.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Information Use</strong><br>
		When filling an order, Video Professor uses your personal information to process and review order(s) for our software 
		products. Once you have submitted an order for one of our products, we use your information internally to process your 
		order(s), and to personalize Video Professor mailings based on your interests.   Video Professor usually does this by 
		the periodic mailings sent to your postal address (typically along with your product order) or to your email address 
		alerting  you to special offers, newsletters, and commercial offerings that may be of interest. In order to provide 
		services that better meet your needs, we also may supplement the information that you provide to us with other 
		information that we receive from third parties.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Profile</strong><br>
		We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile 
		of our users.  A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.  
		Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and 
		improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site, and to 
		direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.  We share your profile with other third parties, mostly in aggregate, 
		but occasionally, with your permission, your profile is shared together with your personally identifiable information.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
		A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.  We use session ID 
		cookies and persistent cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply 
		terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of 
		time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions at 
		(<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q278835&amp;" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q278835</a> 
		for Internet Explorer and <a href="http://help.netscape.com/kb/consumer/19971020-3.html" target="_blank">http://help.netscape.com/kb/consumer/19971020-3.html</a>) 
		for Netscape.  
		</p>
		
		<p>By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time 
		while on our site.  If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the 
		user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user may not be able to retrieve account information 
		or interact with some of our community features.  Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of 
		our users to enhance the experience on our site.  See the "Profile" section.</p>
		
		<p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site.  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, 
		once we have given permission for them to set cookies.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Log Files</strong><br>
		Like most standard site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, 
		internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze 
		trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for 
		aggregate use.  IP addresses can be tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service.  We 
		use a tracking utility called WebTrends that uses log files to analyze user movement.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong><br>
		We or our third party partner companies employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs),
		 that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny 
		 graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of 
		 Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, 
		 about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs can be tied to users' personally identifiable 
		 information.</p>
		
		<p>Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising 
		company.  That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's 
		clear gif, the Site or advertising company would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's 
		cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given 
		to the advertising company or site.  To learn more about our use of clear gifs, please contact us via email, phone or 
		postal mail at the addresses above.  </p>
		
		<p>In addition, we, or our email deployment partner, use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which 
		emails the recipients have opened.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the 
		effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out 
		section. </p>
		
		<p>This privacy statement covers use of clear gifs by this site only and does not cover use of clear gifs by our 
		partner companies or their third party advertisers.  For information about a partner company's use of clear gifs, 
		please visit their site directly and review their Online privacy statement.</p> 
		
		<h3>Communications from the Site</h3>
		
		<p><strong>Special Offers and Updates</strong><br>
		We send all new customers and members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will 
		occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the 
		privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and 
		Opt-out sections.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Newsletter</strong><br>
		If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name, zip code, and email 
		address.  Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.  Please see the 
		Choice and Opt-out sections.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Service Announcements</strong><br>
		On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if our service 
		is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these 
		communications, though they can deactivate their account.  However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Customer Service</strong><br>
		We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their 
		account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes.</p>
		
		<h3>Sharing</h3>
		
		<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
		Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by 
		law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, 
		a court order or legal process served on our site.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong><br>
		We share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable 
		information.</p>
		
		<p><strong>These are the instances in which we will share users' personal information:</strong><br>
		With your permission, we Share Personal Information with third parties, including our business partners.  For example, 
		with your permission, we may pass your email, name, and other information to a third party that we feel may have 
		products or services which may be of interest to you.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Third Party Intermediaries</strong><br>
		We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods 
		and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary 
		purposes.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>
		We partner with other third parties to provide specific services.  For example, at the conclusion of a sale, you may 
		be offered magazine subscriptions. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or other 
		contact information, such as address and/or phone number that is necessary for the third party to provide these 
		services.  These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of 
		providing these services. </p>
		
		<p><strong>Business Transitions</strong><br>
		In the event Video Professor goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, 
		or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets 
		transferred.  Users will be notified via email and a prominent notice on our site for 30 days prior to a change of 
		ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally 
		identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be 
		given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>
		Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to 
		our site at the point where we ask for information.  For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users 
		who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.</p>
		
		<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these 
		communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at 
		<a href="mailto:remove@videoprofessor.com">remove@videoprofessor.com</a> or the user may contact us at 303-232-1244 or 
		1310 Wadsworth Blvd, Suite 100, Lakewood, CO 80214 to opt-out.</p>
		
		<p>Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this 
		so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an 
		outside party.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Links</strong><br>
		This site contains links to other sites and we will, on occasion, create partnerships with reputable third-party 
		companies, where we host their content, or vice versa. Please be aware that we, Video Professor, are not responsible 
		for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to 
		read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy 
		statement applies solely to information collected by this site. </p> 
		
		<p><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong><br>
		From time-to-time our site offers users the opportunity to participate in surveys or contests.  We may request 
		information from users via surveys or contests but participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary 
		and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically 
		includes contact information such as name and shipping address and demographic information (such as zip code).  
		Contact information will be used and shared with the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes.  
		Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Users' 
		personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we 
		may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable 
		information for any secondary purposes.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong><br>
		If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name 
		and email address.  Video Professor will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the 
		site.  Video Professor stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the 
		success of our referral program.  The friend may contact Video Professor at 
		<a href="mailto:remove@videoprofessor.com">remove@videoprofessor.com</a> to request the removal of this information 
		from our database.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
		This site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the 
		site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
		
		<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or 
		social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the 
		industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as 
		Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are 
		just 'surfing'.  To learn more about SSL, follow this link 
		<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html" target="_blank">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html</a>.
		</p>
		<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect 
		user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is 
		restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
		billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  
		Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Periodically, as well as any 
		time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, 
		and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that store personally 
		identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.</p> 
		
		<p>If users have any questions about the security at our site, users can send an email to 
		<a href="mailto:webmaster@videoprofessor.com">webmaster@videoprofessor.com</a></p>
		
		<p><strong>Supplementation of Information</strong> <br>
		In order for this site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the 
		information we receive with information from third party sources.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Enhancement of Marketing Profile</strong><br>
		We purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and 
		provide pertinent offers we think our users would be interested in.  We use this information to enhance or overlay 
		the 'profile' of individual users. This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to the users' personally 
		identifiable information.  See also the "Profile" section.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</strong><br>
		If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a 
		user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally 
		identifiable information. This can usually be done by emailing our Customer Support at 
		<a href="mailto:webmaster@videoprofessor.com">webmaster@videoprofessor.com</a>.  Or, by contacting us by telephone or 
		postal mail at the contact information listed below.</p>

		</p>
		
		<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
		If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Online privacy statement, the homepage, 
		and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and 
		under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under 
		which the information was collected. </p>
		
		<p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated 
		at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
		information in this different manner.  However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or 
		deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in 
		this new manner.  In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user 
		information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our site notifying users of the 
		change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications 
		from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
