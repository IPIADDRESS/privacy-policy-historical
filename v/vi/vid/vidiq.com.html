            <h3>Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h3>

            <p>We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services. We or our service providers may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.</p>

            <p><b>Do Not Track.</b> Our Site does not respond to Do Not Track signals, but we do not track your activities after you leave our Site. You may disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).</p>

            <p><b>Cookies.</b> We or our service providers may use cookies to track visitor activity on our Site. A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We or our service providers may use cookies to track user activities on our Site, such as the pages visited and time spent on our Site. Most browsers allow users to refuse cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies may not be able to browse certain areas of the Site.</p>

            <p><b>Local Storage Objects.</b> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>

            <p><b>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</b> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags) in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about Site usage. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>

            <p><b>Third-Party Analytics.</b> We or our service providers use automated devices and applications to evaluate use of our Site. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We or our service providers use these tools to help us improve our Site, Services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.</p>

            <h3>User-Generated Content</h3>

            <p>We invite you to post content to our Services, including your comments, pictures, and any other information that you would like to be available on our Services. If you post content to our Services, all of the information that you post and your web alias will be available to all visitors to our Site and users of our Services. If you post your own content on our Site or Services, your posting may become public and we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law or your personal privacy.</p>

            <h3>Third-Party Links</h3>

            <p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.</p>

            <h3>Security of My Personal Information</h3>

            <p>We have implemented security measures to protect the personal information we collect, but no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, computer, or mobile device by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>

            <h3>Access to My Personal Information</h3>

            <p>You may modify or delete personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your “Settings”.
