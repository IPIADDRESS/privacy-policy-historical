				<p>Welcome to saymedia.com ("Site"), a Website owned and operated by Say Media, Inc. (“Say Media”). This privacy policy covers 
					how Say Media collects and uses information on the Site.</p>

				<p>In addition to the Site itself, Say Media uses an ad network called the Say Media Ad Platform Online Program 
					to display advertisements on the Site (the “Program”).  Say Media is a member of TRUSTe's TRUSTed Data Program 
					and the Say Media Program has been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including 
					transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your information.  To get a better 
					understanding of the Program and how Say Media collects and uses information in connection with the Program, 
					<a href="/privacy-policy" target="blank">click here</a>.</p>

				<p>Please note that this privacy policy only applies to information Say Media collects at the Site and not any 
					websites, webpages, blogs, applications, widgets or other experiences operated by any third party including our 
					affiliates, advertisers, providers and partners.</p>

				<p>We know that some of the words and concepts used in this privacy policy may be difficult to understand. To help 
					you, we’ve included a brief glossary of terms which can be accessed by <a href="#glossary">clicking here</a>.</p>

				<p>This privacy policy does not apply to: (i) people employed by Say Media or to entities owned or controlled by Say 
					Media; and (ii) any websites, webpages, blogs, applications, widgets or other experiences offered by our 
					participating affiliates and advertisers.</p>

				<h5>Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information.</h5>
				<p>Say Media may collect personally identifiable information when you register for the Site or for the use of certain 
					features and services, such as email updates.  </p>

				<p>Say Media does not share personally identifiable information we learn about you with others except as described 
					in this policy. </p>

				<p>Say Media does not share your personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties for their direct 
					marketing purposes. Say Media may use your personally identifiable information where it is necessary to operate 
					or improve the Site, to do something that you have asked us to do or tell you about Say Media products, services 
					and marketing events that we think may be of interest.</p>

				<p>To receive optional email messages such as email updates and marketing and promotional offers, you will be 
					required to provide us with your email address.  In additional to these optional email messages, Say Media may 
					contact you via any email address you provide us with transactional or relationship messages such as account status 
					messages, notifications of changes in the terms of your account or the services provided.  These types of transactional 
					or relationship email messages are not optional.</p>

				<h5>Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information on this site.</h5>
				<p>When visiting the Site, Say Media or its providers collect non-personally identifiable information that allow us to 
					better understand how visitors interact with the Site. Say Media also serves advertisements directly to you within 
					the Site and may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third party advertising serving companies to 
					serve advertisements directly to you within the Site. Say Media may use the non-personally identifiable information it 
					ollects to assist us in delivering relevant advertisements to you when you visit the Site.  These third-party advertising 
					networks and advertisers may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track non-personally identifiable 
					information such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist them in delivering 
					advertising that is more relevant to your interests.</p>

				<p>Say Media implements certain technologies to enable us to collect such information. An explanation of those technologies 
					is described below.</p>

				<p><i>Cookies. </i>
				Say Media uses both session and persistent cookies on this Site. We use cookies to assist us in understanding how the Site 
				is used and improving our site. Our use of cookies on this Site is anonymous and does not allow us to gather personally 
				identifiable information about you.</p>
				<p>If you do not want us to maintain cookies while you are visiting this Site, you can configure your browser’s settings 
					to limit the acceptance of or disable cookies. Please note that some aspects of the Site may not properly function or 
					display if you limit or disable cookies.</p>

				<p><i>Web Beacons/Click-stream Data. </i>
				Say Media uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to collect click-stream data that helps us better understand how 
				visitors move from page to page within the Site. As with cookies, our use of web beacons is anonymous and does not allow us 
				to gather personally identifiable information about you.</p>

				<p><i>Passive Browser Information/Server Logs. </i>
				Say Media collects passive browser information through its web servers. We use the passive browser information and 
				server logs to help us understand how many visitors come to the Site, where they may come from and ultimately to help us 
				make decisions about how to organize the Site.</p>
				<p>You can learn more about advertising displayed on the Site as well as how you can control the use of your data for such 
					advertising by <a href="/privacy-policy" target="blank">clicking here</a>.</p>


				<h5>Information Sharing</h5>

					instances in which personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information may be shared with 
					third parties.</p>

				<p><i>Non-personally identifiable information. </i>
				In connection with this Site, we may share non-personally identifiable information with our family of companies or other 
				trusted businesses or persons for purposes of processing non-personally identifiable information or providing other services

				(i) if Say Media has your consent for the sharing of personally identifiable information; or (ii) to assist in the fulfillment 
				of requests for services that you’ve requested from Say Media (for example, we may use a third party to help send e-mails in 
				response to requests you’ve made). Note that any third party that Say Media chooses to share personally identifiable 
				information will be required to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Say Media. Say Media may share your personally 
				identifiable information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights or, 
				defend against legal claims and if in our judgment in such circumstances disclosure is required or appropriate. In addition, 
				Say Media may share your personally identifiable information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, 
				or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety 
				of any person, violations of the terms and conditions that may apply to our services, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
				<p>If Say Media sells all or part of its business or services, information you have shared with Say Media or Say Media has 
					collected (both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable) may be one of the business assets that will be 
					transferred. The transferred information will remain subject to the promises made in this privacy policy or subsequent 
					policies to which you have consented.</p>

				<h5>Data Security</h5>
				<p>Say Media makes reasonable efforts to ensure data security on our systems to protect against unauthorized access to or 
					unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be 
					guaranteed to be secure. As a result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us 
					and you do so at your own risk.</p>

					or she has the consent of the parent or legal guardian of such person and to provide reasonable verification required 
					by Say Media. Say Media does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information of anyone under 13 years of age, 
					and if we discover that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it. Parents and 
					legal guardians may request us to review, delete or stop the collection of personally identifiable information of 
					their child by contacting us at the email or postal addresses listed below.</p>


				<h5>Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information in the Program</h5>
				<p><i>Other Third Party Sources. </i>
					Say Media may supplement the information it collects with other non-personally identifiable information it obtains 
					from third parties.</p>

				<h5>Modifications to Privacy Policy</h5>

					Say Media will post any revised privacy policy on this Site. Your continued access of this Site and your use of 
					services after the privacy policy has been modified and posted will signify your acceptance of such modifications for 
					information provided by you.</p>
