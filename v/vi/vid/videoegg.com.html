        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy describes how VideoEgg treats certain information provided by you in connection with your access to and use of the VideoEgg website (the "Service"). This privacy policy does not apply to people not employed by VideoEgg or to entities not owned or controlled by VideoEgg.

<p>This privacy policy is incorporated into and is subject to the VideoEgg terms and conditions of use. If you do not agree to the terms of this privacy policy or the VideoEgg terms and conditions of us, do not provide VideoEgg with any information and do not use the Service. This privacy policy may be modified by VideoEgg in its sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you. We will post any revised privacy policy on the Service. Your continued use of the Service after the privacy policy has been modified and posted will signify your acceptance of such modifications for information provided by you.</p>

<p><strong>Information we collect.</strong><br>
We may collect personal information about you in connection with your use of the Service. Such information may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, IP address, biographical information and other personally identifiable information belonging to you. We may collect such information when you register with the Service and in connection with your transactions with us and some of our business partners.

We do not share your personally identifiable information with outside parties. However, personally identifiable information you include in Content that you upload, transmit, post or otherwise make generally available using the Service may be viewed by others and is not subject to this privacy policy, and you may receive unsolicited messages as a result. In addition, when you post a message, your user id or alias may be viewed by others.

When you send post a video, your IP address may be displayed to the owners or maintainers of certain journals or blogs. We may use or share your personal information where it is necessary to complete a transaction, to operate or improve the Service or to do something that you have asked us to do. We may use your personal information internally to assist us in categorizing or contextualizing advertising content, and we may share aggregated, non-personal information (which does not identify you individually), such as the number of users who viewed or clicked on a particular advertisement.</p>

<p>We may share your personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights or, defend against legal claims and if in our judgment in such circumstances disclosure is required or appropriate. In addition, we may share your personal information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our various terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. If we sell our business or all or part of the Service, personally identifiable information you have shared with us may be one of the business assets that will be transferred. The transferred personally identifiable information will remain subject to the promises made in this privacy policy or subsequent policies to which you have consented.</p>
