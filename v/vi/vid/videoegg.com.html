    correction and/or deletion of certain types of information that we
    collect. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as
    described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to
    information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other

<h6>Information We Collect</h6>
<strong>A. Personally Identifiable Information</strong>

<p>In general, Say Media does not collect personally identifiable
    information on the Say Media Services, except as set forth below. For
    purposes of this Privacy Policy, "personally identifiable information"
    is data intended to be used to identify, contact or locate a person,
    including, name, address, telephone number or e-mail address and any
    other information (even if non-personally identifiable) provided in
    combination with such personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail
    address, when you register for, use, send messages, or post content on
    or though the Say Media Services, including registering for the use of
    certain features such as email newsletters, promotional offers, sharing
    a design file, sweepstakes, or the "share an ad" or "movie times"
    features, creating an account on the Say Media Services, and registering
    with the Program as an Affiliate. If you correspond with us by email, we
    may retain the content of your email messages, your email address, and
    our responses. We may also retain any messages or other content you send
    through or post on the Say Media Services. </p>

<p>The advertisements we deliver may offer the ability to interact,
    including playing a game or viewing a video. The ad may also give you
    the opportunity to provide the advertiser with information about
    yourself. In some instances, if you choose to interact with an
    advertisement or provide an advertiser with information about yourself,
    Say Media may collect information on behalf of the advertiser. In that
    case, the advertiser's privacy policy would apply to the data collected
    and we will abide by the instructions given to us by the advertiser in
    our handling of the data. Say Media will not associate any information
    (non-personally identifiable or personally identifiable) we collect for
    an advertiser with any other information we may have collected about you
    through the Say Media Services.</p>

<p>Say Media may collect information about your transactions with us and/or
    our business partners, and combine such information with information
    about you in our possession. This information might include information
    necessary to process payments, such as billing information and your
    credit card number.</p>

<strong>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>

<p>When you visit the Say Media Services, Say Media or third parties such as
    advertisers, third-party advertising networks, third-party advertising
    serving companies, and Say Media business partners, vendors and service
    providers may collect non-personally identifiable information. For
    purposes of this Privacy Policy, "non-personally identifiable
    information" is data that is not personally identifiable. Say Media and
    these third parties may implement certain technologies to enable the
    collection of such information. An explanation of these technologies is
    below.</p>

<p><em><strong>Cookies Information:</strong></em> When you visit the Say
    Media Services, we may send one or more cookies—a small text file
    containing a string of alphanumeric characters—to your computer that
    uniquely identifies your browser and lets Say Media help you log in
    faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also
    convey information about how you browse the Say Media Services. Say
    Media uses session, persistent, flash and browser cookies. The use of
    cookies on the Say Media Services is anonymous and does not allow us to
    gather personally identifiable information about you. A persistent
    cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
    Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to
    the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web
    browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after
    you close your browser. You can set your web browser to refuse all
    cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some
    features of the Say Media Services may not function properly if the
    ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

<p><em><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong></em> When you access the Say
    Media Services by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect,
    monitor and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device
    identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or
    associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile
    device and are used by Say Media to enhance your use of the Say Media
    Services. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the
    device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating
    system or other software, or data sent to the device by Say Media. A
    device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse the
    Say Media Services. A device identifier does not collect or share any
    personally identifiable information about you. However, a device
    identifier may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner
    that may constitute personally identifiable information. A device
    identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in
    faster and enhance your navigation through the Say Media Services. Some
    features of the Say Media Services may not function properly if use or
    availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. </p>

<p><em><strong>Location Data:</strong></em> When you access the Say Media
    Services by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor
    and/or remotely store "location data," which may include GPS coordinates
    (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the
    location of your mobile device. Location data may convey information to
    us about how you browse the Say Media Services. Location data does not
    collect or share any personally identifiable information about you.
    However, location data may be used in conjunction with other information
    in a manner that may constitute personally identifiable information.
    Some features of the Say Media Services, particularly location-based
    services, may not function properly if use or availability of location
    data is impaired or disabled.</p>

<p><em><strong>Web Beacons/Click-Stream Data:</strong></em> A web beacon is
    an electronic file that signals when a webpage, advertisement, video,
    other content, an email, or a newsletter has been viewed. We may use web
    beacons in our emails and newsletters, or on our websites and services.
    Say Media uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to collect
    click-stream data that helps us better understand how visitors move from
    page to page within our websites. As with cookies, our use of web
    beacons is anonymous and does not allow us to gather personally
    identifiable information about you.</p>

<p><em><strong>Passive Browser Information:</strong></em> Say Media collects
    passive browser information though its web servers. We use the passive
    browser information to help us understand how many visitors come to our
    websites and where they come from, and ultimately to help us make
    decisions about how to organize the websites and deliver advertising.
</p>

<p><em><strong>Demonstrations:</strong></em> Say Media periodically offers
    visitors to its websites the ability to see demonstrations of services
    offered by Say Media. If you elect to view demonstrations, we may
    collect non-personally identifiable information in connection with the
    demonstration of the relevant service. Our collection, storage and use
    of non-personally identifiable information in connection with such
    demonstrations are subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><em><strong>Log File Information:</strong></em> Log file information is
    automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.
    When you use the Say Media Services, our servers automatically record
    certain log file information. These server logs may include information
    such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser
    type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names,
    landing pages, pages viewed, data about how you interact with links on
    the Say Media Services, and other such information. We may display your
    IP address to the owners or maintainers of certain blogs, groups or
    communities if you post to those blogs, groups or communities and the
    owner or maintainer has enabled functionality for this purpose.</p>


<p><em><strong>Scripts:</strong></em> A script is a short segment of
    computer code included in a web page or other content that can be used
    to set and access a cookie on your computer's hard drive and to record
    your activity on a website. Say Media may use scripts on the Say Media
    Services, on third-party websites, or in our emails and newsletters.</p>

<p><em><strong>Third-Party Data Providers:</strong></em> Say Media may
    supplement the information it collects with other non-personally
    identifiable information provided by third-party data providers. The
    information provided may include estimates of your age, gender and your
    interests, but does not include personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><em><strong>Other Third-Party Service Providers:</strong></em> In
    connection with our services, Say Media may engage third parties to
    provide services or to support aspects of our business on our behalf. In
    connection with those relationships, such third parties may collect data
    on our behalf. In that case, the third party would only collect and use
    such information as instructed by us and in accordance with this Privacy
    Policy.</p>

<p><em><strong>Third Party Use of Technologies:</strong></em> Third parties
    may set and access their own cookies, use their own web beacons, and use
    their own scripts on and through the Say Media Services, on and through
    third-party websites, or in and through our emails and newsletters. How
    other companies use their own cookies, web beacons and scripts and the
    information they gather is subject to those companies' privacy policies,
    not this Privacy Policy.</p>

<strong>C. Third Party Advertisements</strong>

<p>If an advertiser asks Say Media to show an advertisement to a certain
    audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad
    server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they
    are trying to reach. In addition, third-party advertisers may use
    non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Say
    Media Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and
    services that they believe may be of interest to you. If you would like
    more information about this practice and to know your choices about not
    having this information used by these companies, click <a href="http://appnexus.com/platform-policy">here</a> and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">here</a>. This
    Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities
    of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy
    policies of such advertisers for more information.</p>

<h6>2. How We Use Your Information</h6>
<strong>A. Personally Identifiable Information</strong>

<p>We use the personally identifiable information that we collect to
    operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of
    the Say Media Services.</p>

<p>By providing Say Media with your email address, including by registering
    an account with one of the Say Media Services, you consent to our use of
    the email address to send you notices related to the Say Media Services,
    including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by
    postal mail. We may also contact you via email with transactional or
    relationship messages, such as messages related to your registration or
    account status, and notifications of changes to the terms of your
    account or the services provided. By providing your email address, you
    agree that we may send you notifications of activity on the Say Media
    Services to that email address, in accordance with any applicable
    privacy settings. We may use your email address to send you other
    messages, such as newsletters, information about changes to features of

<h6>How We Share Your Information</h6>

<strong>A. Personally Identifiable Information</strong>

<p>Say Media will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information
    to others. Say Media only shares personally identifiable information
    with other companies or individuals outside of the Say Media Services as
    follows: (1) if Say Media has your consent to the sharing of personally
    identifiable information (e.g., when you sign up for a particular
    marketing program that requires the sharing of information); (2) to
    assist in delivering services that you have requested from Say Media
    (e.g., we may use a third party to help send emails in response to
    requests that you have made); (3) to provide Say Media's services to
    you; (4) with our advertisers if we have been engaged to collect data on
    their behalf, as described in the "Information We Collect" section
    above; (5) to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to
    assist government enforcement agencies, to establish or exercise our
    legal rights, or to defend against legal claims; (6) if we believe it is
    necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
    third-party claims or allegations, illegal activities, suspected fraud,
    situations involving potential threats to the safety or property of
    another person, violation of our <a href="http://www.iab.net/guidelines/508676/tscs3">Terms and
        Conditions of Service</a>; or (7) as otherwise required by law. Note
    that, with respect to disclosures occurring pursuant to (2) or (3),
    above, any third-party with which Say Media shares personally
    identifiable information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. Say Media
    may also store personally identifiable information and user content in
    locations outside the direct control of Say Media (for instance, on
    servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>

<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for
    posting to the Say Media Services, such as messages, comments or other
    user content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any
    applicable privacy settings. To change your privacy settings for any Say
    Media website at which you maintain an account, click on the "My
    Account," "Account," or "Account Preferences" button or link on the
    applicable website or send an email to privacy@saymedia.com. If you
    remove information that you have posted on the Say Media Services,
    copies may remain viewable in cached and archived form, or if other
    users have copied or saved that information.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events
    or activities ("Events") on the Say Media Services, together with a
    third-party partner. If you provide information to such third parties,
    you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any
    other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your
    information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or
    shared in this way, you can choose not to participate in these
    Events.</p>

<strong>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>

<p>In the event that we use a third party to provide services or to support
    aspects of our business on our behalf, Say Media may share
    non-personally identifiable information with the third party to be used
    by them only for the purpose of providing their services to Say
    Media.</p>

<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous
    usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of
    clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the
    usage patterns for certain Say Media Services, and as part of the
    function of our business. For example, we may share the number of ad
    views, ad clicks and content views to help calculate the payments due
    under the Program.</p>

<strong>C. Transfer of Data</strong>

<p>In the event that Say Media sells, transfers or otherwise relinquishes
    all or part of our assets, business offerings, or services, including
    any of the Say Media Services, information that you have shared with Say
    Media or that Say Media has collected, including both personally
    identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information,
    may be one of the business assets that will be transferred. We may also
    transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate
    divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. The transferred information will
    remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy or those of
    subsequent policies to which you have consented. If Say Media is
    involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its
    assets, you will be notified via a prominent notice on our website of
    any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as
    any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>

<h6>4. Content Removal</h6>

<p>Say Media reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the user
    content you post on any of the Say Media Services. We reserve the right
    to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason,
    including without limitation if in our sole opinion such information or
    material violates, or may violate, any law or our <a href="http://www.iab.net/guidelines/508676/tscs3">Terms and
        Conditions of Service</a>, or to protect or defend our rights or
    property or those of any third party. Say Media also reserves the right
    to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>

<h6>5. Data Retention</h6>

<p>Following termination or deactivation of any Say Media Service account,
    Say Media may retain your profile information and user content for a
    commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.
    Furthermore, Say Media may retain and continue to use indefinitely all
    information (including user content) contained in your communications to
    other users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Say Media
    Services after termination or deactivation of your account.</p>

<p>Say Media retains the specific anonymous data collected and tied to your
    computer's unique ID as described in this Privacy Policy for a period of
    up to twelve months. Such data may be aggregated and used for analytical
    purposes indefinitely.</p>

<h6>6. How We Protect Your Information</h6>

<p>Say Media cares about the integrity and security of your personal
    information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any
    information you transmit to Say Media or guarantee that your information
    on the Say Media Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
    destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial
    safeguards. The transmittal of information from you to us is done at
    your own risk.</p>

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as
    requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting
    you access to any accounts maintained on the Say Media Services. You are
    responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and
    account information, and for controlling access to your email
    communications from Say Media, at all times.</p>

<h6>7. Compromise of Personal Information</h6>

<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a
    breach of security, Say Media will promptly notify those persons whose
    personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the
    notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as
    otherwise required by law.</p>

<h6>8. Your Choices About Your Information</h6>

<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information
    through the Service, in which case Say Media may not be able to provide
    certain services to you. You may update or correct your account
    information and email preferences at any time by adjusting your account
    settings or contacting us at privacy@saymedia.com. You can review and
    correct the information about you that Say Media keeps on file by
    contacting us directly at privacy@saymedia.com.</p>

<p>If you do not want Say Media to gather non-personally identifiable
    information when you encounter advertisements we deliver through the Say
    Media Services, please <a href="/privacy-policy.php#top">click the
        opt-out button at the top of this Privacy Policy</a>. The opt-out
    works by placing a cookie on your computer that notifies Say Media that
    no other cookies should be placed on the applicable computer. If this
    cookie is deleted, then you will need to complete this opt-out process
    again. If you use more than one computer, you will need to complete this
    opt-out process on each computer that you use. The opt-out does not mean
    that you will no longer see online advertisements. It means only that
    advertisements delivered by Say Media will not be targeted to you, based
    on information derived from cookies by Say Media or its third-party
    vendors.</p>

<p>You can also limit targeted advertising by configuring your browser's
    settings or changing the management panel of the Adobe Flash Player to
    limit your acceptance of or delete cookies. Because the management of
    cookies in various browsers differs, you should consult the
    documentation for your browser in order to manage your cookies. In order
    to limit the acceptance of or disable "flash" cookies, you must access
    the management panel of the Adobe Flash Player installed on your
    computer. To learn more about the management panel of the Adobe Flash
    Player and the management of "flash" cookies, please access the
    following link: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/index.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/index.html</a>.
    You can also opt-out of receiving cookies from third-party data
    providers by following the instructions at: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.
    TRUSTe also provides you with ways to opt-out of behavioral tracking at:
    http://preferences.truste.com/truste. You can opt-out of receiving
    cookies from Targusinfo, a specific third-party data provider, by
    following the instructions at: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.adadvisor.net/optout.html</a>.
    Also, because your choices are not associated with you as a particular
    individual, if you change computers, web browsers or cookie settings,
    you will need to re-implement your preferences as described above. Note
    that if you limit or disable cookies, this does not mean that you will
    not see ads on the Say Media Services. Instead, ads will be displayed
    that are based on passive browser information or other information that
    that may be provided by the Say Media Services at the time of your
    visit.</p>

<h6>9. Children's Privacy</h6>

<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Say
    Media and its related websites are not structured to attract children
    under 13 years of age. Say Media prohibits the use of our websites or
    services by anyone under 13 years of age. Say Media does not knowingly
    collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13

    Services. If you are under 13, please do not access the Say Media
    Services or send any information about yourself to us, including your
    name, address, telephone number, or email address. In the event that we
    learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age
    13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
    information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have
    any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at
    privacy@saymedia.com.</p>
