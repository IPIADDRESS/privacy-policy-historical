	<h2>What Personal Information About Customers Does Video Secrets Gather?</h2>
		
	<p><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any 
	information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way.  You can choose not 
	to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of 
	many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as 
	responding to your requests, customizing future visits for you, improving our services, 
	and communicating with you.</p>
	
	
	<p><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store 
	certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many 
	Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your 
	Web browser accesses Video Secrets.  A number of companies offer utilities designed 
	to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Due to the sensitive issues involving 
	access to adult content by children, we do not permit access to our sites from 
	these anonymous services.</p>
	
	<p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol 
	(IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login name; e-mail 
	address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and 
	version, operating system, and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform 
	Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including 
	date and time; cookie number; products you viewed; services you visited; your 
	customer service history, and phone number used to call our 800 number.</p>
	
	<br><hr><br>
	
	
	<h2>What About Cookies?</h2>
	
	<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard 
	drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser 
	and to provide features such as "What's New".</p>
	
	<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
	your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when 
	you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies 
	allow you to take full advantage of some of VideoSecrets' coolest services, and 
	we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p> 

	<br><hr><br>



	<h2>Does Video Secrets Share the Information It Receives?</h2>
		
	<p>Information about our affiliates is an important part of our business, and we are not in 
	the business of selling it to others.  We share customer information only with the 
	subsidiaries Video Secrets, controls and as described below.</p>

	<p><strong>Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals 
	to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments 
	in real time, sending e-mail notifications or updates, and providing customer 
	service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, 
	but they do not have our authorization to use it for other purposes.</p>

	<p><strong>Promotional Offers:</strong> Sometimes we send offers to 
	selected groups of VideoSecrets affiliates on behalf of other businesses. When we do 
	this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to 
	receive such offers, please send email 
	to <a href="mailto:remove@vs.com">remove@vs.com</a></p>
	
	<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our 
	business, we might sell or buy sites or assets. In such transactions, affiliate 
	information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely 
	event that VideoSecrets, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, affiliate 
	information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>

	<p><strong>Protection of Video Secrets and Others:</strong> We 
	release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate 
	to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; 
	or protect the rights, property, or safety of Video Secrets, our users, or 
	others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for 
	fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

	<p><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you 
	will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will 
	have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p> 
	
	<br><hr><br>
	
	

	<h2>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h2>
	
	<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using 
	Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.</p>

	<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your account 
	passwords and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared 
	computer.</p>
	
	<br><hr><br>
	
	

	<h2>What Information Can I Access?</h2>
		
	<p>Video Secrets gives you access to the following information about you 
	for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. 
	This list will change as our Web site evolves.</p>
	
	<p><a href="/secure/">Your Account Information</a></p>
	
	<br><hr><br>
	
	
	
	<h2>What Choices Do I Have?</h2>
	
	<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please send 
	email to <a href="mailto:remove@vs.com">remove@vs.com</a> (If you 
	do not want to receive Terms and Conditions and other legal notices from us, 
	such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of 
	Video Secrets, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)</p> 
	
	<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
	your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when 
	you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you 
	will not be able to use such services as Video Secrets and other 
	live shows if you do not use cookies.</p>

	<p>In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about 
	online privacy on its own Web site, Site Seeing on the 
	Internet <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee/index.html</a>.</p>

	<br><hr><br>
	
	
	<h2>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h2>

	<p>If you choose to visit Video Secrets, your visit and any 
	dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms and Conditions, 
	including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of 
	the law of the state of California. If you have any concern about privacy at 
	Video Secrets, please send us a thorough description 
	to <a href="mailto:sales@videosecrets.com">sales@videosecrets.com</a>, and we
	will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly. This Notice and the 
	Terms and Conditions will change also, and use of information that we gather 
	now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. We may e-mail 
	periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed 
	us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.</p>
	
	<br><hr><br>
	
	
	
	<h2>Opt-Out Instructions</h2>

	<p>If you do not wish to receive emails about our service please use one of the 
	following means to remove yourself.  We certainly do not wish to market to anyone 
	who doesn't want it!</p>
