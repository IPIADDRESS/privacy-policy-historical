Except where we otherwise obtain your express permission, we share your Information with third parties only under the limited circumstances stated below:
            <ol>

                <li>Information is subject to disclosure to protect our rights or property, protect its legitimate business interests, to enforce the provisions of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and/or to prevent harm to you or others; </li>
                <li>Information may be disclosed to carefol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"ly selected third-party service providers in order to provide services to you, such as to complete orders (U.S. Postal Service, Canada Post, or other delivery companies we or you select); provide customer service; send or email Marketing Communications; maintain our customer loyalty program and database and other programs; monitor the activity of our Website; conduct surveys; and administer contests or sweepstakes.
