				  <p><strong>VidHog, Inc.</strong> ("VidHog") recognizes that its customers,  visitors, users, and others who use the web site <a href="http://www.vidhog.com/"><font size="2" color="blue">www.vidhog.com</font></a> (“the Site”) (collectively or  individually "Users") value their privacy. This Privacy Notice  details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User  information collected on the Site. VidHog provides this Privacy Notice to help  you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Site.<br>
				    This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the <a href="http://youtube.com/t/terms">VidHog Terms of Use</a>. Your use of the Site  and any personal information you provide on the Site remains subject to the  terms of this Privacy Notice and our <a href="http://youtube.com/t/terms">Terms  of Use</a>.<br>
				    Please note that any image or other content posted at the direction of Users  onto the Site becomes published content and is not considered personally  identifiable information subject to this Privacy Notice.</p>
				  <h2>The Information VidHog Collects</h2>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li><strong>User Provided Information:</strong> You provide certain personally identifiable information (such as your name       and email address) to VidHog when choosing to participate in various       activities on the Site such as receiving credit for sharing videos, posting       messages in the video comments section, entering contests or sweepstakes,       taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to       newsletters or other mailing lists.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li><strong>Cookies Information:</strong> When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text       file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer       that uniquely identifies your browser. VidHog uses both session cookies       and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your       browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent       visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your       web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and       disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to       refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However,       some features of the Site may not function properly if the ability to       accept cookies is disabled.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li><strong>Log File Information:</strong> When you use the Site, our servers automatically record certain       information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.       These server logs may include information such as your web request,       Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser       language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of       clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those       pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of       your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your       browser.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li><strong>Clear GIFs Information:</strong> When you use the Site, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web       Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users       anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition,       we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track       which emails are opened by recipients.&nbsp;       Information gathered in this fashion will not monitor Users at       online locations other than the Site.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <h2>The Way VidHog Uses Information</h2>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>If you submit personally       identifiable information to us through the Site, then we use your personal       information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and       functionality of the Site.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Any personal information you       voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat       areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available       and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email       address) is displayed to other Users when you send messages through the Site       and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. </li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>We do not use your email       address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or       marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific       program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or       opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent       for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of       major VidHog Site changes or for customer service purposes).</li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>We use both your personally       identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable       information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses,       browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of       the Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and       services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>We use cookies, clear gifs,       and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not       have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site;       (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the       effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics       such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your       entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <h2>When VidHog Discloses Information</h2>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>We provide personally       identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to       our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for       the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that       these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our       privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such       information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security       measures.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>We do not share your       personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with       other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without       your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which       you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>We do share       non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage       data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks,       etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the       usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions,       and/or functionality on the Site.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>We may release personally       identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if       required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is       necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court       order, subpoena, or search warrant.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>VidHog also reserves the       right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or       non-personally-identifiable information that VidHog believes, in good       faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our <a href="http://youtube.com/t/terms">Terms of Use</a>, take precautions       against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any       third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement       agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to       protect the rights, property, or personal safety of VidHog, our Users or       others.</li>
			      </ul>
				  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
				  <p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information  through the Site, in which case VidHog may not be able to provide certain  services to you. You may update or correct your personal profile information  and email preferences at any time by visiting your <a href="http://youtube.com/my_profile_email">account profile page</a>. <br>
				    To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as  requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you  profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the  secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.<br>
				    Please contact VidHog with any questions or comments about this Privacy  Notice, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out  choices using this <a href="http://youtube.com/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
				  <h2>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h2>
				  <p>VidHog allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks,  to serve advertisements within the Site. These third-party ad servers or ad  networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements  and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your IP address  when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies,  JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their  advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.<br>
				    VidHog does not provide any personally identifiable information to these  third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of  a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or  opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks VidHog to show an  advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience  segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of  content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may  conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.  The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Site, such as  the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable  information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.&nbsp; VidHog's privacy policy does not apply to,  and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. </p>
				  <h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
				  <p>VidHog uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical  safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.  We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you  transmit to VidHog and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your  transmission of information, VidHog makes commercially reasonable efforts to  ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a  guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or  destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial  safeguards.<br>
				    If VidHog learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify  you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. VidHog  may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where  you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in  writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw  your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using this <a href="http://youtube.com/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
				  <h2>Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</h2>
				  <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that  reason, VidHog does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable  information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Site from persons  under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under  13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Site  at any time or in any manner. If VidHog learns that personally identifiable  information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Site  without verified parental consent, then VidHog will take the appropriate steps  to delete this information.</p>
				  <h2>Special Note to International Users</h2>
				  <p>The Site is hosted in the United States  and is intended for and directed to Users in the United    States. If you are a User accessing the Site  from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations  governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from  United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site,  which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our <a href="http://youtube.com/t/terms">Terms of Use</a>, you are transferring your  personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>
				  <h2>In the Event of Merger, Sale,  or Bankruptcy</h2>
				  <p>In the event that VidHog is acquired by or merged with a third party entity,  we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the  information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger,  acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the  benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles  affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your  personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
				  <h2>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</h2>
				  <p>This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be reflected  by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware  of any changes. In general, we only use your personal information in the manner  described in the Privacy Notice in effect when we received the personal  information you provided. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your  agreement to this Privacy Notice and any future revisions.<br>
				    For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be materially less restrictive  on our use or disclosure of the personal information you have already provided to  us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing such revisions  with respect to such information.<br>
