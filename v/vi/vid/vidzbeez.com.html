<p><strong>What Information Does the  Site Collect?</strong></p>
<p>We collect two types  of data and information from you:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> <strong>the first type is</strong> <strong>Non-Personal Information</strong> - We retain some non-personally identifiable  information (“Non-Personal Information”), such as your approximate  geo-location, browser types, browser extensions, browser language,  referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may  send to us, operating system, your default browser and search providers,  operating system language, and other information relating to your use of VidsBeez  in order to provide you with better services. </p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> <strong>The second type of  information we collect is</strong> <strong>Personal Information</strong> - “Personal  Information” is information that may be of a private or sensitive nature, identifies  or may identify you. Some of the Personal Information is  collected from you when you create an account on the Site and submit your  information and some while you are using the Site. Such information includes your IP address, and  your name, e-mail address and payment method info in case you provide us with  this information (for instance when you open an account or if you approach us through  the “contact us for” option).</p>
<p>We also treat any  Non-personal Information which is specifically connected or linked to any  Personal Information, as long as such connection or linkage exists, as Personal  Information.<strong></strong></p><br>

Non-Personal  Information is collected for research and statistical purposes, for enabling us  to further develop, customize and improve VidsBeez, based on your preferences,  uses and interactions with VidsBeez, and to provide you with the most relevant  additional services and offers. </p>

  <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy </strong></p>
<p>This Policy may be  revised from time to time at our sole discretion, so please check it regularly.  The last revision will be reflected in the "Last modified by"  heading.</p><br>


<p><strong>Cookies Policy</strong></p>
<p>Last modified on 29  January 2014</p>
<p>When visiting the  Site, we send “cookies” to your device. Cookies are small files of code,  usually stored on a user's computer or device, which enable a website to  "personalize" itself for each user and remember his preferences. Most  websites that you visit today will use cookies in one way or another in order  to improve your user experience. Similarly, we have placed cookies on your  computer to improve your experience using VidsBeez. You can change your cookie  settings at any time, but otherwise, we will assume you are OK to continue.</p><br>


<p><strong>What is a Cookie?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are text  strings of information that are downloaded to your computer or device when you are  using VidsBeez. Your web browser then sends these cookies back to the  originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that  recognizes those cookies. You can find more information about cookies at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. <span dir="rtl"> </span></p>
<p>Cookies are very  helpful and can be used for various different purposes. These purposes include  allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your  preferences, and making the interaction between you and the Site quicker and  easier. Cookies are also used to help ensure that the advertisements you see  are relevant to you and your interests.</p><br>


<p><strong>Different Types of Cookies</strong></p>
<p>There are four main  types of cookie we use:</p>
<p><strong>Strictly necessary cookies: </strong>These cookies are  essential in order to enable you to move around and use the features of a  website, or to provide a service requested by you. We do not need to obtain  your consent in order to use these cookies.<strong></strong></p><br>

<p><strong>Functionality cookies: </strong>These cookies allow  the Site to remember choices you make (such as your account name, language or  the region you are in) and provide more personal and enhanced features.&nbsp; For instance, a website may be able to  provide you with more localized information or products by using a cookie to  store information about the region in which you are currently located, remember  changes you have made to text or view size, and other parts of web pages that  you can customize, and provide services you have asked for such as watching a  video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be  anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p><br>


<p><strong>Performance cookies: </strong>These cookies collect  information about how you use the Site, for instance which pages you go to most  often, and if you get error messages from them. These cookies don’t collect  information that identifies you. All of the information collected by these  cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how  the Site works.</p><br>


<p><strong>Targeting cookies or advertising cookies: </strong>These cookies are used  to deliver adverts that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are  also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help  measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed  by advertising networks with the permission of a website’s operator. They  remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with  other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising  cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other  organization. For more information about online behavioral advertising cookies  and online privacy, please see the guide produced by the internet advertising  industry available at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.</p><br>


<p><strong>How to Manage Your Cookie Settings</strong></p>
<p>There are various ways  in which you can manage and control your cookie settings.</p>
<p><strong>You should bear in mind that, by deleting or  blocking cookies, some or all of the websites you visit (or features of them)  may not work properly or as effectively.</strong></p><br>


<p><strong>Turning Off Cookies via Your Web Browser</strong></p>
<p>Most web browsers will  provide you with some general information about cookies, enable you to see what  cookies you’ve got, allow you to delete them all or on an individual basis, and  enable you block or allow cookies for all websites or individually selected  websites. You can also normally turn off third party advertising cookies  separately. </p><br>


<p><strong>Please note that if you adjust your cookie  settings via your web browser then, unless you delete or block each cookie  individually, the changes will apply to all websites that you visit – not just  our Site. You will also need to adjust your cookies on a browser-by-browser  basis.&nbsp; </strong></p><br>

<p><strong>Turning Off Third Party Cookies </strong></p>
<p>You will have the  option of turning off third party targeting/advertising cookies each time you  see an advertisement that has been personalized to you.</p>
<p>Some advertising  networks that partner with us may use cookies to better manage advertising  campaigns, specifically to personalize advertising messages and to impose  frequency caps. </p><br>


<p><strong>Note that the third party listed above may need  to set a cookie in order to remember that their targeting/advertising cookies  should not be assigned to you in the future. If you change or delete your  browser’s cookie file, or change or upgrade your browser or Device, then you  might need to opt out again.</strong></p>
