	<a name="1"></a><h3>I. General Information</h3>
	<p>This website, and the  various content, features and services offered on this website (collectively,  the "Site"), is owned and/or operated by VS Direct Inc. and Vitamin  Shoppe Industries, Inc. (collectively, "The Vitamin Shoppe," "we,"  "us," "our" or similar pronoun). The Vitamin Shoppe is  committed to respecting your online privacy and recognizes your need for  appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable  information ("Personal Information") you share with us. The Vitamin  Shoppe has established this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to let  you know what information we may collect from you on the Site and how we may  use and share that information. Please take a moment to review the terms of our  Privacy Policy. By using the Site, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy  Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not  use the Site. Except as expressly provided herein, this Privacy Policy applies  only to information that we collect on the Site and does not apply to  information which we may collect by other means.</p>
	<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

	<a name="2"></a><h3>II. Personal Information; Changes to Personal Information</h3>
	<p>Personal Information means  any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not  limited to, first and last name, home or other physical address, telephone  number, e-mail address, credit card information, billing address, items you  purchase on the Site and your browsing and buying patterns (to the extent  associated with other Personal Information).</p>
	<p>
	  In general, you can visit  the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information  about yourself. However, in order to make a purchase on the Site, we require  you to register for an account and provide Personal Information. Moreover,  other features or services may require you to provide Personal Information. For  example, we may collect certain Personal Information if you choose to subscribe  to a mailing list, participate in special offers, sweepstakes or other  promotions, or send questions or comments to us via e-mail. Of course, should  you purchase any products on the Site, we will collect Personal Information  from you, which we will use to fulfill your order and for other purposes  consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>
	  We may also collect certain  demographic information (such as gender or age) and information about your  interests and preferences ("preferences information"). In many cases,  such demographic and preferences information is optional. In other cases, such  as online surveys, we collect this information on an anonymous basis. However,  if we link any demographic or preferences information to any Personal  Information, then such demographic and preferences information will be treated  as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>
	  For some features of the  Site, you may be able to submit information about other people. For example, if  you wish to e-mail an article from the Site or send information about an  interesting product to a friend, you will submit your friend's e-mail address,  or if you make a purchase for another person on the Site and want it shipped  directly to that person, you may submit the recipient's name, address and  certain other contact information. The Vitamin Shoppe will use and store any  such information that we collect from you about another person to carry out  your request and for our own internal marketing purposes.</p>
	<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


<a name="3"></a><h3>III. Aggregate Information</h3>
	<p>From time to time, The  Vitamin Shoppe may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about  the use of the Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the  Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they  "click" on. We collect this information through the use of  "cookies" and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in  greater detail below. We collect this information in order to determine which  areas of the Site are most popular and to enhance the Site for visitors. We may  group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use  of the Site to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors,  advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government request. The  Vitamin Shoppe may also group demographic and preferences information and  responses to surveys that we collect from visitors into aggregate data for the  same purposes. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no  way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Site. </p>
	<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

	<a name="4"></a>
	<h3>IV. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies </h3>
	<p>Some of our web pages  utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A cookie is a  small text file that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for  record-keeping purposes. For example, we may use cookies to collect information  about website activity and to maintain your shopping experience in our online  store. We never save credit card information in cookies. Most browsers allow  you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to  remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie,  or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please be aware  that some features of the Site may not function properly or may be slower if  you refuse cookies. Moreover, your ability to complete a purchase may be  compromised without enabling cookies in your Internet browser.</p>
	<p>
	  You may occasionally get  cookies from our advertisers or other third parties with links on the Site (as  in Section XII). We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising  cookies sent by third party ad servers is standard in the Internet industry.</p>
	<p>
	  Tracking technologies may  record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol  (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream  patterns; and dates and times that our Site is accessed. An IP address is a  number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing  the web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" webpages,  automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may link the  information we record using tracking technologies to Personal Information we  collect at the Site for our own internal marketing and advertising efforts.  However, we do not share this Personal Information with third parties. In  addition, we reserve the right to use IP addresses and other tracking  technologies to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce  compliance with the Site's policies, to protect the Site, our customers or  others, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
	<p>
	  The Site may also use a  technology called "tracer tags". These may also be referred to as  "Clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons". This technology allows us to  understand which pages you visit on the Site. These tracer tags are used to  help us optimize and tailor the Site for you and other Site visitors.</p>
	<p>
	  Pop-up blockers or stoppers  prevent extra pop-up windows (usually advertisements) from opening in your  browser. Pop-up blocking software often has negative effects on other  "good" software. If you disable JavaScript pop-up ad windows, you may  also disable other website functionality that uses JavaScript. If you're using  a pop-up blocker that allows you to manage a list of "pop-up  friendly" sites, please refer to your Help files and add the URL of this  Site to your approved list to ensure maximum functionality at the Site.</p>

	<h3>V. How We Use and Share Personal Information</h3>
	<p><strong>How We  May Use Your Information</strong> <br>
With respect to the  Personal Information we collect, we may retain and use that information for  several purposes. For example, we may use your Personal Information in order to  process and fulfill any purchases you make on the Site (including any customary  follow-up or confirmation communications regarding such purchases), process  your catalog requests, enter you into sweepstakes, establish an account for  you, respond to your questions or send e-mails to our mailing list subscribers.  We may also use Personal Information to ensure compliance with our policies and  applicable law. We use your e-mail address as a customer identifier on the  Site. In addition, we may send you periodic communications by e-mail or regular  mail, such as news updates, special promotional offers or information on our  products or services which may be of interest to you. If you later wish to  opt-out of receiving such promotional communications from us at any time,  simply follow the instructions in Section VII. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  we reserve the right to send you certain non-promotional communications  relating to the Site, such as service announcements, e-mail related to  purchases you have made, or similar administrative or transactional messages,  without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</p>
	<p><br>
        <strong>With  Whom We May Share Your Information</strong> <br>
        The Vitamin Shoppe has not and will  not share your Personal Information with third parties for their direct  marketing purposes. However, we may  share and disclose your Personal Information to third parties for other  purposes, as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>
	  We may sometimes use other  businesses to perform certain services for us, such as maintaining the Site and  our mailing lists, processing orders and delivering products, sending postal  mail and providing marketing assistance and data analysis. We may provide  Personal Information to those businesses when that information is necessary for  them to complete a requested transaction or otherwise perform their duties. The  Vitamin Shoppe will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third party  service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on The Vitamin  Shoppe's behalf.</p>
	<p>
	  As The Vitamin Shoppe  develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business  assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved  in such transactions. Thus, in the event that The Vitamin Shoppe or all of its  assets are acquired, customer information would be one of the transferred  assets.</p>
	<p>
	  The Vitamin Shoppe fully  cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our  services for illegal activities, and may in its sole discretion disclose  Personal Information or other information to satisfy any law, regulation,  subpoena, or government request, or in connection with litigation. The Vitamin  Shoppe reserves the right to release Personal Information or other information  about users who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise  in violation of our <a href="/content/en/support/help/legal_info.jsp">Terms  of Use Agreement</a>, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order, if we  believe in our sole discretion that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate  to operate the Site, or to protect the rights or property of The Vitamin  Shoppe, its affiliates, or any of their officers, directors, or employees,  agents, third party content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensors. The  Vitamin Shoppe also reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies  any activities we reasonably believe in our sole discretion to be unlawful.</p>

	<h3>VI.  Your Privacy Rights - California</h3>
	<p>As stated in Section V, we  do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their direct  marketing purposes, regardless of your state of residence.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Also please note that both  VS Direct, Inc. and Vitamin Shoppe Industries, Inc. collect, process and use  Personal Information in connection with the Site and otherwise and they are not  third parties for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

	<a name="7"></a>
	<h3>VII. Privacy Preferences/Opt-Out</h3>
	<p>You can change or update  your Personal Information on the Site by accessing your <a href="/store/en/profile/your_account.jsp">account page.</a></p>
	<p>
	  The Vitamin Shoppe also  offers you control over your privacy preferences through a request submitted at  our <a href="/store/en/support/unsubscribe_form.jsp">Unsubscribe</a> page, where you can request to not receive promotional materials from us. You  may update these preferences at any time. Please allow sufficient time for your  preferences to be processed.</p>
	<p>
	  If you do not want to  receive promotional e-mails from The Vitamin Shoppe, please follow one of the  three options below:</p>
	<p>
	  1. You may opt-out from  receiving promotional e-mail when registering for an account. When providing  your account information, simply uncheck the box that asks whether you would  like to receive e-mail updates about our new features, services and special  offers, and we will not send you any promotional information via e-mail. </p>
	<p>
	  2. You may unsubscribe from  receiving promotional e-mails of certain types (or a company wide unsubscribe)  at any time by using the <a href="/store/en/support/unsubscribe_form.jsp">Unsubscribe</a> page. Click <a href="/store/en/support/unsubscribe_form.jsp">here</a> to  unsubscribe now. Please pay careful attention to the various options for  unsubscribing from our promotional e-mails. You may have the option to  unsubscribe from one or more special interest e-mail lists or unsubscribe from  all promotional e-mails from us. </p>
	<p>
	  3. When you receive an  e-mail from The Vitamin Shoppe, it will contain a link that allows you to stop  the delivery of e-mail messages from us. If you decide to use this opt-out  link, you will no longer receive special offers, valuable coupons, new product  introductions and informational health and wellness newsletters from The  Vitamin Shoppe; however, you will continue to receive non-promotional e-mails  from us, such as order confirmations. </p>

	<h3>VIII. Security  </h3>
	<p>The Vitamin Shoppe intends  to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information  that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. When you  transmit Personal Information from your PC to our servers, your information is  protected by both a "firewall" (a combination of computer hardware  and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information  within our computer network) and industry standard SSL (secure socket layer)  encryption. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be  guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your  Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security  of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be  responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your  Personal Information.</p>
	<p>
	  If you create an account on  the Site, you may be asked to choose a password for your account, in which case  your online account information shall be protected by your password. We  recommend that you do not disclose your password to any other person. You are  responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account,  and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or  account.</p>
	<p> 
	  With respect to general  credit card security online, you can take the steps below to increase the  security of your credit card information: </p>
	<ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>Limit your online shopping to Internet merchants, such       as The Vitamin Shoppe, offering websites equipped with Secure Sockets       Layer (SSL) technology. SSL assists in preventing unauthorized       interception of your sensitive data. </li>
	  </ol>
	<ol start="2" type="1">
      <li>Use a browser, such as Netscape Navigator or Internet       Explorer, that supports SSL. These browsers show a symbol in the status       bar, such as a key or lock, when you are on a site that uses SSL. </li>
	  </ol>
	<p>Credit card information  collected by The Vitamin Shoppe is encrypted through SSL before it is  transmitted over the Internet. </p>

	<h3>X. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
	<p>The terms of this Privacy  Policy may change from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes  to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on the homepage of the Site for a  reasonable period of time after such changes are made that this Privacy Policy  has been updated, and by changing the "Last Updated" date at the top  of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for  any changes. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to  these terms will mean you accept those changes.

	<h3>XI. Third Party Websites</h3>
	<p>Please note that you may  have cookies placed on your computer by third party websites that refer you to  the Site. Although we do not share your Personal Information with these third  party websites, they may be able to link certain non-personally identifiable  information we transfer to them with Personal Information they previously  collected from you. Please review the privacy policies of each website you  visit to better understand their privacy practices. In addition, The Vitamin  Shoppe would like to inform you that anytime you click on links (including  advertising banners), which take you to third party websites, you will be  subject to the third parties' privacy policies.</p>
	<p>
	  While we support the  protection of our customer's privacy on the Internet, The Vitamin Shoppe  expressly disclaims any and all liability for the actions of third parties,  including but without limitation to actions relating to the use and/or  disclosure of Personal Information by third parties. </p>

	<h3>XII. Third Party Ad Servers</h3>
	<p>As of the effective date of  this Privacy Policy, we do not have relationships at the Site with third party  ad server networks. However, we may at some point engage third party ad server  networks to serve advertisements within or in connection with the Site. Because  your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad networks'  servers, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just  as if you had requested a web page from the Site. Please note that if an  advertiser on a third party ad server network asks us to show an advertisement  to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for  example, men ages 18-34 who have viewed sports-related vitamins) and you  respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the  description of the audience they are trying to reach. However, we would only  authorize third party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery  and anonymous targeting. We would not knowingly permit a third party ad server  to collect Personal Information about you. If you want to prevent a third party  ad server and/or third party service provider from sending and reading cookies  on your computer, you must visit each third party ad server network's website  individually and opt out (if they offer this capability). </p>

	<h3>XIII. PowerReviews </h3>
	<p>The Vitamin Shoppe's  product reviews are powered by PowerReviews.com. PowerReviews.com is a third  party providing software enabling our users to post their reviews and comments  about the products available at the Site. When you submit information for a  review at the Site, the information is passed directly to PowerReviews.com and  we do not directly collect such information. PowerReviews.com will review, edit  and conform your review and return the processed information back to us. Upon  receipt, we post the review and information to the Site and associate such  information with Personal Information within our database for our own internal  use. Please note that we do not share your Personal Information with  PowerReviews.com. However, if you choose to include Personal Information with  your review (including your real first and last name, for example), such  Personal Information will be collected by PowerReviews.com and subject to their  privacy practices. The Vitamin Shoppe expressly disclaims any and all liability  associated with PowerReviews.com, including, without limitation, actions  relating to the use and/or disclosure of Personal Information by  PowerReviews.com.</p>
