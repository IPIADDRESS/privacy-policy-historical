The Vitals<sup class="supSml">SM</sup> privacy policy applies to all of the products, services, and websites offered by Vitals or our related, affiliated and/or subsidiary companies (collectively, the "Products and Services").
			
			<br><br>For the purposes of this Vitals<sup class="supSml">SM</sup> privacy policy, "Personal Information" is information that (i) You provide to Vitals and (ii) personally identifies You.

The Excluded Information, however, may be used for the purpose of generating "Aggregated Non-Personal Information," as described below.
