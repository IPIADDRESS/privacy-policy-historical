These interactive Products and Services include, but are not limited to, scheduling appointments with Healthcare Providers. In order to provide you with these interactive Products and Services, We may ask you to provide Personal Information (such as the medical reasons for You scheduling the appointment).

        <p class="p1">Aggregated Non-Personal Information</p>
        <p class="p1">We may disclose Aggregated Non-Personal Information to third parties, including third-party content providers, paid advertisers and licensees of the Products and Services without prior notice to You. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Aggregated Non-Personal Information” is information about some or all of the Users of the Products and Services, but unlike Personal Information, does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable User. Aggregated Non-Personal Information may be formed from Personal Information, but any of the Personal Information used to form the Aggregated Non-Personal Information has been processed to no longer reflect or reference an individually identifiable User.</p>
        <h2>YOUR AD CHOICES AND TRACKING BY THIRD-PARTIES</h2>
        <p class="p1">Vitals permits third-party advertising companies and networks to place paid advertisements that may be visible when You visit, use and/or access the Platform. These companies and networks include, among others, third party ad servers, ad agencies, advertising networks, advertising technology vendors, and research firms. These companies and networks may use Your Other Information to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to You. These third party ad servers and advertisers may use cookies, pixel trackers, or other internet technology to improve the effectiveness and targeting of advertisements to You within the Platform and any other place where that third-party is serving advertisements. The Platform does not have access to, nor control over, advertisers’ or ad service providers’ cookies or how they may be used or how they were collected. In many cases, this information could be used to show You ads based on Your interests on other websites.</p>
        <p class="p1">You have options and choices about the collection and use of information by third-parties on our site:</p>
        <p class="p1">For more information about these third-party ad networks and opting out of tracking, see:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp"><span class="s3">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</span></a></p>

        <h2>EXTERNAL LINKS</h2>
        <p class="p1">This Privacy Policy only applies to the Platform and the Products and Services made available through the Platform. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other websites or mobile applications, including those that may link to or from any part of the Platform or those from which you may be able to download or launch the Platform (collectively, the “External Sites”). Vitals does not endorse and is not responsible for the maintenance or content of any linked External Sites. These External Sites may have their own privacy policies and terms of use, which We encourage You to read. You should contact these External Sites directly if You have any questions about their use of Your information. Vitals is not responsible for any use of Your information, including Your Personal Information, when You use or visit such third party websites, mobile applications and services.</p>
        <h2>INFORMATION SECURITY</h2>
        <p class="p1">We take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of Your Information, including Personal Information stored or maintained on our servers and other systems. These measures include internal reviews of Vitals’ data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to servers and systems where Vitals stores personal data.</p>
        <p class="p1">However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, We cannot guaranty the security of Your Information, including Personal Information.</p>
        <h2>DATA INTEGRITY</h2>
        <p class="p1">Vitals processes Personal Information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Vitals though, must depend on You and our other Users to provide, accurate, complete and current Personal Information and to update or correct their Personal Information whenever necessary. Vitals does not and cannot monitor or pre-screen the Personal Information that You provide for accuracy and completeness but takes reasonable steps to ensure that We accurately process and maintain the Personal Information that You provide.</p>
        <h2>ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2" style="text-decoration: underline">Information You Provide When Registering For a Vitals Account</span></p>
        <p class="p1">You may change or update the e-mail address and password that You provided when You registered for Your Vitals account via the “settings” or “account settings” section of such account. If You registered separately for an account on both the Website and the App, changes or updates to registration information should be made separately on each account. You may terminate Your Vitals account by sending an e-mail with your account termination request at <a href="https://www.vitals.com/feedback"><span class="s3">https://www.vitals.com/feedback</span></a>.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2" style="text-decoration: underline">Information You Store or Access When Using the Products and Services</span></p>
        <p class="p1">When you use the Products and Services, We make good faith efforts to provide You with access to Your Personal Information. You may organize or delete or change certain of the information that is entered or uploaded into Your Vitals account (such as for patients, the names of Your Healthcare Providers, pharmacies, insurance information, emergency contact information, personal health information and related information, and such as for physicians, the address where Your practice is located, Your photograph and Your practice specialty) via the section of Your account where the information is located. Where applicable, We ask individual Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where We provide information access and correction, We provide this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. If you have any questions or want more information about accessing or updating Your Personal Information, please contact Vitals at <a href="https://www.vitals.com/feedback"><span class="s3">https://www.vitals.com/feedback</span></a>.</p>
        <p class="p1">All deletions, changes or updates that you make to Your Personal Information and account termination requests will take effect after We receive and process Your e-mail termination request. Except for deleted information that was stored exclusively on Your mobile device, residual copies of the deleted information, may remain in perpetuity in backup systems.</p>
        <p class="p1">Deleting the App from Your mobile device will not terminate Your Vitals account but will delete any information that You stored through the App by means of taking a photograph with Your mobile device (“Stored Photographic Information”). Terminating Your Vitals account will not delete Stored Photographic Information unless You also delete the App from Your mobile device.</p>
        <p class="p1">Please note though that according to the Terms of Use, Your Submissions to the Platform should not include any “personally identifiable information (other than the name of the Healthcare Providers being reviewed).” This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Information that You may nevertheless include in your Submissions and You may not be able to change or update any such Personal Information included in Your Submissions.</p>
        <h2>CHILDREN</h2>
        <p class="p2">We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through the Platform. If you are under 13, please do not give us any Personal Information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal Information through any website without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
