  <p>
    By using the Bookshelf or Evolve Select application, or by visiting any website operated by VitalSource®,
    including the VitalSource® Store, you accept the information use practices described below.
    These practices are subject to change. Any changes will be posted and will govern the use of information collected after such postings.
    Protecting your privacy is important to us. The following statement will help you understand how VitalSource® Technologies, Inc.
    collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on any of our web sites.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Collection</h3>
  <p>
    Our registration and order forms require users to provide us with contact information, including names and email addresses.
    The forms allow customers to request information or order our products and services.
    We use the information gathered from the forms to contact customers about their orders,
    to send information about our company and products and services, and to keep a record of purchase histories for customer service purposes.
    Go to 'My Account' to view your information and make any changes necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you browse any VitalSource® web site, you do not do so anonymously.
    Personal information is collected. Your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) and domain are logged
    to give us an idea of which parts of our web site you are visiting and how long you are spending there.
    We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. 
    The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using.
    This information is supplied to us by your browser.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Use</h3>
  <p>
    We do not provide any personally identifiable information about you to any third parties without your consent,
    unless those third parties have agreed to our confidentiality provisions and only use the information
    to help us operate the site or we are required by law to disclose such information.
  </p>

  <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
  <p>
    VitalSource® Store does not solicit orders or collect personally identifying information from children under the age of thirteen.
    If we have reason to believe that any personally identifying information has been submitted to us by a child under thirteen,
    we will delete that information as soon as possible and not disclose it to any third party or use it ourselves in any way.
  </p>

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>
    Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information.
    Our secure server software (SSL) is among the best software available today for secure Internet commerce transactions.
    It encrypts your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it is not intercepted as it travels over the Internet.
  </p>

  <h3>vitalsource.com And Other Sites</h3>
  <p>
    You should be aware that when you are on any VitalSource® site,
    you may be directed to other sites operated by our customers or other third-party providers that are beyond our control.
    Some of these sites will have their own separate membership process and privacy policies.
    VitalSource® Technologies, Inc. does not control sites that are operated by others
    and cannot be responsible for the information practices of these sites,
    but it is your responsibility to be aware of where you are on the web.
    It is always a good idea to check the privacy policy and terms of use of any site before offering any of your personal information.
