<p>This Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy explains Vital Source Technologies, Inc.’s (“Vital Source,” also “we,” “our,” and “us”) information practices related to our website at www.vitalsource.com and our products known as Bookshelf, Bookshelf Online, Bookshelf mobile applications, reader software, digital content and other products controlled or owned by Vital Source (the “Products”). You agree to the terms of this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy when you access or use any of the Products or take other actions described below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Information Vital Source collects from you and how it is used</h3>
<a name="information_collected_and_used"></a>
<p>Vital Source collects information from you when you download, access or use any of the Products, register with Vital Source, create a user account on Vital Source’s Bookshelf ereader or visit the Vital Source website, as described further below. This information falls into two categories: personal data and non-personal data (collectively “Information”).</p>
<p>Personal data includes information that identifies you specifically, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, other contact information, employer, academic institution, course information, and credit or debit card numbers.</p>
<p>Non-personal data is anonymous data that does not identify you specifically, such as aggregate data about the number of people who have accessed a particular Product.</p>
<p>You can choose not to provide personal data we may request of you, but, in general, most of the personal data we request is required in order to provide our service and the lack of such personal data will prevent us from doing so. We will collect, use, transfer and disclose your personal data only in ways that are consistent with this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy, but we may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal data for any lawful purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Product Registration and User Forms</h3>
<a name="product_registration"></a>
<p>Vital Source will collect Information from you when you register for an account to use any of the Products or fill out related user forms. This Information will provide basic contact data to Vital Source and enable Vital Source to deliver the correct Products to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Using the Products and making purchases</h3>
<a name="using_products_making_purchases"></a>
<p>Vital Source also collects Information as you use the Products and make Product purchases. This Information includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>facts about your purchases,</li>
<li>how you use the Products,</li>
<li>the specific Products you use,</li>
<li>the specific parts of the Products you use,</li>
<li>any notes you make in the Products or other information you input into the Products while using them,</li>
<li>analytical data created when you view the Products, create new notes, or view previous notes on any device, and</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<a name="cookies"></a>
<p>Vital Source may collect Information about you when you visit the Vital Source website through the use of “cookies.” Cookies are small text files placed in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences.

You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us using the Contacting us details at the end of this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy.</li>

<ul class="legal">
<li>Sharing your Information with third parties</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Vital Source appreciates that you do not want your personal data distributed indiscriminately and we agree not to sell or share this information except as described below.</p>
<ul class="legal">
<li>
<p><a name="academic_institutions"></a><strong>Academic Institutions.</strong>&nbsp;You acknowledge that, where the cost of any Product(s) that would otherwise need to be paid for is covered by the academic or other institution through whom you are studying and you are given a code to redeem for the relevant Product(s) (instead of having to pay yourself), that institution may, as a condition of your being provided with the Product(s) free of charge to you, have agreed with us that Vital Source must share Information related to your use of the relevant Product(s) with the institution. Your institution may wish to see, for example, that you have accessed and used a certain Product or certain of its contents, or spent a certain amount of time using it. This Information may be used to help your institution evaluate your progress and improve your learning. By using one of these codes, you agree to Vital Source sharing usage Information with your institution in this way.</p>
<p><a name="content_owners"></a><strong>Content Owners.</strong>&nbsp;Vital Source may share non-personal data about you and your use of the Products with content owners or licensees that have rights related to the Products that you access (“Content Owners”). Content Owners will use this non-personal data for their own research and tracking purposes, to evaluate Product use and access, to improve Products and related analysis. Vital Source will not reveal your personal data to Content Owners, just anonymous Product usage data that does not identify you specifically.</p>
<p><a name="third_party_affiliates"></a><strong>Third Parties and Affiliates Performing Support Functions.</strong>&nbsp;Vital Source may provide your Information to third-party service providers and to Vital Source affiliates (such as parent companies, subsidiaries, or other companies within our corporate family) that perform support functions related to the Products. The purpose of this sharing may include research, analyzing usage data, providing marketing assistance to Vital Source, processing your credit or debit card payments, providing customer service to you, processing and fulfilling your orders, providing you with Product access, for storage, assisting Vital Source with providing the Products to you, assisting Vital Source in using the Information as described in this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy, and related matters.</p>
<p><a name="disclosures_required_by_law"></a><strong>Disclosures As Required By Law Or To Prevent Harm.</strong>&nbsp;Vital Source reserves the right to disclose Information if it reasonably believes that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such Information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Vital Source, its affiliates or users, the Content Owners or the public, as required or permitted by law.</p>
<p><a name="assignment_of_your_information"></a><strong>Assignment of Your Information.</strong>&nbsp;Vital Source may disclose Information to third parties if Vital Source or a portion of its assets is sold or offered for sale. You grant Vital Source the irrevocable right to transfer ownership of all Information (including personal data) that Vital Source has about you to a third party in connection with the sale of Vital Source or its assets, without payment to you. You acknowledge and agree that the third party may use your Information for the purposes described in this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy and related uses without payment to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Public forums</h3>
<a name="public_forums"></a>
<p>Some of the Products may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and never disclose your personal data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Childrens' privacy</h3>
<a name="childrens_privacy"></a>
<p>You must be 18 years of age or older to create a Bookshelf account. While individuals under the age of 18 may utilize the Products, they may do so only with the involvement, supervision, and approval of their parent or legal guardian. Vital Source does not solicit orders or collect Information from children under the age of 13. If we have reason to believe that any Information has been submitted to us by a child under 13, we will delete that information after taking appropriate actions to prevent further Information submission and as required by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Security</h3>
<a name="security"></a>
<p>Vital Source takes information security very seriously and has taken reasonable measures to keep your Information secure from unauthorized access or disclosure. Vital Source has established the appropriate administrative, technical, physical, electronic and managerial procedures to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and use the Information collected from you in accordance with this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy. Vital Source has security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse, or alteration of your Information. Our secure server software (“SSL”) is among the best software systems available for secure internet payment transactions. It encrypts your payment information to seek to ensure it is not intercepted as it travels over the internet. Submission of Information over the internet, however, is never entirely secure. Despite its reasonable efforts, Vital Source cannot guarantee that unauthorized access or disclosure of Information will never happen. If you have concerns, do not use the Products.</p>
<p>It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal data if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>International transfer of Information</h3>
<a name="international_transfer"></a>
<p>Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process Information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by using any of the Products, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer of your Information outside your country of residence to any country (including the United States) where we have facilities or engage third parties (including but not limited to payment processors, cloud service or other IT providers, and other companies that provide services to us). You understand that the countries to which we may transfer Information may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection as in your country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Third party links</h3>
<a name="third_party_links"></a>
<p>You may find links to third-party websites from any of the Products. These websites may have their own privacy and/or cookies policies, which you should check. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies because we have no control over them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Your rights</h3>
<a name="your_rights"></a>
<p>You have a legal right under the Data Protection Act 1998 to a copy of all the personal data about you held by us. On request, we will provide you with a copy of this personal data. You also have a right to correct any errors in that personal data. As mentioned above, you have a right to prevent the use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy</h3>

Vital Source reserves the right to periodically update this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy at its discretion. Notice of any revisions will be posted to this page and are effective once posted.
