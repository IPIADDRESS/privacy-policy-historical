<p>Protecting your privacy is important to us. The following statement
will help you understand how VitalSource Technologies, Inc.
collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on
any of our web sites.</p>

<a name="f165f3ce7c540255c1985613ff7d55c6"></a><h2>Information Collection
</h2>

<p>When you browse any VitalSource web site, you do not do
so anonymously. Personal information is collected. Your IP address (the
Internet address of your computer) and domain are logged to give us an
idea of which parts of our web site you are visiting and how long you
are spending there. We do not link your IP address to anything
personally identifiable. The only other information automatically
provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are
using. This information is supplied to us by your browser.</p>


<p>When you log-in to any service or forum run or offered by VitalSource, you may
have to identify yourself to use that service. When you registered for
that service we asked for information such as your name, email address,
birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal
interests. For some financial products and services we may also ask for
other information. Once you register with VitalSource and sign in to our
services, you are no longer anonymous to us.</p>
<a name="7e5c338ca0aa1235943b38083c505edd"></a><h2>
Information Use</h2>
<p>The information may be used to improve the content of
our overall Internet site. If you provide us with your email address,
or have done so in the past, we may upon occasion send you email. For
example, we may use information you have given us to provide a service,
measure consumer interest in our various services, or inform you about
new products and services. These offers may be based on information you
provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, or from
information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle.</p>

<a name="789789f51d761149a118056a9f67f102"></a><h1>
VitalSource.com and Other Sites</h1>
<p>You should be aware that when you are on
any VitalSource site, you may be directed to other sites operated by our
customers or other third-party providers that are beyond our control.
Some of these sites will have their own separate membership process and
privacy policies. VitalSource Technologies, Inc. does not control
sites that are operated by others and cannot be responsible for the
information practices of these sites, but it is your responsibility to
be aware of where you are on the web. It is always a good idea to check
the privacy policy and terms of use of any site before offering any of
your personal information.</p>

<a name="5e91f7d3fb651cd0e3367b5ec66fab91"></a><h2>
Security</h2>
<p>VitalSource Technologies, Inc. will use diligent efforts to
protect the security and integrity of the information you provide to us
once it is received on our systems. Unfortunately, when you submit
information about yourself over the Internet, the information may
travel over many systems that are not under the control of Vital Source
Technologies, Inc. The Internet is not 100 percent secure, and others
may intercept the information that you are sending.</p>

<a name="08d806aaefe5789eb0a75ed7ad1700b9"></a><h2>
Your Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
<p>By using this site, you signify your
assent to the VitalSource Technologies, Inc. Privacy Policy. If you do
not agree to this policy, do not use our site. We reserve the right, at
our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this
policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
Your continued use of the Vital Source site following the posting of changes to
these terms means you accept these changes.</p>
