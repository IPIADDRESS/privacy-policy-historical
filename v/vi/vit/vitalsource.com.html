      <p class="u-weight--bold u-push--top">Information VitalSource collects about you</p>
      <p> VitalSource collects information from you when you download, access or use any of the Products, register with VitalSource, create a user account for our Bookshelf e-reader or visit any of our websites, as described further below.
        This information falls into two categories:
        personal data and non-personal data (collectively "Information"). </p>
      <p> Personal data includes information that identifies you specifically or from which you are reasonably identifiable.
        The types of personal data we collect may include your name, address, email address, phone number, other contact information, employer, academic institution, course information, and credit or debit card numbers. </p>
      <p>Non-personal data is anonymous data that does not identify you specifically, such as aggregate data about the number of people who have accessed a particular Product.</p>
      <p> You can choose not to provide personal data we may request of you, but, in general, most of the personal data we request is required in order to provide our service and the lack of such personal data will prevent us from doing so.
        We will collect, use, transfer and disclose your personal data only in ways that are consistent with this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy, but we may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal data for any lawful purpose. </p>
      <p>We collect personal data directly from you as well as from third parties including public sources, our related companies, your organization, your representatives, information service providers, social media and the parties with whom we exchange Information as described here.</p>
      <p class="u-weight--bold u-push--top">Product Registration and User Forms</p>
      <p> VitalSource will collect Information from you when you register for an account to use any of the Products or fill out related user forms.
        This Information will provide basic contact data to VitalSource and enable VitalSource to deliver the correct Products to you. </p>
      <p class="u-weight--bold u-push--top">Using the Products and making purchases</p>
      <p> VitalSource also collects Information as you use the Products, make Product purchases and interact with us.
        This Information includes, but is not limited to: </p>

        Your institution may wish to see, for example, that you have accessed and used a certain Product or certain of its contents, or spent a certain amount of time using it.
