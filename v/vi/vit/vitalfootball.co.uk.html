Through their advertising tag, they collect data from exposed web users, ie. each time a webuser is consulting a site from their network, if their tag is loaded in the page, they can collect various data from this user. They use the information they collect from web users in order to provide their advertising services, to improve their service and for fraud detection.<br>
Below are the specific purposes for which they use the information we collect about web users:<br>
For analytics purposes: They use collected data in order to propose anonymized counters. For example, they calculate the number of impressions per country or city, or the number of impressions per type of browser.<br>
For frequency capping: They use cookies to monitor the frequency of ads displayed to the same user.<br>
To personalize the experience: They use IP address to estimate geolocations and to propose targeted content. For example, for local stores campaigns, they may be asked to target people in the same city or region of this store in order to increase conversion.<br>
For research and development: They are always looking for ways to make their services smarter, faster, secure, integrated and more useful. They use data to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services. For example, they use browser size to check if their ad formats can be displayed evenly on their network and to improve their creative templates to be sure every element will be viewable on screens. They also analyse the correlation between clicks and frequency per user so they can avoid ad blindness.<br>
For safety and security: They use information about web users to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies. For example, IP Address, UUID, xf and use ragent are used to detect invalid traffic such as bots or scripts.<br>
To protect their legitimate business interests and legal rights: When required by law or where they believe it is necessary to protect their legal rights, interests and the interests of others, they use information about web users in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.<br>

<p>What data do they collect?<br>
Events related to user’s activity on their partner’s websites/apps (such as the number of pages viewed,<br>
the products viewed on that website, searches made on the partner’s website, referring/exit pages) ;<br>
Information related to the user device (eg. device type, operating system).<br>
Technical user identifier such as technical IDs of our advertising partners, and Mobile advertising IDs (such as Apple IDFA or GAID).<br>
Non-precise information related to geography and derived from the IP address of connection1 (in order to serve ads only for products and services available in the user country, region or city) ;<br>
Precise geolocation information through the mobile application settings the users have chosen<br>
to share;<br>
Events related to the Teads ad serving such as the number of ads displayed, date/time stamp, and /or the user’s interactions with the ad (eg. action, duration, clickstream).<br>
Third party data providers provide segment interest (eg.socio-demo segment, lifestyle etc…) ;<br>
We do have access to the IP address however, we do not store full IP address for targeting purposes.<br>
The full IP addresses may only be used by Teads for the following purposes:<br>
Fraud detection purposes to help alert us to situations which could not have been caused<br>
by human behavior, such as a massive amount of clicking in a limited period of time;<br>
To be sent to the advertising partner (such as ad exchanges, demand side platforms) buy<br>
and/or sell ad placements.</p>

Analytics: We use collected data for monitoring and reporting the effectiveness of the campaign<br>
delivery to our business partner and for internal business analysis.<br>
Re/Targeting: We use data to filter the ad delivery according to the context (page content, website<br>
name,etc) and the user profile (socio-demographic, geolocation, interest, behavior, etc). This is based on data we do collect directly or from a third party. Teads analyses the products viewed, the search made by the visitor and/or pages visited and may link them with third party data information. This targeting may also be done by the DSP partners. In this case, Teads sends those information in the bid request.<br>
User frequency Capping: We use data to cap the frequency and volume of the same ad delivered to the same user.<br>
Ad Delivery: They transmit collected data for ad delivering and campaign tracking to our business<br>
partners. This does not provide the granularity at the user level.<br>
Delivery Algorithm training: We use data which is anonymized, so as not to be identifiable to a<br>
specific source, and aggregated, so as not to be identifiable to any individual transaction in order to improve our service and technology.<br>
Confidential Data transmitted to 3rd-party: To operate our services, Teads uses partners for analytics, targeting, brand safety, fraud detection, viewability measurement, campaign delivery tracking or others partners that may help them to deliver and measure the quality of our service.<br>
Cross device experience: To provide a consolidated experience through the different devices or<br>
browser environments, they may link the Teads identifiers on the different browsers and environments the user is using.<br>
