    <h1>
        Privacy</h1>
    <h2>
        Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        VitaminL takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously.</p>
    <p>
        This privacy policy, which we adapted from a policy originally provided by <a href="http://www.automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Automattic</a> (<a href="http://www.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WordPress.com</a>), describes how we treat
        the information we collect when you visit and use our websites. Please read this
        notice very carefully.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>
        Like most website operators, VitaminL collects non-personally-identifying information
        of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
        browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
        visitor request. VitaminL’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
        is to better understand how VitaminL’s visitors use its website. From time to time,
        VitaminL may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.
        by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
        VitaminL also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
        Protocol (IP) addresses. VitaminL does not use such information to identify its
        visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances
        that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
        Certain visitors to VitaminL’s websites choose to interact with VitaminL in ways
        that require VitaminL to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and
        type of information that VitaminL gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
        For example, we ask visitors who sign up for VitaminL.tv to provide a username and
        email address. In each case, VitaminL collects such information only insofar as
        is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction
        with VitaminL. VitaminL does not disclose personally-identifying information other
        than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
        information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
        activities.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Aggregated Statistics</h2>
    <p>
        VitaminL may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.
        For instance, VitaminL may monitor the most popular collections on VitaminL.tv.
        VitaminL may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However,
        VitaminL does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
        below.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
        VitaminL discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
        that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on VitaminL’s behalf
        or to provide services available at VitaminL’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed
        not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
        organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using VitaminL’s websites,
        you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases
        we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information
        is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if VitaminL
        or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that
        VitaminL goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one
        of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge
        that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of VitaminL may continue to
        use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy.
        Otherwise, VitaminL will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
        above, VitaminL discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information only when required to do so by law, or when VitaminL believes in good
        faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
        of VitaminL, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user
        of a VitaminL website and have supplied your email address, VitaminL may occasionally
        send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
        keep you up to date with what’s going on with VitaminL and its products. If you
        send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
        we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your
        request or to help us support other users. VitaminL takes all measures reasonably
        necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction
        of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should also be aware that if you submit information to “chat rooms,” “forums”
        or “message boards” such information becomes public information, meaning that you
        lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures
        may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer,
        and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
        VitaminL uses cookies to help VitaminL identify and track visitors, their usage
        of VitaminL websites, and their website access preferences. VitaminL visitors who
        do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers
        to refuse cookies before using VitaminL’s websites, with the drawback that certain
        features of VitaminL’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Ads</h2>
    <p>
        Ads appearing on any VitaminL websites may be delivered to users by advertising
        partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your
        computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information
        about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to,
        among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of
        most interest to you. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by VitaminL
        and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Links to Third Party Sites</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy only applies to information collected by VitaminL. This privacy
        policy does not apply to the practices of companies that VitaminL does not own or
        control, or employees that VitaminL does not manage. A VitaminL website may contain
        links to third party websites. Any information you provide to, or that is collected
        by, third-party sites may be subject to the privacy policies of those sites, if
        any. We encourage you to read such privacy policies of any third-party sites you
        visit. It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable
        restrictions on the disclosure of your personally-identifying information, and VitaminL
        and its affiliates shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your personally-identifying
        information by any third party.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Security</h2>
    <p>
        All non-personally-identifying information, potentially personally-identifying and
        personally identifying-information described above is stored on restricted database
        servers.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Choice/Opt-out</h2>
    <p>
        If we ever send you information by email concerning new products, services or information
        that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an email address by
        which you may request no further notices.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Address Book Data</h2>
    <p>
        Any external address book data (email contacts, etc.) that a user voluntarily gives
        VitaminL access to will only be used for the described feature (looking up friends,
        etc.), and will not be stored or repurposed.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>
        Although most changes are likely to be minor, VitaminL may change its privacy policy
        from time to time, and in VitaminL’s sole discretion. VitaminL encourages visitors
        to frequently check this page for any changes to its privacy policy. Your continued
        use of this site after any change in this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance
        of such change.
