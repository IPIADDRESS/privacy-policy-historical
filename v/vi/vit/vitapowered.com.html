        <b>Safe
    Harbor Data Privacy Notice</b></span><b><br>
    <br>
    Performance Assessment Network, Inc. </b>("<i><b>pan</b></i>")
adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles published by
the U.S. Department of Commerce (the "Safe Harbor Principles")
with respect to personal information (as defined below)
it receives from the European Union.<br>
<br>
This notice outlines our general policy and practices
for implementing the Safe Harbor Principles, including
the type of information to which this notice applies,
how we use personal information, and the choices individuals
have regarding our use of, and their ability to correct,
that personal information. If there is any conflict
between the policies in this notice and the Safe Harbor
Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles will govern. <br>
<br>
This notice applies to all personal information we
handle, including on-line (except as noted below),
off-line, and manually processed data. For purposes
of this notice, "personal information" means data that:<br>
     </p>
    <ul>
      <li>is transferred from the European
            Union to the United States;</li>
      <li>is recorded in any form; and</li>
      <li>is about, or pertains to, a specific
            individual who is identified in, or is identifiable
            from, the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>"Sensitive information" is a subcategory of
        personal information. Sensitive information
        is defined as personal information specifying
        medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic
        origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
        beliefs, trade union membership, or the sex
        life of the individual. Sensitive information
        also includes personal information received
        from a third party where the third party treats
        and identifies it as sensitive. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Safe Harbor Principles Regarding Personal Information<br>
        </b><i>Notice and Choice<br>
        </i><br>
  We notify individuals about the personal information
  we collect from them, how we use it, and how to contact
  us with privacy concerns. We obtain personal information
  only as permitted by the Safe Harbor Principles or
  with the consent of the individual affected. Consent
  for personal information to be collected, used, and/or
  disclosed in certain ways may be required in order
  for an individual to obtain or use our services.
  To the extent permitted under the Safe Harbor, we
  reserve the right to process personal information
  in the course of providing professional services
  to our clients without the knowledge of individuals
  involved.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Disclosures and Transfers<br>
  </b>We do not disclose personal information to third
  parties, except when one or more of the following
  conditions is true:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We have the individual's permission
            to make the disclosure;</li>
      <li>The disclosure is permitted by law
            or mandatory professional standards;</li>
      <li>The disclosure is reasonably related
            to the sale or other disposition of all or
            part of our business or assets;</li>
      <li>The personal information to be disclosed
            is publicly available;</li>
      <li>The party to whom the disclosure
            is made controls, is controlled by, or is
            under common control with <b><i>pan</i></b>;</li>
      <li>The disclosure is reasonably necessary
            for the establishment or maintenance of legal
            claims; or</li>
      <li>The disclosure is to persons or
            entities for whom we are providing services,
            provided the disclosure is consistent with
            the purpose for which the personal information
            was obtained.</li>
      
    </ul>
    <p>We
        will comply with the Safe Harbor Principles
        with respect to disclosures of sensitive information,
        including, when applicable, obtaining the explicit
        consent of the individual prior to disclosing
        sensitive information to a third party or using
        sensitive information for purposes other than
        those for which it was originally collected
        or subsequently authorized by the individual.
        Transfers of information permitted under this
        notice, either to third parties or within <b><i>pan</i></b>,
        include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction
        to another, such as transfers to and from the
        United States of America.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Data Security, Integrity, and Access<br>
        </b>We employ physical, electronic, and managerial
  measures, including education and training of our
  personnel, designed to provide the personal information
  in our possession with reasonable protection from
  accidental loss or destruction, improper use, alteration,
  or disclosure. Personal information collected or
  displayed through a Web site is protected in transit
  by industry standard encryption processes. However,
  we cannot guarantee the security of personal information
  accessible on or transmitted via the Internet.<br>
  <br>
  We process personal information in ways compatible
  with the purpose for which the personal information
  was collected, or as otherwise authorized by the
  individual. To the extent necessary for such purposes,
  we take reasonable steps to make sure that personal
  information is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise
  reliable with regard to its intended use.<br>
  <br>
  If an individual becomes aware that personal information
  we maintain about that individual is inaccurate,
  or if an individual would like to update or review
  his or her personal information, the individual may
  contact us using the contact information below. As
  a security precaution, we may request that the individual
  provide identifying information such as name, address,
  birth date, and/or social security number. In addition,
  we may limit or deny access to personal information
  where providing such access would be unreasonably
  burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or
  as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement.
  In some circumstances, we may charge a reasonable
  fee, where warranted, for access to personal information. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Accountability and Enforcement<br>
  </b>We established a program to monitor our adherence
  to the Safe Harbor Principles and to address questions
  and concerns regarding our adherence. This program
  will include a statement, at least once a year, signed
  by our authorized representative, verifying our adherence
  to the Safe Harbor Principles. We encourage interested
  persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact
  information below. <br>
  <br>
  With respect to any dispute relating to this notice
  that cannot be resolved through our internal processes,
  we will cooperate with competent European Union data
  protection authorities and comply with the advice
  of such authorities. In the event that we or such
  authorities determine that we did not comply with
  this notice, we will take appropriate steps to address
  any adverse effects and to promote future compliance. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Amendment</b><br>
  We may amend this notice from time to time by posting
  a revised notice on this Web site, or a similar Web
  site that replaces this Web site. If we amend the
  notice, the new notice will apply to personal information
  previously collected only insofar as the rights of
  the individual affected are not reduced. So long
  as we profess to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles,
  we will not amend this notice in a manner inconsistent
  with the Safe Harbor Principles.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Information Subject to Other Policies<br>
  </b>We are committed to following the Safe Harbor
  Principles for all personal information, as that
  term is defined herein. Other information we receive
  may be subject to policies that may differ in some
  respects from the policies set forth in this notice.
  Certain of our Web sites have their own privacy policies
  that apply specifically to those Web sites. Those
  policies may be accessed through the Web sites in
  question. Information relating to present or former <b><i>pan</i></b> personnel
  is subject to our policies concerning personnel data
  privacy, which are available to present and former <b><i>pan</i></b> personnel
  upon request. Information obtained from or relating
  to clients or former clients is further subject to
  the terms of any privacy commitment made to the client,
  any agreements with the client, and/or any applicable
  laws and professional standards. </p>
