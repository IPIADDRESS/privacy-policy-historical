		Vitacost.com, Inc. is committed to your privacy. We disclose our information practices below and we agree to notify you of:
		</p><ol>
			<li>What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through www.vitacost.com.</li>
			<li>The organization collecting the information.</li>
			<li>How the information is used.</li>
			<li>With whom the information may be shared.</li>
			<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.</li>
			<li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under vitacost.com control.</li>
			<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
		</ol>
		If you have questions or concerns regarding these statements, you should contact <a href="/LandingPage/ContactUsForm.aspx">Customer Support</a> by email.
	<p></p>
	
	<p class="txtB">
		At Vitacost.com we protect your privacy as if it were our own. We use the information you provide to us for six purposes only: 
		to process your order(s), to reply to your questions, provide our newsletter via email, to provide our print catalog via postal mail, 
		to facilitate a transaction you chose to enter into with our third party partner(s) and to incorporate your feedback into improvements to 
		our Web site. We will not give, sell, or rent your personal information, including email address, or specific account activity to anyone 
		for any reason without your prior consent except as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights 
		and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		</p><div class="pHdr">Our Secure Ordering.</div>
		Vitacost, Inc. uses Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure the privacy of your personal information. When you make an online purchase, 
		our advanced security technology encrypts and scrambles your personal data (including your name, delivery and e-mail addresses and credit card 
		number) before it is sent to us, making it virtually impossible for anyone other than Vitacost, Inc.  to read it. To further protect your 
		information, we utilize state of the art back-end systems and restrict employee access to your information. Unless specifically authorized 
		by you, no outside party is able to access or receive any of your personal customer information.
	<p></p>

	<p>
		To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left or right corner 
		of your browser, or to the right of the location bar in newer browsers. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), 
		the SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the location line or your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, 
		the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https." Some browser versions and 
		some firewalls do not permit communication through a secure server like the ones we use at Vitacost, Inc.. If for any reason you cannot 
		access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1-800-381-0759. It is important for you to protect 
		against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Vitacost, Inc. 
		wants you to feel completely comfortable. If you have more questions about our security systems, or feel more comfortable ordering by phone, 
		please call 1-800-381-0759 and we will be happy to help you.
	</p>

	<p>
		</p><div class="pHdr">Credit Card Fraud Protection.</div>
		All major credit card companies protect cardholders against fraud, subject to a $50 deductible. Vitacost.com will protect you for this 
		$50 portion in the highly unlikely situation that you ever encounter an inappropriate charge involving our company.
	<p></p>

	<p>
		</p><div class="pHdr">Optional Phone Ordering.</div>
		If you are still skeptical about placing your order online, you may place your order over the phone at 1-800-381-0759 or via fax at 
		1-800-347-6898  during customer service hours: Monday through Thursday from 9am-9pm EST; Friday from 9am-6pm EST and Saturday from 10am-3pm EST.
	<p></p>

	<p>
		</p><div class="pHdr">Information We Collect.</div>
		In designing our website, we started with the simple belief that customer service is our number one priority. Therefore the customer 
		information we collect is used to enhance our services to you, our customer.
	<p></p>

	<p>
		<b>When you visit our website, we collect non-personal information about your visit.</b> We collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, 
		and we log the length of time of your visit and the number of times you visit and purchase from us. We assign you a unique internal 
		identifier to help keep track of your future visits. We use this information to gather aggregate demographic information about our visitors, 
		and we use it to personalize the information you see on our website and the emails you receive from us (should you grant us permission to 
		send to you). We keep this information for our internal use; we do not share it with others. This information is in no way tied to your 
		personal information, including your email address.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Our Web site uses cookies to store information between users' visits to our site and for the duration of the visit, also known as 
		a session.</b> Cookies are a mechanism to remember information about a visitor when he or she navigates from one Web page to another. 
		Our Web site uses cookies to hold users' unique session identifiers, allowing our Web server to serve correct information back to the user. 
		Such information includes the user's shopping cart items, or whether he or she is logged in when requesting to view or modify personal 
		information, including your email address, which may have been stored in our database in the past. Our Web site cookies do not hold any 
		personal identifiable information. Disabling or rejecting cookies will prevent users from adding items to the cart and checking out; 
		however, standard browsing on our Web site does not require cookies.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Vitacost.com uses tracking technologies</b> to send anonymous information about your browsing habits to a third party company. 
		Links in our email communications to recipients are tracked via Web Beacons once you land on our website. Web Beacons appear on our 
		website as 1x1 transparent images which transmit information such as your operating system, browser, resolution, geographical location, 
		products ordered, and order total. This information is used to help our webmasters and marketers understand the behavior of visitors to 
		our website and understand the effectiveness of online and email messages. Your information is submitted anonymously, and no sensitive or 
		personally identifiable information is transmitted.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>When you subscribe to our newsletters, Vitacost.com, Inc. asks you for contact information</b> (your name and email address). 
		When you sign up for our newsletters we use your name and email address to send you our health newsletters and to inform you of sales 
		and special offers. When you submit a product review on our website, you are required to log into your customer account. Your comments, 
		first name, city, and state will be displayed. However, no information that would allow others to contact you will be disclosed by 
		Vitacost.com. Your information will be used for no other purpose than to allow you to submit product reviews.
	</p>

	<p>
		</p><div class="pHdr">Recommend product to a friend.</div>
		The information collected (friend's name and email address) is used to send a one time only email to the friend letting them know about the 
		product that the user recommends.
	<p></p>

	<p>
		<b>If you place an online order, our secure order form requests contact, billing, and financial information</b> (such as your credit 
		card numbers for purchases). Contact information from the order form (email address, name, billing and shipping address, and phone number) 
		is used to send orders and information about our company to you. Your contact information, including email address, is also used to get 
		in touch with you should we have questions regarding your order or should we need to notify you of the status of your order. And yes, 
		you can opt not to get email from us, as described in the opt-out section below. The credit card information we collect is used to bill 
		you for products you purchase, and if you provide prior consent, this information may also be shared with a third party partner. 
		For your convenience, your information including credit card and order history is stored on a secure server that allows you to 
		reorder by entering your email address and password. You may also place a autoship order that will allow you to receive products on a 
		regular basis without the need to reenter that order every time. You may cancel this order at anytime by sending an email to 
		<a href="/LandingPage/ContactUsForm.aspx">Customer Support</a> or calling 1-800-381-0759. You will automatically be registered to 
		receive our weekly newsletter unless you opt-out at the time of purchase. You may opt-out at any later time by following the 
		unsubscribe instructions in the newsletter or sending an email to <a href="mailto:newsletter@vitacost.com">newsletter@vitacost.com</a> 
		with the word UNSUBSCRIBE followed by your email address in the subject of the email (example: UNSUBSCRIBE youremail@emailaddress.com).

logo frames the Web page you are visiting.</li>
			<li>We use third-party intermediaries. When you purchase from us, we send your credit card information, name, and billing address to credit card companies for verification and to authorize your purchase.</li>
			<li>We use outside shipping companies to fulfill orders. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information, including email address, for any other purposes.</li>
			<li>We provide certain third party offers for your consideration. Should you choose to place an order with one of these partners, in some cases we will share certain information, including email address, necessary to facilitate your transaction with them. We will always ask 
for your consent prior to sharing your information with anyone.</li>
			<li>Vitacost.com handles the sending of order related and customer service related messages internally, as well as advertising related emails. Vitacost service providers do not retain nor use your personal information, 
including your email address for any other purpose except to provide the service on our behalf.</li>

		</p><div class="pHdr">Our affiliates may have access to transaction-level data.</div>
		Our third-party affiliate program offers a feature that may allow a small number of selected affiliates to gain access to individual user 
		transaction information that originates from links on their websites. These affiliates generally include, but are not limited to, 
		rebate sites, member sites, charity fund-raising sites, school fund-raising sites, and association sites. To properly track and credit the 
		customer's transaction, these sites may give each of their members a unique code, which will uniquely identify the member or the member's 
		organization. This code is activated only when the customer links directly from the affiliate site to Vitacost.com, Inc. Any transactions made at 
		Vitacost.com, Inc. while the code is active will be reported back to the affiliate. Vitacost.com, Inc. never passes on personal data as part of 
		this feature. We will provide only the date of the transaction, the amount of the transaction, and the product purchased. To further protect 
		the privacy of our customers, we require all affiliates requesting this feature to sign a statement promising to inform users beforehand of 
		any such data collection, and to guarantee that any data collected will be used solely to reward users (or their selected charities) for their 
		purchases. If you are concerned about having your purchase tracked in this manner, you may avoid it by visiting Vitacost.com, Inc. directly 
		(without linking from an affiliate site). If the affiliate site has not made its tracking procedures clear to you, please notify us by e-mail.

		<b>We occasionally run our own online surveys</b> and we ask visitors for contact information (such as email address) and demographic

		You may opt-out of the survey and also opt-out of any future mailings at the time of the survey. The demographic information is used to 
		learn more about the types of people who visit our site. This information is not shared with any other parties currently. We reserve the 
		right to share this information with other parties in the future in an aggregated format that would not disclose any personally 
		identifiable information.
