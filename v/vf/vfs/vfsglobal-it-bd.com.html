            <p>Italian Visa &amp; Legalization Application Centre is a service provided 
              for the Embassy of Italy in Bangladesh by VFS Bangladesh Private 
              Limited ("VFS"). <br>
              <br>
              VFS provides logistic services to visa applicants seeking visa to 
              enter Italy and is only responsible for the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li> To receive from an applicant his/her passport, completed visa 
                form, Legalization Documents &amp; supporting documentation (collectively, 
                the "Documents") and the applicable fees. </li>
              <li> To submit the Documents to the Embassy of Italy in Dhaka on 
                behalf of the applicant. </li>
              <li> To collect the relevant Documents back from the Embassy of 
                Italy after completion of all formalities, and return the relevant 
                Documents back to the applicant by hand delivery to the applicant. 
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Other Conditions: </b><br>
              Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, the Embassy of Italy 
              in Dhaka reserves the right to ask for further documentation and 
              to refuse the visa application. <br>
              <br>
              In certain cases, instead of the aforesaid procedure, the Embassy 
              of Italy will hand over the relevant Documents to the Applicants 
              directly. In such cases, VFS shall not be responsible for any loss 
              or damage to the Documents, in any manner whatsoever.<br>
              <br>
              It must be noted that the grant or refusal of the Italian visa is 
              at the sole discretion of the Embassy of Italy and VFS is neither 
              involved in the process nor is liable or responsible in any manner 
              whatsoever for any delay in processing or grant or rejection of 
              the visa application of any applicant by the Embassy of Italy. <br>
              <br>
              VFS takes every reasonable precaution while handling the Documents 
              of applicants. However, VFS shall not be responsible in any manner 
              whatsoever to the applicant for any Documents which are lost in 
              transit by accident, theft, natural calamities (act of god) or any 
              other reason outside the control of, or not arising out of a willful 
              default of, VFS. <br>
              <br>
              The applicant agrees and accepts that VFS neither controls the Embassy 
              of Italy in nor does it control or operate the services provided 
              by them. Hence, VFS will not be liable or responsible in any manner 
              whatsoever for the loss or damage of applicant's Documents due to 
              any default on the part of the Embassy of Italy. <br>
              <br>
              The applicant agrees and accepts that the courier acceptance and 
              delivery service through which the Documents are returned to the 
              applicants by VFS is operated by a third-party. VFS does not control 
              or operate any courier company, neither does it control or operate 
              any facility or service provided by the courier company. VFS disclaims 
              any and all liability for any loss or damage caused to the applicant 
              in the event that his/her Documents are delayed/ misplaced/ lost/ 
              damaged by the courier company, whether such delay/ misplacement/ 
              loss/ damage result from negligence, accident or any other cause. 
              In no event shall VFS and/or its representatives be liable for any 
              direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential damages 
              or any damages whatsoever due to such delay/ misplacement/ loss/ 
              damage of the Documents, including the applicant's passport. Without 
              prejudice to the aforesaid, VFS's and/or its representatives sole 
              and exclusive liability in case a passport is lost or damaged in 
              transit, is limited/restricted to the reimbursement of the amount 
              of fees charged by the Department of Passport &amp; Immigration, Government
