<div class="underlinks">
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        At Vendo we are committed to honouring the privacy of our users and suppliers. This privacy policy covers the processing of personally identifiable information shared through Vendo's services in accordance with the EU Personal Data Protection Act.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        <strong>What information does Vendo receive and how do we use it?</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        When you use the Vendo services we ask that you give us your first and last name, address (Country - if applicable), phone number, e-mail address and financial information such as your bank account number and /or credit card number, whichever is selected by you as the preferred kind of payment. This information facilitates us to deliver your access rights. In order to fulfill our roll as an access rights provider, Vendo furthermore receives from suppliers information about the online venue you will access. Furthermore Vendo has to share the information provided by you with your bank/credit card company. In short Vendo uses your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of rendering the Vendo services. Vendo shall not process these data any further and/or keep this data in any database longer than strictly necessary for these purposes.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        <strong>Security</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        <strong>It is Vendo's goal to provide its customers with a safe and secure shopping experience.</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        A transaction by credit card with Vendo is in general even safer than payment by credit card via the e-mail or telephone. Vendo's secure server encrypts all your personal information (including name and address) so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the internet. When you enter this information it is captured on a page that uses the Secure Socked Layer (SSL) protocol by default. In order to be certain that you are connected to a real Vendo payment window, you can click on the little lock that appears at the bottom of the window as soon as the connection has been made secure. Then check whether you are connected to the a Vendo server. Vendo makes use of a 128 bits Thawte certificate for the payments pages and we use 3Des encryption for the credit card authorisation.
