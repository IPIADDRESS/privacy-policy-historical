        <p>APPLICABILITY OF PRIVACY POLICY</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>This privacy policy applies to all information we collect though our web and mobile applications from Venmo users, including you. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Venmo does not own or control, or to individuals that Venmo does not employ or manage.</p>
        <p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.</p>

        <p>When you visit the website or use one of our mobile applications, we collect your IP address, and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. We also may collect certain geo-location information. If you do not agree to our collection of this information, you may not be able to use our Service.<br>If you open an account, we collect the following information from you:</p>
        <ul>

          <li class="legal">Identification Information - your name, street address, email address, date of birth, and SSN (or other governmental issued verification numbers).</li>

            Additionally, another Venmo user may mention you in a transaction in which you are not a party to by “tagging” your username in a transaction note.

You may shut off notifications about these mentions in the privacy controls section.
