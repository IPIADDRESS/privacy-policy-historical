<ol type="1">
<li>Modification of Privacy Policy.  We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and without prior notice, by posting an amended Privacy Policy that is always accessible by clicking on the "Legal" link on this site's home page.

<li>Privacy Statement.  Visual Engineering, Inc.  ("VE"), operates this web site.  All references to "we", "us", "this web site" or "this site" shall be construed to mean VE.   VE understands that visitors to this web site are concerned about the privacy of information. The following describes our privacy policy, including our policy regarding personally identifiable information that we collect through this web site about individuals who use or visit this website.  It also identifies the categories of third party persons or entities with which we share the collected personally identifiable information.</li> 

<li>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information ("PII").  When an individual visits this web site and registers to receive certain benefits,  we may collect certain categories of personally identifiable information.  The information we collect may vary depending on the benefits selected by the registrant and the information provided by the registrant.  For example, we may collect the following categories of personally identifiable information: name, physical address, an email address, phone number, occupation, and account information.</li>

<li>Sharing of PII: General Policy.  We do not rent, sell or share PII with you or nonaffiliated companies, except with your consent or as described below.</li>

<li>Sharing of PII: Affiliates.  Unless prohibited by law, we may use and share PII within any companies that may legally affiliated with us (such as, for example, any parent, subsidiary, or brother or sister entity) for purposes of providing service and account maintenance, to help us design and improve products and services, and to offer products and services that may be of interest to you.</li>

<li>Sharing of PII: Third-Party Service Providers.  When you submit your PII on this site, we reserve the right to share it with a reputable third party that provides outsourced services for us ("Third Party Service Providers").  These Third Party Service Providers may include, for example, companies that (i) host, manage, and service our web servers, software and systems, (ii) provide business, data processing, or marketing services, and (iii) provide payment processing, fulfillment, and/or shipping services.  Further, all such Third Party Processors are contractually bound by us to keep the information confidential, and all information provided to or accessible by Third Party Service Providers is required to be used by them only for purposes of the service they are providing for this site.</li>

<li>Sharing of PII: Purchase or Sale of Businesses.  We continually looks for ways to improve our business.  One such way of improving our business might be to buy or sell a company.  If we buy or sell a business, databases containing PII will likely be transferred as part of the sale.  If we buy a business, we will honor the requests of that business' former customers regarding their personally identifiable information.  If in connection with a sale there will be material changes to the way personally identifiable information is being used, affected consumers will be notified via e-mail and will be given the opportunity to opt-out.</li> 

<li>Sharing of PII: Legal Process.  We reserve the right to share PII with third parties in response to a subpoena, to prevent fraud, to comply with an inquiry by a government agency or other regulator, or as necessary for other legal purposes.</li>

Cookies enable the site to "remember" who you are so that you can get around it easier and more efficiently.  Cookies may allow you to access secured information, conduct secured transactions, and take advantage of promotional opportunities.

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer.  A Referrer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from.  System information includes time of access, the type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed of your computer.  We reserve the right to use this "traffic data" purposes of identifying broad demographic trends and for improving the content of this web site.
