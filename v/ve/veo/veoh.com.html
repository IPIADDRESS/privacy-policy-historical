        <p>Veoh is committed to protecting your privacy when you use Veoh, which is comprised of the Veoh website, currently located at www.veoh.com and the Veoh client, a downloadable application that enables users to view content. This Privacy Policy informs you of the types of information we collect about you, how that information is used, whether and to whom we disclose it, and the choices you have regarding your personal information. </p>
        <p>It is very important that you read and understand our Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms set out in our Privacy Policy, please do not use Veoh.</p> 
		<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any revisions will be effective upon posting the new Privacy Policy on the Veoh website at <a href="http://www.veoh.com/static/corporate/privacyPolicy.html">http://www.veoh.com/static/corporate/privacyPolicy.html</a>. We will advise you that changes have been made by posting a notice on our website or otherwise.  Your visit to or  use of Veoh constitutes your acceptance of the terms of our Privacy Policy.  You are advised to consult our Privacy Policy regularly for any changes (revisions will be reflected by the "last update" notation below).</p>
       <h2> <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding Veoh's policies or practices relating to privacy, please direct them to <a href="mailto:privacy@veoh.com">privacy@veoh.com</a>.</p> </h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on October 7, 2008.</p>
      <p class="corpSubHeader">Collection of Information</p>
        <p>While using Veoh you may gather information on our website, view, publish and download video or other content, share, comment on or post information, subscribe to one of our services, join groups, or participate in other activities available throughout Veoh.  In doing so, we may collect certain information about you. </p>

		<p>We may automatically collect certain aggregated data regarding your use of Veoh, like the number of users and frequency and manner of usage of Veoh. We may also collect aggregated information regarding the use of our subscription-based services, such as the extent to which certain features are used. Aggregated information is anonymous, statistical information that reflects the scope of our user base, sales, customer patterns and related site information. In addition, certain non-personally identifiable information is collected by Veoh and our third-party advertising providers (such as, for example, DoubleClick and other providers ) during your use of Veoh and in serving advertisements to our website, including, for example, the number of times you have viewed an advertisement (but not your name, address, or other personal information).</p>  
		
		<p>We may also use cookies to track and understand the traffic on our website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that our website places onto your computer's hard drive.

We use cookies to collect and store some information about you, such as the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the date and time you access our website and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our website.</p> 
		
		<p>Third party advertisements displayed on or in connection with the Veoh website may also contain cookies set by such advertisers. We do not control these cookies and users of Veoh should check the privacy policy of such advertisers to understand whether and how it uses cookies.</p>

			<p>We may also use information about you and your activities on our website to customize your experience and to customize the content or features of Veoh and for the purpose of tailoring the online advertising you may encounter.  </p>
			
			<p>You may elect to hide your site activity or profile information so that it will not be seen by other users.</p>
			
			<p>We may use your personally identifiable information to fulfill your requests for services, to communicate with you about your account, to support your online activities, and to respond to your questions. We may use your personally identifiable information to notify you of changes to Veoh, the Terms of Use and/or Privacy Policy.

      <p class="corpSubHeader">Disclosure of Information      </p>
			<p>We may share aggregated statistical information and profile information about users of Veoh with third-parties, including our distributors, vendors, advertisers actual and potential customers, business partners and third-parties that offer products or services for use with Veoh.

		<ol>
			<li>Your name or screen name may be available through search indexes.</li>
			<li>As necessary to third parties who perform services for us in operating and marketing Veoh, included but not limited to the monitoring of user behavior on our website and the processing of payments for products or services. </li>
			<li>If you obtain the Veoh client bundled with product(s) from a third-party company, we may share some of your personally identifiable information (but not your credit card information) with that company. If we share your personally identifiable information with such a company, that company's privacy policy will govern its use of your information. </li>
			<li>We may be obliged or deem it necessary or appropriate to disclose your information in certain special situations. These situations include: in response to legal process such as a court order or subpoena; to prevent or combat fraud; as required by federal or state law; enforcement of our Terms of Use; and protection of the rights, property or safety of Veoh, our users or others. </li>
			<li>We may disclose your information in connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of our company and to parents, subsidiaries or affiliates of Veoh. 
			If you access any third-party applications, follow links from the Veoh website to another website, or view Veoh from another website, the information you disclose may no longer be covered by this Privacy Policy.  You are encouraged to check whether other privacy policies will govern before you release any personal information.</li>
		</ol>
      <p class="corpSubHeader">Security      </p>
		<p>Veoh is committed to taking appropriate measures to protect your privacy against unauthorized disclosures. Veoh uses a variety of secure techniques designed to protect your information. </p>

		<p>While we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that Internet security technology rapidly changes. As such, we cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ today can protect your personal information from the threats of tomorrow, or that our security measures are failsafe and not subject to circumvention or unauthorized intrusion. You should also be aware that, despite our best efforts, factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of data. </p>
      <p class="corpSubHeader">Young Children      </p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.

      <p class="corpSubHeader">Opt-Out      </p>
        <p>Veoh provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain communications from us regarding products and services in which you may be interested. If you do not opt-out at the time you provide information, but choose to opt-out later, send an email to optout@veoh.com or click <a href="mailto:optout@veoh.com">here</a> to send an email indicating that you no longer wish to receive such communications. Please provide your name and physical and/or email address(es) at which you are receiving the unwanted communications.  We reserve the right to send you administrative message, service announcements, and other similar communications without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.  </p>

      <p class="corpSubHeader">Notice for Users Outside of the United States      </p>
        <p>You should be aware that the United States and other countries have not harmonized their privacy regulations. Because Veoh is intended specifically for users in the United States, we have written our Privacy Policy to satisfy United States regulations and make no representations regarding the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions. By using Veoh, you agree to the level of privacy protection set out in our Privacy Policy. </p>
