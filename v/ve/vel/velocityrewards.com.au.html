<p> Velocity Rewards Pty Ltd ACN 116 089 448 (“we”, “us”, and “our”) recognises the importance of privacy issues. This Privacy Policy briefly tells you how we manage the personal information that we collect, use and disclose and how to contact us if you have any queries. This Privacy Policy does not cover personal information collected or held by us about our employees and is to be read subject to any overriding provisions of law or contract. </p>
<p><strong> Background </strong></p>
<p> Personal information is information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion. </p>
<p> There are special provisions which apply to the collection of some personal information which is known as sensitive information. This includes health information and information about a persons' race, ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of political, professional or trade associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences and criminal history. </p>
<p><strong> Collection of personal information by us </strong></p>
<p> The kinds of personal information we collect and store will depend on what products and services you request from us or we provide to you. However, it may include (amongst other things): </p>
<ul>
    <li> personal information you give us when you apply for membership of the Velocity Program. This information may include your name, mailing address, telephone numbers, e-mail address and date of birth ; </li>
    <li> information about transactions resulting in Points being earned or redeemed, and Rewards you receive; </li>
    <li> information about your Velocity Rewards Account, including the number of Points earned or redeemed; </li>
    <li> communications between you and us; and </li>
    <li> if you are applying for a position, we will collect information as outlined in the section below titled "Employment Applications". </li>
</ul>
<p> We may collect your personal information directly from you, or from third parties including our related entities, contractors, agents , Velocity Rewards Partners and other members of the Velocity Program. </p>
<p><strong> Collection of personal information from children </strong></p>
<p> Where we collect personal information from a child (someone who we know is under 18 years of age), depending on the type of information we collect and how we intend to use it, we may ask the child to provide us with their parent's contact details. We will then seek their parent's consent to store, use and disclose the child's information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we do not receive their parent's consent within a reasonable time, we will remove the child's personal information from our records. </p>
<p><strong> How your personal information is stored </strong></p>
<p> We take reasonable steps to preserve the security of cookie and personal information. If your browser is suitably configured, it will advise you whether the information you are sending us will be secure (encrypted) or not secure (unencrypted). If secure transmission is indicated, we currently use 128 bit SSL encryption. </p>
<p> We regularly review developments in security and encryption technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. Accordingly, although we strive to protect such information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps to preserve the security of the information in our own systems. </p>
