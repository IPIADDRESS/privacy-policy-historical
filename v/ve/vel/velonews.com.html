      <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p align="center"><b>COMPETITOR GROUP ONLINE PRIVACY AND COOKIE POLICY</b></p>
<p><b>Last Updated:</b>&nbsp; March 30, 2017</p>
<p>We understand privacy online is important to users of our website, any other domain registered to the Competitor Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Competitor Group” or “we”), and our mobile apps and social networking pages/profiles/feeds that post or display a link to this privacy policy (collectively, our “Sites”).</p>
<p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) governs our privacy practices with respect to how we collect, use, and disclose consumer personal information gathered from our Sites including, but not limited to, competitor.com, velonews.com, triathlete.com, womensrunning.com and the websites for Competitor Group events (e.g., Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series, and Carlsbad 5000). A list of subsidiaries and affiliated companies of the Competitor Group is available <a href="http://www.competitorgroup.com/">here</a>. For purposes of Directive 95/946 EC (“The EU Directive”), Competitor Group Inc. will be the “data controller” of the information we collect through the Sites, unless a different Competitor Group affiliate or subsidiary is identified as the operator of a particular Site, in which case that separately-identified affiliate or subsidiary will be the data controller. This Policy does not apply to raceit.com or any other websites, applications or services that do not display or link to this Policy or that display or link to a different privacy policy. By using the Sites or otherwise consenting to the data processing terms identified herein, you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p><b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Information Collected by Us</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Information You Provide.</b>&nbsp; We collect information about you and the computers or devices you use in various ways when you use our Sites. We collect personal information you provide to us. For instance, if you register for a Competitor Group event, we will collect your username, password, name, email address, phone number, birth date, gender, emergency contact information, and other information you provide during registration. We also collect your credit card number, billing address, and other payment information if you purchase products or services on our Sites. If you enter into a promotion, contest or sweepstakes (“Sweepstakes”) sponsored by Competitor Group, we will collect information you provide for such Sweepstakes. We also collect information you provide us in newsletter sign-ups, feedback forms, emails, and surveys, including your email address. We may also obtain information from other sources (e.g., from our Registration Partners, Marketing Partners, and Sweepstakes Partners) or from you offline (e.g., at events) and combine that information with information we collect on our Sites.</p>
<p><b>(b)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Information Automatically Collected.</b>&nbsp; When you visit our Sites, some information is automatically collected and logged including, for example, your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, device IDs, operating system, access times, browser type and language, domain name, and the website you visited before you visited our Sites. We also collect information about your usage and activity on our Sites as described below:</p>
<p><b>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Cookies</b>.&nbsp; We and our service providers may automatically collect information using “cookies”. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website. Among other things, we and our service providers use cookies to store visitors’ preferences, record session information, such as what items users add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit and what advertisements they click or view, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our Sites, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our Sites, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and customize content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. Please also see section 1b(ii), 1b(iii), 1c and 2(a) below which describes the cookies that are served by third parties on our Sites. We may also use cookies to target advertising to our users’ interests, both on our Sites and on other, unaffiliated websites, based on information including, but not limited to browsing behavior, demographic characteristics, location and personal preferences. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Sites. For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer and how to manage and delete them, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a> and review Section 7.b below.</p>

<p><b>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Web Beacons.&nbsp; </b>We and our service providers may collect information using Web beacons (aka clear gifs). Web beacons are tiny transparent graphic images embedded in our Sites and in our emails that may be used in combination with cookies to record, measure and understand user behavior. We and our service providers use Web beacons to count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, tailor content and advertising to user interests, and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. To learn more about Web beacons, including how to manage their use in combination with cookies, click <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/web-beacons/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Google Analytics</b>.&nbsp; We use Google Analytics to help us analyze how users use the Sites. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Sites, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics places a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies" target="_blank">here</a> and you can avoid the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
<p><b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Social Networks.</b>&nbsp; If you log in to one of the Sites with your login credentials from a social networking site (“SNS”), such as Facebook or Google+, we may receive personal and anonymous information about you from the SNS. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Sites, and we may use it as described in this Policy. We are not responsible for any errors in the information your SNS provides to us. We may provide information about you to your SNS in accordance with your request (e.g., if you want to post something from our Sites to your Facebook wall), for your SNS’s own use, which will be subject to the SNS’s privacy policy. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for any SNS’s use of information we provide to it or for any SNS’s compliance with its own privacy policy.</p>
<div id="third-parties">
<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Third Parties</b><br>
<b>Third Party Advertisements and Interest Based Advertising.</b><br>
<b>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b> We may use ad exchanges, ad networks, audience segment providers and other third parties to serve ads and help us deliver ads on the Sites (“Advertising Partners”). These Advertising Partners make certain information available to us and they also automatically collect information about our users’ interactions with our Sites and other sites and mobile applications not affiliated with us. The information they collect and information they may provide to us includes: unique IDs associated with Cookies; Internet Protocol address and geographic locations derived from IP addresses; device information including unique device IDs, HTTP headers or other internet transfer protocol signals; browser or device type and version; operating system type and version; information about the presence or use of “apps” on mobile devices, a user’s preferred language; information about a user’s browsing activities and interactions with our Sites and other sites, including advertisements clicked, websites, apps and content areas visited, and the date and time of these activities. The information provided may also include offline information that is de-identified (so that it isn’t associated with a particular person), including demographic information such as a user’s gender, age, zip code, income range and interests. Advertisers on the Sites may collect similar information. Our Advertising Partners and advertisers collect this information using their own cookies, Web beacons, JavaScript and other technologies.<p></p>
<p><b>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b> Subject to applicable law, the information provided and collected by our Advertising Partners is used to create Profiles and Interest Segments that in turn are used to enhance your online experience by delivering marketing campaigns that make the content and ads you see on our Sites, other sites and mobile applications more relevant to you. A “Profile” is a set of attributes about a specific user or device (e.g., a woman, aged 25-34, who lives in Chicago and is interested in travel, shoes and professional football). An “Interest Segment” is a group of Profiles that share a common behavior or preference, like travel. Advertising Partners, and advertisers on our Sites that collect similar information, may deliver these targeted marketing campaigns on our Sites and on websites or mobile applications that are unrelated to us. Similarly, Advertising Partners may develop Profiles in connection with multiple devices (such as desktops, smartphones and tablets), browsers and/or mobile applications that you use, and link those Profiles and corresponding interest data using cross-device and cross-app technology. This technology is designed to enable Advertising Partners to connect a user’s Profile and Interest Segments across different devices, browsers and applications that he or she uses to access digital content. For example, a user’s interests determined while viewing a website on a desktop browser might lead to the user seeing a relevant ad while viewing a different website on the user’s smartphone.

<p><b>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Registration Partners.&nbsp; </b> We may provide your personal information to third-party event registration services that manage registration in Competitor Group events (“Registration Partners”) or authorize them to collect your personal information directly.  We currently engage our affiliated company, Raceit.com, to manage registration for most of our events but we also use unaffiliated Registration Partners for certain events, including events in China, Mexico, Portugal and Spain.   This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the information collection, sharing or security practices of any Registration Partners, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of our Registration Partners to learn about their privacy practices.  Registration Partners may share your information with us in accordance with their respective privacy policies and we may share your information with them as described below.

<p><b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Notice To California Residents</b> – Your California Privacy Rights (As Provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83).</p>
<p>California Users: Your California Privacy Rights. California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing.  We have such a policy in place.  California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing PrivacyPolicy@competitorgroup.com.  Please note that we are required to respond to one request per California customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>
