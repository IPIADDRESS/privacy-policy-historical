                              <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>In order to determine a user's ability to receive HTML e-mail in addition to whether or not an e-mail has been opened, Vegas.com
                                 may include a "web beacon" in the HTML e-mail messages it sends. A web beacon is activated when an HTML e-mail is opened via
                                 a request for the image on Vegas.com's servers. This capability helps Vegas.com send e-mails in a format users can read and
                                 enables Vegas.com to track the aggregate number of e-mails opened. The web beacon does not collect any personally identifiable
                                 information. Users that do not want to receive e-mail messages with web beacons can choose to receive their e-mails in text
                                 (non-HTML) format. Vegas.com may also use the web beacon capability to track when a URL has been clicked inside of an e-mail
                                 message sent by Vegas.com. Vegas.com uses this functionality to track which links are clicked and in what quantity, as well
                                 as the aggregate number of links clicked. This click tracking functionality does not collect personally identifiable information.

                              <p><strong>Tracking Pixels</strong><br>As a means of measuring the efficacy of the online advertising and marketing campaigns that VEGAS.com employs, we may also
                                 allow third-party advertising companies to use a single-pixel image file on our site to collect information about your visit.
                                 This information is anonymous in nature. It only identifies actions being performed on our website. It does not tie actions
                                 back to any individual user of our website. No personally identifiable information is collected during this process.

                              <p>Certain VEGAS.com marketing and confirmation e-mails may also contain a single-pixel image file to detect when and whether
                                 you've opened the e-mail. VEGAS.com may also track clicks from e-mail communications using an internal or third-party tracking
                                 system. This information is gathered in aggregate and is not used to identify individual movements within our e-mails or through
