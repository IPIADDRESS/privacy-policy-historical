voluntarily provided to us by our customers and is used by us for the purpose
of fulfilling requests, inquiries or travel service orders. <b>VEGAS.com does

</p></li><li> <b>Aggregate user and tracking information:</b> This information
gives us insights on how our customers and site visitors use our site and our
other products. This data is anonymous in nature and does not contain any
personally identifiable information. We use this information to ensure that

</p></li></ul>

<b><u>Information we collect about you</u></b><p>

<p>VEGAS.com only requires personally identifiable information from
you when it's needed to complete your purchase, fulfill your order or request,
or when you voluntarily decide to register as a member independent of a
transaction. </p><p>

</p><p><b><u>Other information VEGAS.com collects</u></b></p><p>

</p><p>When you visit the VEGAS.com website, we automatically collect
some information about your visit using cookies, log analysis software and
other aggregate tracking technologies.  </p><p>

</p><p><b>Cookies</b></p><p>

</p><p>Cookies
are files that contain small amounts of data. If your browser is configured to
accept these files, they are stored on your computer's hard drive. VEGAS.com
uses these data files when you visit our site to anonymous identify you. By
using cookies, VEGAS.com is able to:</p><p>

</p><ul>
<li> Completely support and enhance your visit to our site. 

</li><li> Allow you to access your account information without
requiring you to answer your sign-in question multiple times during the same
visit to our site. 

</li><li> Ensure that you won't see the same advertisements too
often. 

</li><li> Better measure how many users view and navigate our site.  

</li><li> Better measure how effective our online marketing
campaigns are performing. 

</li></ul>

<p>If
you wish, you may set your browser to refuse cookies. However, by refusing to
accept a cookie, you will not be able to access some pages or purchase certain
travel services on VEGAS.com. Since many websites use some form of cookie
technology, setting your browser to refuse cookies may restrict your access to
certain information or product offerings on those websites. Some VEGAS.com
cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive unless and until you manually
delete the file. VEGAS.com cookie files do not contain personally identifiable
information or track an individual users' movement through our site.</p><p>

</p><p>A
VEGAS.com third-party advertiser cookie file may also be placed on your hard
drive during your visit to our website. The purpose of these types of cookies
is to collect aggregate statistics about your visit to our website. These
cookies do not contain personally identifiable information or track an
individual users' movement through our site.</p><p>

</p><p><b>Tracking
pixels</b></p><p>

</p><p>As
a means of measuring the efficacy of the online advertising and marketing
campaigns that VEGAS.com employs, we may also allow third-party advertising
companies to use a single-pixel image file on our site to collect information
about your visit. This information is anonymous in nature. It only identifies
actions being performed on our website. It does not tie actions back to any
individual user of our website. No personally identifiable information is
collected during this process. </p><p>

Certain VEGAS.com marketing and confirmation e-mails may also
contain a single-pixel image file to detect when and whether you've
opened the e-mail. VEGAS.com may also track clicks from e-mail communications
using an internal or third-party tracking system. This information is gathered
in aggregate and is not used to identify individual movements within our
e-mails or through our website. </p><p>

These tracking mechanisms are used to ensure that the VEGAS.com
website and e-mails continue to provide relevant content that is interesting and
useful to our customers.</p><p>

</p><p><b>Log file analysis</b></p><p>

sources. Examples include updated address, travel itinerary or e-mail address
information from such sources as travel service providers, co-branded
businesses, business partners or other third parties; or credit history
information from credit bureaus.</p><p>

</p><p>This
information can help us accurately fulfill orders or deliver purchase
confirmation messages. Credit history information can also help us detect and
work to prevent fraudulent activity on our website or through our call
center.  </p><p>

</p><p>We
also receive aggregate information such as page views, search terms and
click-through information from sources, such as companies we advertise

is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
