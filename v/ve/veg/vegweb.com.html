<a name="info"><b>Information collected and how it is used</b></a><br>
Veggies Unite! will use reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure or use of your personal information.
We will not sell, share, or rent your information in any way different from what 
is disclosed in this statement. Veggies Unite! collects information 
from you at several different points on our website. This information is used 
to enhance your experience on Veggies Unite! and as described below.  


</p><p align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
<b>We collect information in the following areas:</b>
<p>
<a name="reg"><b>I.  Membership</b></a>

<br>
Veggies Unite! does not collect your personal identifiable information unless you 
provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means we don't require you to 
sign up as a member or provide personally identifiable information to us in order to view our site. However, you 
must become a member if you wish to use certain features on our site. 
</p><p>
In order to sign up for the following features you must first complete an 
online membership form. 

</p><ul>
<li>Recipe, Article, and Book Comments</li>
<li>Discussion Boards</li>
<li>Grocery List and Meal Planner</li>
<li>Contests and Promotions</li>
<li>Membership Bios</li>
</ul>


During membership registration you are required to give contact information 
(such as your name and email address). This information is used to provide 
the services that you have requested, or to contact you about the service 
on our site for which you have expressed interest. We may contact you from 
time to time with news. <p>


	      <a name="security"><b>Security &amp; Safety</b></a><br>
	      
To take the worry out of using your credit card to pay the voluntary
membership dues, we use PayPal and Amazon.com Honor System.  They have
Secure Server Technology (SSL), which encrypts your credit card
information so that it cannot be read as it travels over the
Internet. Which means - the characters are scrambled, making it
impossible for another party to intercept your personal information.
	      </p><p>

You can verify that the encryption is working by locating the lock
icon at the bottom of the web page. While on a secure page, the lock
icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked,
or open, as when you are just 'surfing.'
	      </p><p>

	      <b>Contests and Promotions</b><br>
	      You must be a member in order to enter contests and promotions on 
	      Veggies Unite!. Participation in these events is completely voluntary and 
	      we do not require you to disclose this information. Information requested 
	      may include contact information (such as your name and shipping address) and 
	      demographic information. Your contact information will be used to notify you 
	      if you've won and to award prizes. 
	      </p><p>

<a name="recipesub"><b>II.  Recipe Submission</b></a><br>
Your personally identifying information may be used for editorial purposes 
(such as attributing your submitted recipe to you). We may also use this 
information to contact you should we have any complications with your 
recipe. 
</p><p>

<a name="erecipes"><b>III.  E-Recipes ("E-mail this recipe to a friend" link)</b></a><br>

When you elect to use our referral service for emailing a recipe to a
friend, we ask you for your friend's name and email address and your
name and email addres. We will automatically send your friend the
recipe and a link back to Veggies Unite!. We do not store you or your
friend's contact information.
</p><p>

	      
<a name="newsletter"><b>IV. Veggies Unite! Newsletter and Weekly Recipe List</b></a><br>

We use the services provided by www.yourmailinglistprovider.com to
maintain our mailing lists and to send out messages to our mailing
lists. When you subscribe to one of our newsletters, it is through
them. They may ask for contact information such as your name and email
address.  They guarantee that email addresses that are collected via
their website are not sold or passed to third parties.
</p><p>
When you sign up for one of our mailing lists hosted by
YourMailinglistProvider, a welcome page located on their server is
shown.  They generate revenues with the banner displayed on this page.</p><p>


<a name="cookies"><b>V.  Cookies</b></a>
<br>

Like most web sites, we use "cookie" technology on our web site.  We
may place a "cookie" in the browser file of your computer, however the
"cookie" contains only your membership username and encrypted
password.  The "cookie" does not extract any information off your
computer. We use the "cookie" to allow you access to use the features
on our site which require membership.</p><p>

If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site.  The 
only drawback to this is that you will be limited from accessing 
the features of our site which require membership.</p><p>

Some of our business partners also use cookies on our site.  See <a href="/misc/privacy.shtml#third">Third Party Advertising</a></p><p>

<a name="log"><b>VI. Log Files and IP addresses</b></a><br>

Each time a Veggies Unite! page is requested from your browser, we
log your computer's IP address into our log files. Your computer has
been pre-assigned a 12-digit number. This number is the IP address. We
use your IP address to analyze trends, administer the site, track your
movements on the site, and gather broad demographic information for
aggregate use. When you use the Discussion Boards, we encrypt your IP
address and include it in your post.  This is to help prevent spam.
Occasionally, we may have to include your unencrypted IP address in
your post.</p><p>

</p><p align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>

<a name="surveys"><b>VII. Polls and Surveys</b></a><br>		  

From time to time our site requests information from you via polls and
surveys.  This information will be used for purposes of monitoring or
improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Polls and surveys
may also be used to determine how you and other users of Veggies
Unite! feel about various issues. Participation is completely at your
discretion.<p>

</p><p align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>

<a name="third"><b>Third Party Advertising</b></a><br>

We use Linkshare and other third-party advertising companies to serve
ads and to provide broad demographic information for better
advertisement targeting.  Privacy issues surrounding Linkshare's use
of certain non-personally identifiable user information by its
technology are discussed in Linkshare's privacy policy, and are the
sole responsibility of Linkshare. That policy can be viewed on
Linkshare's <a href="http://www.linkshare.com/privacy.html">Privacy
Policy page</a>.

		  <p></p><p align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>


		  <a name="other"><b>Other Sites</b></a>
		  
		  <br>
  From time to time we may have links to other websites from our site.  
  We do not control, and therefore cannot be responsible for, the collection, 
  use or disclosure of your information by any such third party site.  Please 
  carefully review the privacy policy of any third party site that you go to 
  from our site.

  <p></p><p align="right"><a href="/misc/privacy.shtml#top">TOP</a></p>

  <a name="personal"><b>Correction/updating Personal Information:</b></a><br>
  At any time, you can update your information by sending an email 
  request to us at: 
  <a href="mailto:veggie@vegweb.com">veggie@vegweb.com</a>.
  <p>
  In addition, you may notify us if you wish to cease the use of any of your 
  information by sending an email request to the same address and we will use 
  reasonable efforts to comply with your request.
  </p><p align="right"><a href="/misc/privacy.shtml#top">TOP</a></p>

  <a name="changes"><b>Our policies may change.</b></a><br>

By using our web sites, you consent to the collection and use of your
information, as described above, by Veggies Unite!. If we make any

so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we

our privacy policy will extend to any and all information we may
