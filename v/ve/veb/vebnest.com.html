        <p><strong>Collection of personal information</strong><br>
          When you engage in 
          certain activities on this site, such as ordering products, downloading 
          software, or entering contests, VEBNEST may ask you to provide certain 
          information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is 
          completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to 
          engage in these activities, however, VEBNEST may ask that you provide us 
          personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address 
          (including zip code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, 
          telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal identifying information. 
          When ordering products or services on the site, you may be asked to provide a 
          credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we 
          ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do 
          not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will 
          not be able to engage in that activity.<br>
          In the process of administering our 
          site, we maintain and track usage through Web server logs. Web server logs 
          provide such information as what types of browsers are accessing our site, what 
          pages receive high traffic, and the times of day our servers experience 
          significant load. We use this information to improve the content and navigation 
          features of our site. It is not used to personally identify you.</p>
        <p><strong>How your personal information is used</strong><br>
          VEBNEST collects 
          your information in order to record and support your participation in the 
          activities you select. The information that you provide is also used as part of 
          our effort to keep you informed about special offers and other products and 
          services of VEBNEST and selected third parties.</p>
        <p><strong>How we share your personal information</strong><br>
          We will not sell, 
          rent or lease to others telephone numbers or e-mail addresses. We will share the 
          personal data you provide only with other VEBNEST entities and/or business 
          partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above, except as 
          provided below (see Consent).</p>
        <p><strong>Consent</strong><br>
          VEBNEST will use and share the personally 
          identifiable information you provided to us in ways related to those described 
          above. We reserve the right to disclose any and all pertinent customer 
          information to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole 
          discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Reprinting personal information</strong><br>
          Please note that any 
          information you post to a public bulletin board or chat room, is available to 
          all persons accessing that site.</p>
        <p><strong>Abuse Reports</strong><br>
          We know for having lots of scam and 
          fraudulant activities, most of the hosted customers face several unconscious 
          abuse report(s). We therefore, tried to create a powerful abuse team to verify 
          the abuse reports (Copyright, Email Spam, Unauthorised Activities) sent to us. 
          We first verify the reporters identity and then verify the existence of 
          copyrighted material according to our company law. A reporter has to send a 
          paper with the compnay header signed by him/her/company’s MD to prove the 
          copyright authorisation. According to MLA, only Abuse Department (Or Piracy 
          Department) of the related company/personal is only allowed to send an abuse 
          request to our Department for verification. If its a personal copyright, then a 
          Passport identity including his/her copyright over the material has to be proven 
          to our abuse department. All the documents are verified according to our law and 
          MLA. If Abuse passes the request to Support, then support department asks the 
          owner to take proper action against the complaint. If support doesn’t receive 
          proper information(s) from client then a suspention is issued after 15 days of 
          escalation. This steps are only taken to prevent fradulant scam reports and 
          reduce the activities of support to verify the abuse report. For Email spamming 
          a proper header is required so that its possible to do a network scan and find 
          out the verification of the email sender. For any Abuse report please contact 
          our Abuse department using the contact provided here: 
          http://www.vebnest.com/contact.php</p>

          concerns relating to this Privacy Statement or compliance with it, please send
