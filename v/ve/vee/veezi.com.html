<h3 align="left">Legal basis for using your personal information</h3>
<p align="left">We will only collect, use and share your personal information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do this (namely, that the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests and/or for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject). This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>we need to use your personal information to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you;&nbsp;</li>
<li>we need to use your personal information for our legitimate interest as a commercial organisation. For example, we may use your email address to send you invites or inform you of events that we host globally for example our biennial customer conference or trade show meetings.&nbsp; In all such cases, we will look after your information always in a way that is proportionate and respects your privacy rights and you have a right to object to processing as explained in the <a href="#legalrights">Legal Rights section</a> below;</li>
<li>we need to use your personal information to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we have; or</li>
<li>we have your consent to using your personal information for a particular activity.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">If you would like to find out more about the legal basis for which we process personal information, please <a href="#contact">contact us</a>.</p>
<h3 align="left">How we protect and store your information</h3>
<p align="left">We implement and maintain a variety of appropriate technical and organizational security measures, policies and procedures &nbsp;to maintain the safety of your personal information when you subscribe or enter, submit, or access your personal or business information.<br> <br> <strong>Your Data is sent securely across the internet</strong><br> Veezi's servers have SSL Certificates issued by a leading certificate authority Digicert, so all Data transferred between users and the Service is encrypted. However, the internet is not in itself a secure environment. Users should only enter, or instruct the importation of, Data to the database within a secure environment. This means that your browser must support the encryption security used in connection with the Service.</p>
<p align="left">Veezi stores your data for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, in the location Veezi considers will give you the most efficient access from wherever in the world you may be. Access and storage controls via the service are however administered by Veezi in New Zealand (a white listed country for GDPR purposes) as the custodian of that data. Where you access or input data from somewhere other than the country where the data is stored or to be stored, you consent to that data being transferred from one country to the other (including via any intermediate country) as a function of transmission across the internet.</p>
<p align="left">Where your information is no longer needed, we will ensure that it is disposed of in a secure manner within 20 business days. In some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance: where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements; so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges; or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Veezi does not store your credit card details</strong><br> When you choose to pay for the Service by credit card, your credit card details are not stored by the service and cannot be accessed by Veezi staff. Your credit card details are encrypted and securely stored by Payment Express to enable Veezi to automatically bill your credit card on a recurring basis.</p>

<p>You can exercise your rights by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@vista.co">privacy@vista.co</a>.&nbsp;Subject to legal and other permissible considerations, we will make every reasonable effort to honour your request promptly or inform you if we require further information in order to fulfil your request.&nbsp;</p>
