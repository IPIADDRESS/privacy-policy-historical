<h1>Veetle Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Veetle provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of <a href="http://www.veetle.com">www.veetle.com</a>, <a href="http://www.veetle.org">www.veetle.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.veetle.info">www.veetle.info</a>  (collectively and individually, the "Sites").  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Sites.  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Sites.  You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.</p>
<p>As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating,  modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>
<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Sites, services, features and content, to administer registration and correspondence through the Sites (together, the "Service") and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Sites. </p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>When and after you register with us through the Sites or when you choose to create your own profile webpage, we will ask you for personally identifiable information.  This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information").  Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name and e-mail.  We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.</li>
    <li>We may also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own), gender (on its own), and individual preferences) ("Non-Identifying Information").</li>
    <li>We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.  </li>
    <li>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Veetle newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "user preferences" information. (See "Changing or Deleting Information," below</li>
</ol>
<h3>Log Data</h3>
<p>When you visit the Sites, whether as a registered or non-registered user, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data").  This Log Data may include but is not limited to information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Sites, pages of our Sites that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Sites, access times and dates, and other statistics.  We use the Google Analytics service to collect, monitor and analyze the Log Data in order to increase the Sites' and Service's functionality and user-friendliness, to better tailor it to our visitors' needs, and to understand and analyze how you are using the Sites or Service.  We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information. </p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Sites and to identify you when you are actively using the Sites.  Session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Sites and Service and then close your browser.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Sites or all functionality of the Service. </p>
<h2>Phishing</h2>
<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Veetle.  Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request information from you in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.  For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.</p>
<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<h3>Your Profile</h3>
<p>When you submit your Personal Information to create a profile webpage, Veetle users will see your screen Name. Providing profile information beyond your screen name is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with Veetle users.   We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen name.</p>
<h3>Service Providers</h3>
<p>We may employ or use third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Sites-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Sites' features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Sites and Service are used.  These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
<h3>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>Veetle cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Veetle or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. </p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>Veetle may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.  </p>
<h2>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>
<p>All registered users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us.  If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated.

<h2>Security </h2>

<h2>International Transfer</h2>

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<p>Our Site contains links to other websites.  If you choose to visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website.  The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.  We do not exercise control over third party websites.  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.  </p>
