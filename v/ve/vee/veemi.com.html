	<h2><font size="2">Privacy Policy</font></h2>
<p><font size="2">Veemi Media Portal ("Veemi.com," "we" or "us") provides this Privacy Policy  to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and  disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.Veemi.com (this  "Site") and our media player which enables users to stream and broadcast content  (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy applies only to information  that you provide to us through the Services. This Privacy Policy may be updated  from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new  Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for  any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this  Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Veemi.com Terms of Service.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information  include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical  or other analysis and using or touching information in any way, including, but  not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using,  combining, disclosing and transferring information within the United States or  internationally.</font></p>
<h3><font size="2">Information Collection and Use</font></h3>
<p><font size="2">Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our  Services, features and content, to administer your membership and to enable  users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. We also may also use your  information in order to better understand how our Services are used.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><u>Personally Identifiable Information.</u></font></p>
<ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><font size="2">In the course of using the Services, we ask  	you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can  	be used to contact or identify you and administer your account ("Personal  	Information"). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your  	name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address  	and home and business postal addresses. We use your Personal Information  	mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries.</font></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><font size="2">Please be aware that when you register to  	become a Veemi.com Member, other users of the Services may be able to see  	your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that  	you post to the Site or submit via the Services. We recommend that you guard  	your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name  	as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify  	you.</font></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><font size="2">We also collect the other information that  	you provide as part of your use of the Services, including via your  	registration and the administration and personalization of your profile  	webpage (e.g., without limitation zip code and individual preferences)  	("Non-Identifying Information"). Certain Non-Identifying Information would  	be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with  	other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street  	address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of  	information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken  	alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example,  	your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with  	Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from  	other Veemi.com Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to  	improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand  	how our Services are used.</font></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><font size="2">We also use your Personal Information to  	contact you with Veemi.com newsletters, marketing or promotional materials  	and other information that may be of interest to you. Veemi.com Members who  	agree to the terms and conditions of the Veemi.com Terms of Service  	Agreement are given the opportunity to opt into receiving such  	communications from us in the future. If you decide at any time that you no  	longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the  	unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update  	your "user preferences" information. (See "Changing or Deleting  	Information," below.)</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="2"><u>Log Data.</u> As you use the Services, whether as a Veemi.com Member or a  non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a "Veemi.com User"), our  servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you  visit a website ("Log Data"). This log data may include information such as your  computer's IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting.  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the  Site's technical administration. We do not treat Log Data as Personal  Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we  may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as  stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</font>
<h3><font size="2">Cookies</font></h3>
<p><font size="2">Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a  small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping  purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies  to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the  Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor  aggregate usage by Veemi.com Users and web traffic routing on the Services.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when  you close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place  or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by editing its  options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie  from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not  be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.</font></p>
<h4><font size="2">Information Sharing and Disclosure</font></h4>
<p><font size="2"><u>Veemi.com Members.</u> When you register through the Site and submit your  Personal Information to create a profile webpage, Veemi.com Users will see your  "Screen Name" and the month and year you first registered with Veemi.com  ("Required Member Identifiers"). You can choose what other Personal Information  you provide as part of your profile ("Other Member Information") and in some  cases you can choose whether to share that information publicly on the Site by  making selections via the "user preferences" section of your profile webpage.  Providing Other Member Information is voluntary and should correlate with the  degree of interaction you want to have with Veemi.com Users. We recommend that  you guard your anonymity and sensitive information.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><u>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</u> We may share  aggregated information which does not include Personal Information and we may  otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties  for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any such  aggregated information will not contain your Personal Information.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><u>Service Providers.</u> We may employ third party companies and individuals  to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform  Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database  management, web analytics and improvement of the Site's features), or to assist  us in analyzing how our Services are used. These third parties have access to  your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are  obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</u> Veemi.com cooperates with  government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and  comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or  law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion,  believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process  (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of  Veemi.com or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person,  or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><u>Business Transfers.</u> Veemi.com may sell, transfer or otherwise share  some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection  with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of  bankruptcy. If Veemi.com becomes involved in a merger, acquisition,  reorganization or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide  notice to you before your Personal Information is transferred and becomes  subject to a different privacy policy.</font></p>
<h3><font size="2">Changing or Deleting Your Information</font></h3>
<p><font size="2">All Veemi.com Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal  Information in their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely  delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you  would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will  attempt to accommodate your request. See below for privacy contact information.</font></p>
<h3><font size="2">Security</font></h3>
<p><font size="2">Veemi.com is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ  administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your  information from unauthorized access. We will make any legally required  disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality or integrity of your  unencrypted electronically stored Personal Data (as defined in applicable state  statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous  posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without  unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law  enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach  and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</font></p>
<h3><font size="2">International Transfer</font></h3>
<p><font size="2">Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers  located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental  jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your  jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide  information to us, Veemi.com transfers Personal Information to the United States  and processes it there. Your submission of such information represents your  agreement to that transfer.</font></p>
<h3><font size="2">Links to Other Sites</font></h3>
<p><font size="2">The Services contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an  advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click  on another third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's website.  The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of  advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our  affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or  information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over  third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other  files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we  collect from you through our Services. Other sites follow different rules  regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other  websites you visit.</font></p>
<h4><font size="2">Our Policy Toward Children</font></h4>
<p><font size="2">Veemi.com does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from  children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child  has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she  should contact us at support@veemi.com. If we become aware that a child under 13  has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from  our files.</font></p>
