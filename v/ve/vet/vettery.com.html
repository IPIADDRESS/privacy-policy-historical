By using the Service, you consent to the monitoring, recording, storage and disclosure of such communications you send or receive for these purposes. All Content and Information that you decide to make publicly available will be visible to other users of the Service.</li>
            <li><b>Information we receive from third party sites you connect to our Service</b>.  We may also receive Personal Information about you from third parties and combine that with information we collect through our Service. For example, we may obtain information when you login or register with us through a third party social network or authentication service, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub or Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us, which could include your name, email address, address book and contacts, or other information. Similarly, when you interact with us through a social media site or third party service, such as when you like, follow or share Vettery content on any third party social network, we may receive certain Information from the social network including your profile information, picture, user ID associated with your social media account, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive from these third party sites is dependent upon that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third party site.

We maintain location information only so long as you maintain an account with us and then delete location data tied to your personal information. We may maintain de-identified location data for a longer period of time in order to analyze aggregate trends and metrics.</li>
            <li><b>Information we receive from third parties.</b>  From time to time, we may receive Information about you from third parties and other users.
