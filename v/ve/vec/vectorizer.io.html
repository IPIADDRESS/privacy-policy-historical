We naturally observe the provisions of the Federal Data Protection Act (German "BDSG") and the Telemedia Act (German "TMG"), the General Data Protection Regulation (Europe "GDPR", German "DS-GVO") 2016/679 and will only collect and process personal user data to the extent described in this data protection declaration.

</blockquote>


<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<blockquote>
	
	According to the DS-DGVO, personal information is information that can be used to determine your identity. This includes information such as your real name, address, postal address, telephone number and email address. Information that is not directly associated with your real identity (such as favorite websites or the number of users of a site) is not included.
	The IP address can also be a personal date. An IP address is assigned to each device connected to the Internet by the Internet provider so that it can send and receive data. 
	
	<br>
	<br>
		<strong>You can use our online offer without disclosing your identity. </strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	
Some functions of this website require the collection and processing of the following personal information:

<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Social Media Account</strong>
    <br>
    
    You can sign in with your social media account. The sign in process is executed by your social media provider and if successful, we receive an OAuth data set for your account. From this data set we store and process the following personal information:
    <ul>
        <li>Unique Account Identifier</li>
        <li>E-Mail Address</li>
        <li>Social Media Username</li>
    </ul>
    Your personal information will not be used for marketing purposes, will not be shown to other website users and will not be passed on to third parties.
	<br>
	
	
 </li>
</ul>
<br>
	The legal basis for such processing is Article 6 Abs. 1 lit. b) DS-GVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the aforementioned purpose. 
	<br>
	Storage period: We store personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes listed above. Art. 5 para. 1 lit. e) DS-GVO.

</blockquote>

 
<h2>Non-personal Information</h2>


<blockquote>	
	
	
	You have to choose the following entries on this website in such a way that it is not possible to draw conclusions about your identity.

		<li>
			<strong>Uploaded Images</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Select a picture here that does not allow any conclusion on your identity. Never use a personal photo here!
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		 
	</ul>
	

</blockquote>



<h2>Contact by E-mail</h2>
<blockquote>

If you contact us by e-mail, we will at least process your e-mail address and any other personal information contained in the e-mail. This happens exclusively to answer your inquiry.
<br>
<br>
The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b) DS-GVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the aforementioned purpose.

<h2>Order Data Processing</h2>
<blockquote>
Should data be passed on to service providers within the scope of order data processing, they are bound to the BDSG, other legal regulations and contractually to this Privacy Policy.

<h2>Approval-free first party cookies on this website</h2>
<blockquote>
Absolutely necessary cookies, also called "strictly necessary", guarantee functions without which you could not use this website as intended. These cookies are used exclusively by this website and are therefore so-called first party cookies. They are only saved on your computer during the current browser session. Absolutely necessary cookies ensure, for example, that their bandwidth-related data volume corresponds to that of the Internet connection you are using. Furthermore, such cookies ensure the functionality of switching from http to https and thus the compliance with increased security requirements for data transfer, for example when changing pages. Last but not least, such a cookie also saves your decision regarding the use of cookies on our website. Your consent is not required for the use of absolutely necessary cookies.

<h2>First party cookies on this web site requiring consent</h2>
<blockquote>

Cookies, which according to purely legal definition are not absolutely necessary in order to be able to use the website, fulfil important tasks. Without these cookies, functions that enable comfortable surfing on our website, such as pre-filled forms, are no longer available. 
Settings you have made, such as a sort order of questions in the forum, cannot be saved and must therefore be queried again on each page.

<blockquote>
This website also integrates third party content into this website. These third parties may set cookies when you visit the website. 
If you have decided not to grant or revoke your consent to the use of cookies that require your consent, only those functionalities of our website will be made available to you whose use we can guarantee without these cookies. 
Areas of our website that potentially offer the technical possibility of integrating third-party content and thus setting third party cookies are not available to you in this case.
