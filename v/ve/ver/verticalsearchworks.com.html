       Privacy Policy     </h1> <h1 style="text-align: left;">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting the VerticalSearchWorks Web site  (the “VSW Web site”). The protection of privacy is important to VSW  Corporation, its affiliates and subsidiaries (“VSW”). To better protect  privacy, VSW provides this notice explaining VSW’s online information  practices and the choices a User can make about the way information is  collected and used at this site.</p>
<h3>What information does the VSW Web site collect?</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of the VSW Web site is to provide VSW’s  customers, prospective customers, partners, stockholders, the  investment community and the public (“Users”) information about VSW.  From time to time, VSW may invite Users to subscribe to an email  service, order products, enter contests, and vote in polls or otherwise  express an opinion, among other things. The types of personally  identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include:  name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card  information, and information about User interests in and use of various  products, programs, and services. The VSW Web site also may collect  certain non-personally identifiable information when Users visit many of  VSW’s Web site pages such as the type of browser a User is using (e.g.,  Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system a User is  using, (e.g., Windows ’95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of a User’s  Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>
<h3>How does the VSW Web site use the information?</h3>
<p>The VSW Web site may use the information the User  provides about a User to fulfill the User’s requests for VSW’s products,  programs, and services, to respond to the User’s inquiries about VSW’s  software products and services, and to offer the User other products,  programs or services that VSW believes may be of interest to the User.  VSW sometimes uses this information to communicate with the User, such  as to notify the User when the User has won one of VSW’s contests, to  fulfill a request by a User to receive information by email, or to  contact a User about VSW’s products and services. The VSW Web site  sometimes uses the non-personally identifiable information that the VSW  Web site collects to improve the design and content of VSW’s site and to  enable us to personalize a User’s Internet experience. The VSW Web site  also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage.  Under certain circumstances, VSW may disclose personally identifiable  information to third parties. VSW may disclose personally identifiable  information, for example, in response to legal process in response to a  court order or a subpoena. VSW also may disclose such information in  response to a law enforcement agency’s request. Agents and contractors  of VSW who have access to personally identifiable information are  required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with  this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any  purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for  VSW. Although VSW takes appropriate measures to safeguard against  unauthorized disclosures of information, the VSW Web site cannot assure  Users that personally identifiable information that the VSW Web site  collects will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with  this Privacy Policy. From time to time the VSW Web site may disclose  personally identifiable information to companies whose practices are not  covered by this privacy notice that want to market products or services  to a User. If the VSW Web site shares personally identifiable  information to such a third party, VSW will provide Users with an  opportunity to opt out or block such uses. The VSW Web site may on  occasion combine information the VSW Web site received online with  outside records to enhance VSW’s ability to market to Users those  products or services that may be of interest to Users. If Users prefer  to not receive marketing information from this site, please follow the  Opt-Out Procedures set forth below. Finally, VSW will not use or  transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways  unrelated to the ones described above without also providing Users with  an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.</p>
<h3>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</h3>
<p>The VSW Web site may contain links to other sites whose  information practices may be different than VSW’s. Visitors should  consult the other sites’ privacy policies because the VSW Web site has  no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these  third parties. The VSW Web site may sometimes offer content (e.g.,  contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded  with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the  third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that  visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. VSW has  no control over these third parties’ use of this information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>To enhance User experience with VSW’s sites, the VSW Web  site may employ “cookies.” Cookies are text files the VSW Web site  places in its User computer’s browser to store User preferences.  Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us the User e-mail address or other  personally identifiable information unless the User chooses to provide  this information to us by, for example, registering for a VSW Web site  promotion. Once a User chooses to furnish the site with personally  identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data  stored in the cookie. VSW primarily uses cookies to understand site  usage and to improve the content of the VSW Web site. For example, VSW  may use cookies to personalize a User’s experience at the VSW Web site  or save a User password in password-protected areas. The VSW Web site  also may use cookies to offer the User VSW products, promotions, or  services.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The VSW Web site has security measures in place to help  protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under  VSW’s control. Any time the VSW Web site asks for a credit card number,  the VSW Web site transmits that credit card number in an encrypted  format. The VSW Web site uses industry-standard, SSL (secure socket  layer) encryption. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet  can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while the VSW Web site  strives to protect User personal information, VSW cannot ensure or  warrant the security of any information Users transmit to or from VSW’s  online products or services, and Users do so at their own risk. Once the  VSW Web site receives a User transmission, VSW will make reasonable  efforts to ensure its security on VSW’s systems.</p>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>The VerticalSearchWorks Web site is a general audience  site. It is not intended for, nor does VSW direct any of its content to,  children under thirteen (13) years of age.</p>
<h3>Opt-Out Procedures</h3>
<p>VSW gives a User the following options for removing User  information from VSW’s database in order to stop receiving future  communications from VSW. (Please note: VSW is not responsible for  removing information from third-party lists or entities with which a  User has previously authorized us to share its User information.)</p>
