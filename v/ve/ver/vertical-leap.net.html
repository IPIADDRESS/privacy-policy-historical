<p><strong><a name="PRIV2">Privacy Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by Vertical Leap Ltd</a></strong></p>
<p class="newstext"><strong>Privacy Principles</strong><br>
Because your trust and confidence is important to us, Vertical Leap conducts its business under the following privacy principles:</p>
<p class="newstext"><strong>Principle 1 – No Collection of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Vertical Leap Ltd does not collect any personal information such as names, ages, phone numbers, addresses or e-mail addresses from visitors to our customer’s web sites.</p>
<p class="newstext"><strong>Principle 2 – No Combination of Browsing and Web Traffic Information with Personal Information</strong><br>
Since Vertical Leap Ltd does not collect any personal information from website visitors, we do not combine traffic analysis information with personal information such as name, age, phone number or postal address.</p>
<p class="newstext"><strong>Principle 3 – No Aggregation of Individual Visitor Traffic Patterns across Multiple Sites</strong><br>
Vertical Leap Ltd does not collect individual profile information for visitors across multiple sites and does not aggregate information from any other sources about browsing patterns of individual visitors across multiple sites.</p>
<p class="newstext"><strong>Principle 4 – Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information </strong></p>
<p>Vertical Leap Ltd collects anonymous visitor information such as the search engine used to visit a client site, the search query used and pages visited. Vertical Leap Ltd collects this non-personally identifiable information for the following purposes: (1) to provide anonymous statistical analysis visits via organic search engines to our customers for their web sites; (2) to administer our web site and servers, (3) to allow for auditing of our services by third parties, and (4) to improve our services.</p>
<p class="newstext"><strong>Principle 5 – Anonymous Use of Cookies</strong><br>
It is Vertical Leap’s policy to use cookies only for more accurate anonymous traffic analysis such as tracking the search engine used, the search query and the pages visited on a client’s website. The cookie information does not include personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address. In addition, Vertical Leap does not link cookies to personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or postal address. As we do not build a database of individual visitors, the data that we do collect is never stored in any individual user profile; the data collected serves only to update aggregate counts allowing our customers to monitor traffic on their site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to reject cookies.</p>
<p class="newstext">Vertical Leap customers use customised JavaScript tracking code provided by Vertical Leap to track anonymous information about their web site visitors’ activity. This code contacts Vertical Leap’s servers, receives a response, and loads an image to the page. This 1×1 image is called a clear gif or web bug. This JavaScript tracking code does not collect personal information such as name, age, phone number, mailing address or credit card numbers from visitors to our customers’ web sites. Visitors may elect to opt out of receiving tracking cookies for all sites using Vertical Leap’s services. Please visit our opt-out page for more information.</p>
<p class="newstext"><strong>Principle 6 – No Individual Profiling</strong><br>
Vertical Leap Ltd does not create individual profiles of visitors. We do not have a database of individual profiles of each visitor. Vertical Leap collects data in aggregate form and data is not recorded or stored about individual visitors.</p>
<p class="newstext"><strong>Principle 7 – Third Party Access</strong><br>
Our customers control access to Vertical Leap Ltd’s analysis reports. Vertical Leap does not provide access to anyone other than the visitors identified by our customers.</p>
