            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

            <p>Protecting your private information is our priority.

            <p><br>Veracross complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Veracross has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

            <p><span class="c2">Collection of your Personal Information</span></p>

            <p>We may collect personally identifiable data, such as: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or other data required to enable us to provide services you may have requested or contracted us to provide, or on behalf of one of our Clients. We also may collect other identifying information from or about you in connection with your use of this website. For example, we may collect and store the content of, and data regarding, any correspondence you may have with us or our representatives, regardless of the subject matter or the mode of communication by which such correspondence is made. You may, however, visit our public website anonymously.</p>

            <p>As with many other websites, the Internet servers used to operate this website may collect certain information pertaining to you and the software, equipment and communications method that you use to access the Internet and this website. This information can include: IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the website.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Cookies</span></p>

            <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.</p>

            <p>We use cookies on application websites that we present on behalf of our clients. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use session ID cookies, and do not use persistent cookies.</p>

            <p>We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as logging in, will be limited.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">3rd Party Cookie</span></p>

            <p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</span></p>

            <p>Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/ Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>

            <p>Technologies such as scripts and tags from service providers are used in various places throughout our site(s) for the purpose of gathering basic analytics information about visitors. Some of this is used by our company for analyzing trends in site use and we may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by those same companies on and individual as well as aggregated basis. The information provided does not identify individual users.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Analytics / Log Files</span></p>

            <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically through service providers and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>

            <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, to gather information about our user base as a whole, and to comply with other security requirements that we adhere to. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Information Related to Data Collected through the Veracross Platform Service</span></p>

            <p>Veracross collects information under the direction of contracted educational institutions, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Choice</span></p>

            <p>The Veracross Platform Service collects information for our Clients; if you are a user of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Service Provider, Sub-Processors/Onward Transfer</span></p>

            <p>Veracross may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Access to Data Controlled by our Clients</span></p>

            <p>Veracross has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes through the Veracross Platform Service. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to the individual Veracross Client. If the Client requests Veracross to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 business days.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Data Retention</span></p>

            <p>Veracross will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. Veracross will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Use of your Personal Information</span></p>

            <p>We collect and use personal information to operate our website(s) and to deliver the services you have requested or on behalf of our Clients. If you are a direct Client or prospect we may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Veracross. If you are a direct Client we may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered. The use of information collected through the Veracross Platform Service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the educational intuition has engaged Veracross.</p>

            <p>We do not sell, rent or lease customer lists or any of your personally identifiable information to third parties.</p>

            <p>If you are a direct Client or prospect we may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. For certain sensitive information (e.g., personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, or information pertaining to the sex life of an individual), we must obtain your affirmative consent (opt in) before such information may be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you through the exercise of an opt in choice. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Veracross, and they are required to maintain at least the same level of privacy protection that we maintain for your information.</p>

            <p>Veracross will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process, such as a subpoena, served on us or the site; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; and, (c) act under necessary circumstances to protect the personal safety of users, or the public.</p>

            <p>If Veracross is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Security of your Personal Information</span></p>

            <p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to help secure our platform and your personal information and to assist us in preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss, alteration and destruction of that information. When you enter sensitive information or login to our portal we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Nevertheless, no set of security safeguards is guaranteed to be impenetrable.</p>

            <p>We cannot and do not guarantee that communications to or from our website, or that data transmitted or stored on or through the website, are or will be totally secure from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction by third parties.</p>

            <p><span class="c2">Children</span></p>

            <p>Veracross is committed to protecting the privacy of children. This website is not designed or intended to attract anyone under age 18.
