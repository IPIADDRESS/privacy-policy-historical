We at Verisign are acutely aware of and sensitive to the privacy concerns of our subscribers and other visitors to our web site.

            <p>Verisign supports TRUSTe's comprehensive assurance process. In order to ensure compliance with its Privacy Program, TRUSTe monitors our site by conducting initial and periodic reviews and "seeding" (tracking unique identifiers in our site's database). TRUSTe also relies on online users to report violations of posted privacy statements or specific privacy concerns. If a TRUSTe participant is suspected of not conforming to the TRUSTe principles, TRUSTe will investigate the issue, which could result in penalties, additional audits, or revocation of the participant's right to use the TRUSTe trustmark. Extreme violations may even be escalated to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These enforcement measures are intended to provide some trusted assurances that you can rely on in this Privacy Statement.

            <h3>IV. USE OF COOKIES, OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES AND GATHERING OF STATISTICAL DATA</h3>
            <p>We use "cookies" and other statistical and tracking technologies as described in this Section. A cookie is a piece of information that our web site sends to your browser, which then stores this information on your system. Other statistical and tracking technologies, such as web beacons, clear gifs, HTTP headers, also work in ways that collect information about your visit and use of Verisign's websites. We use these technologies in four ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>To provide a service:</strong> A cookie may be used to provide you with a specific service. For instance, if you request our site to remember your login password or remember your profile in a response to a blog post, we deposit a cookie on your computer to facilitate that service. If you are logging into an access-controlled section of our site, we set a temporary session cookie to establish that you have been authenticated. The information contained in these cookies consists of random data that is used by the server to authenticate the browser requests to the server for that particular session. These cookies do not include any type of personally identifiable information. This bit of information is erased when you close your current browser window. If you choose not to accept a temporary cookie, you will not be able to navigate in these online applications.</p>
                    <p>We also use a cookie for when you visit our web site and request documentation or a response from us. When you are filling out a form, you may be given the option of having our Web site deliver a cookie to your local hard drive. You might choose to receive this type of cookie in order to save time in filling out forms and/or revisiting our web site. We only send this type of cookie to your browser when you have clicked on the box labeled "Please remember my information" or another box with an equivalent content when submitting information or communicating with us.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>To facilitate website use:</strong> If a cookie is used, our web site will be able to remember information about your preferences and movement either until you exit your current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable or delete the cookie. For instance, we may deposit a cookie to remember which of Verisign’s regional websites you have selected to access. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a web site as seamlessly as possible. You should be aware that cookies are not able to "invade" your hard drive and return to the sender personal information from your computer. If you are accessing our services through one of our online applications our Web server may automatically send your browser a temporary cookie, which is used to help your browser navigate our site. The information contained in these temporary cookies is a direction value that lets our software determine which page to show when you hit the back button in your browser. This bit of information is erased when you close your current browser window.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>To understand our visitors:</strong> When you visit our site, our computers may automatically collect statistics in aggregate about visitor behavior. We may monitor statistics and other data such as how many people visit our site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, from which domains our visitors come, which browsers people use and how they move about our website. We use this data about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us to understand our visitors’ interests and improve the content and performance of our web site. If you come to our site from one of our business partners, our Web server may also send your browser a temporary cookie that reflects an origination code for that business partner. We use this information for statistical and marketing purposes.</p>
                    <p>We also use a cookie when we track traffic patterns on our site. Analysis of the collected information by our tracking technologies allows us to improve our web site and the user experience. In both instances of a persistent cookie, if you choose not to accept the cookie, you will still be able to use our web site. Even if you choose to receive this type of cookie, you can always set your browser to notify you when you receive any cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it in each situation in which one is sent. We may supplement this unidentified user data with other data to better understand our users. For instance, we may relate a user’s IP address to the company to which it relates to better understand our visitors’ interests.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>To advertise:</strong> We may tailor our advertisements to certain users based on the unidentified user data and related information. Also, we may receive information on unidentified users’ movements on other websites to tailor advertisements to them on our website and, likewise, provide unidentified user information to service providers, such as an ad agency, who places our advertisements on other websites to market to these users that visit them. You can opt out of this tracking by accessing the link below. You will need to invoke these opt-out procedures on each computer you use. If you opt out, you may still see Verisign advertisements on other websites you visit, but these ads are not user specific and are not placed because of your past website use. We will use commercially reasonable means not to set advertising cookies on the computers of users who appear to be located in the European Union and Switzerland at the time you access our website.</p></li>

            <p>We may use both temporary and permanent cookies based on the cookie’s purpose. A permanent cookie remains on your system, although you can always delete or disable it through your browser preferences.</p>
            <p>Third-party social media buttons displayed on our websites may record your IP address, browser type and language, access time and referring Web site addresses. When you are logged in to those social media sites, they also may link this collected information with your profile information on that site. We do not control these third party tracking technologies.</p>
            <h3>V. USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA</h3>
            <p>If you respond in a blog forum on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these blog forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Verisign is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. You are also responsible for using these forums in a manner consistent with the Rules of Engagement or other terms and conditions set forth on the relevant forum site.</p>
            <h3>VI. HOW WE USE AND WITH WHOM WE SHARE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE GATHER</h3>
            <p>We assure you that the personal information we gather from you is used by us only as explained below.</p>
            <p><strong>A. Sending You Responses and Updates</strong><br>We generally respond to any email questions, requests for product or service information, and other inquiries that we receive. We may also retain this correspondence to improve our products, services, and web site and for other disclosed purposes. Frequently we retain contact information so that we can send individuals updates or other important information about our services and products. Occasionally these updates or other important information may be sent out by third parties on our behalf. Please be assured that any third party who contacts you in this capacity has executed a confidentiality agreement with us that contains a provision ensuring the privacy and security of any transferred information and limits the third party's use of the shared information to sending updates or providing services on our behalf. Our subsidiary companies may also send you information about their services and products. In situations where you have supplied your information in connection with a question or request for information about a product or service offered by a Verisign business partner, we may also send the information you have supplied to the Verisign business partners that offer such products or services. Please be assured that these Verisign business partners have agreed to ensure the privacy and security of any transferred information and may only use the shared information to send you information about products or services about which you asked.</p>
            <p><strong>B. Facilitating the Support, Renewal, and Purchase of Our Products and Services</strong><br>We may use the information you submit to contact you to discuss the support, renewal, and purchase of our products and services. We may provide our subsidiary companies with your information so that they may send you information about their services and products. We may also provide the information you have submitted to us to a Verisign subsidiary, business partner, or independent reseller (either within or outside the United States) so that the subsidiary, business partner, or independent reseller can contact you and facilitate the support, renewal, and purchase of Verisign products and services. You may receive a communication directly from one of our subsidiaries, business partners, or independent resellers. Please be assured that any subsidiary, business partner, or independent reseller who contacts you for one of these purposes has agreed to use the information we supply only in accordance with a confidentiality agreement. To find out the names and locations of the subsidiaries, business partners, and/or independent resellers to whom we have provided your information, please contact us at the address given at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p>
            <p><strong>C. Disclosure by Law and Protection of Verisign and Others</strong><br>If we are required by law to disclose certain information to local, state, federal, national, or international government or law enforcement authorities, we will do so (for example, we may disclose the identity of purchasers of certain software products to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, as required under the terms of our export licenses). We will also disclose information to third parties as necessary in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Verisign may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply Verisign's agreements.</p>
            <p><strong>D. WHOIS Server</strong><br>In order to support security of the Internet, we are required to offer the WHOIS service with respect to the top-level domains (such as .com, .net, .tv, and .name) for which we are the registry. This service allows you or anyone else to determine the availability of domain names and the contact information for the registrar who registered a domain name on behalf of a registrant. In some instances, we are required to operate a "thick," or extensive, WHOIS service that typically contains the registrant’s name, contact person's name, address, telephone number, email address, and/or IP address as provided to us by the registrar for the domain name. Via the WHOIS service, this information may be disclosed to unaffiliated third parties in order to determine the registrant or the registrar in case of (i) technical problems that might occur when accessing its domain; (ii) assisting law enforcement authorities in investigations, crime prevention, and matters of national security; (iii) helping to counter the infringement of third-party legal rights; and (iv) preventing fraud. However, Verisign publishes only that data necessary for the purposes described above or when the registrant has agreed to the publication.</p>
            <p><strong>E. Business Transitions</strong><br>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Verisign decides to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize businesses or business units in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is Verisign's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>
            <p><strong>F. Surveys</strong><br>From time to time, we may request information from customers via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction with this web site, and improving our customer service and product offerings.</p>
            <h3>VII. YOUR ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF FURTHER NOTIFICATIONS</h3>
            <p>From time to time, we notify our subscribers of new products, announcements, upgrades, and updates. If you would like to opt out of being notified, please contact us at the address given at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p>
            <p>You can also <a href="/en_US/compref/index.xhtml">change your preferences online</a>. If you receive a marketing communication from our subsidiaries, business partners, or independent resellers, you should opt out with that entity directly. Please be aware that you may not opt out of receiving information regarding the security, initial use, expiration, product enhancement, or migration of our products or services.</p>
            <h3>VIII. OUR SECURITY PROCEDURES</h3>
            <p>We consider the protection of all personal information we receive from our web site visitors and subscribers as critical to our corporate mission. Please be assured that we have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any personal information we receive from you. As with any transmission over the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved in sending personal information. In order to try to minimize this risk, we encrypt all information that you submit in ordering one of our products or services using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Our security procedures are also subject to at least an annual SAS-70 Type II audit by an internationally recognized accounting firm.</p>
