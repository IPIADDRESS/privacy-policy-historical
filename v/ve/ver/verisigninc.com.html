            <p>Privacy is of great concern to most users of the Internet and is a critical part of an enjoyable and satisfactory user experience. We at Verisign are acutely aware of and sensitive to the privacy concerns of our subscribers and other visitors to our web site.

            <h3>II. Privacy Statement Enforcement</h3>
            <p>Verisign supports TRUSTe's comprehensive assurance process. In order to ensure compliance with its Privacy Program, TRUSTe monitors our site by conducting initial and periodic reviews and "seeding" (tracking unique identifiers in our site's database). TRUSTe also relies on online users to report violations of posted privacy statements or specific privacy concerns. If a TRUSTe participant is suspected of not conforming to the TRUSTe principles, TRUSTe will investigate the issue, which could result in penalties, additional audits, or revocation of the participant's right to use the TRUSTe trustmark. Extreme violations may even be escalated to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These enforcement measures are intended to provide some trusted assurances that you can rely on in this Privacy Statement. For more information on the TRUSTe assurance process, see <a href="http://www.truste.com/" target="_blank">TRUSTe's web site</a>.

Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a web site as seamlessly as possible. You should be aware that cookies are not able to "invade" your hard drive and return to the sender personal information from your computer. If you are accessing our services through one of our online applications our Web server may automatically send your browser a temporary cookie, which is used to help your browser navigate our site. The information contained in these temporary cookies is a direction value that lets our software determine which page to show when you hit the back button in your browser.

                <li><p><strong>To understand our visitors:</strong> When you visit our site, our computers may automatically collect statistics in aggregate about visitor behavior. We may monitor statistics and other data such as how many people visit our site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, from which domains our visitors come, which browsers people use and how they move about our website. We use this data about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us to understand our visitors’ interests and improve the content and performance of our web site.

Analysis of the collected information by our tracking technologies allows us to improve our web site and the user experience. In both instances of a persistent cookie, if you choose not to accept the cookie, you will still be able to use our web site. Even if you choose to receive this type of cookie, you can always set your browser to notify you when you receive any cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it in each situation in which one is sent. We may supplement this unidentified user data with other data to better understand our users. For instance, we may relate a user’s IP address to the company to which it relates to better understand our visitors’ interests.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>To advertise:</strong> We may tailor our advertisements to certain users based on the unidentified user data and related information.

            <p>If you respond in a blog forum on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these blog forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

            <h3>VI. How We Use and With Whom We Share the Personal Information We Gather</h3>
            <p>We assure you that the personal information we gather from you is used by us only as explained below.</p>
            <p><strong>A. Sending You Responses and Updates</strong><br>We generally respond to any email questions, requests for product or service information, and other inquiries that we receive. We may also retain this correspondence to improve our products, services, and web site and for other disclosed purposes. Frequently we retain contact information so that we can send individuals updates or other important information about our services and products. Occasionally these updates or other important information may be sent out by third parties on our behalf. Please be assured that any third party who contacts you in this capacity has executed a confidentiality agreement with us that contains a provision ensuring the privacy and security of any transferred information and limits the third party's use of the shared information to sending updates or providing services on our behalf. Our subsidiary companies may also send you information about their services and products. In situations where you have supplied your information in connection with a question or request for information about a product or service offered by a Verisign business partner, we may also send the information you have supplied to the Verisign business partners that offer such products or services. Please be assured that these Verisign business partners have agreed to ensure the privacy and security of any transferred information and may only use the shared information to send you information about products or services about which you asked.</p>
            <p><strong>B. Facilitating the Support, Renewal, and Purchase of Our Products and Services</strong><br>We may use the information you submit to contact you to discuss the support, renewal, and purchase of our products and services. We may provide our subsidiary companies with your information so that they may send you information about their services and products. We may also provide the information you have submitted to us to a Verisign subsidiary, business partner, or independent reseller (either within or outside the United States) so that the subsidiary, business partner, or independent reseller can contact you and facilitate the support, renewal, and purchase of Verisign products and services. You may receive a communication directly from one of our subsidiaries, business partners, or independent resellers. Please be assured that any subsidiary, business partner, or independent reseller who contacts you for one of these purposes has agreed to use the information we supply only in accordance with a confidentiality agreement. To find out the names and locations of the subsidiaries, business partners, and/or independent resellers to whom we have provided your information, please contact us at the address given at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p>
            <p><strong>C. Disclosure by Law and Protection of Verisign and Others</strong><br>If we are required by law to disclose certain information to local, state, federal, national, or international government or law enforcement authorities, we will do so (for example, we may disclose the identity of purchasers of certain software products to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, as required under the terms of our export licenses). We will also disclose information to third parties as necessary in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Verisign may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply Verisign's agreements.</p>
            <p><strong>D. WHOIS Server</strong><br>In order to support security of the Internet, we are required to offer the WHOIS service with respect to the top-level domains (such as .com, .net, .tv, and .name) for which we are the registry. This service allows you or anyone else to determine the availability of domain names and the contact information for the registrar who registered a domain name on behalf of a registrant. In some instances, we are required to operate a "thick," or extensive, WHOIS service that typically contains the registrant’s name, contact person's name, address, telephone number, email address, and/or IP address as provided to us by the registrar for the domain name. Via the WHOIS service, this information may be disclosed to unaffiliated third parties in order to determine the registrant or the registrar in case of (i) technical problems that might occur when accessing its domain; (ii) assisting law enforcement authorities in investigations, crime prevention, and matters of national security; (iii) helping to counter the infringement of third-party legal rights; and (iv) preventing fraud. However, Verisign publishes only that data necessary for the purposes described above or when the registrant has agreed to the publication.</p>
            <p><strong>E. Business Transitions</strong><br>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Verisign decides to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize businesses or business units in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is Verisign's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>
            <p><strong>F. Surveys</strong><br>From time to time, we may request information from customers via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction with this web site, and improving our customer service and product offerings.</p>
            <h3>VII. Your Ability to Opt Out of Further Notifications</h3>
            <p>From time to time, we notify our subscribers of new products, announcements, upgrades, and updates. If you would like to opt out of being notified, please contact us at the address given at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p>
            <p>You can also <a href="/en_US/compref/index.xhtml">change your preferences online</a>. If you receive a marketing communication from our subsidiaries, business partners, or independent resellers, you should opt out with that entity directly. Please be aware that you may not opt out of receiving information regarding the security, initial use, expiration, product enhancement, or migration of our products or services.</p>
            <h3>VIII. Our Security Procedures</h3>
            <p>We consider the protection of all personal information we receive from our web site visitors and subscribers as critical to our corporate mission. Please be assured that we have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any personal information we receive from you. As with any transmission over the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved in sending personal information. In order to try to minimize this risk, we encrypt all information that you submit in ordering one of our products or services using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Our security procedures are also subject to at least an annual SAS-70 Type II audit by an internationally recognized accounting firm.</p>
            <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at valuesandcompliance@verisign.com.
