<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="font-size:18pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none">Privacy Policy</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="text-decoration:none">Verbling.com is 
owned and operated by Fluency Forums Corporation ("Fluency Forums," 
"we," or "us").  We provide this Privacy Policy to explain 
our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection 
of information that apply </span>to our Service, as well as your choices 
regarding the collection and use of information. Capitalized terms that 
are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in 
our Terms of Use  <a href="http://verbling.com/landing/tos" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#0000ff">http://verbling.com/landing/<wbr>tos</span></a>. By using 
our Service, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this statement.  </p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none">What Information Is Collected?</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none">Personally Identifiable Information</span>: We collect Personally 
Identifiable Information (as defined below) only when you provide such 
information directly to us in connection with the Service. We ask for 
Personally Identifiable Information when you register for a User account 
with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will 
also retain our responses).  We may also retain any messages you 
send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in 
User Content you post to the Service. We may receive Personally Identifiable 
Information about you from third parties. For example, if you access 
our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, 
for example, through Facebook Connect, etc., that third party may pass 
certain information about your use of its service to Fluency Forums.  
This information could include any information that you have permitted 
the third party to share with us, and any information you have made 
public in connection with that service.  You should always review, 
and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites 
and services before linking or connecting them to our websites or Service. 
"Personally Identifiable Information" means any information that 
may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, 
a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, 
phone number or other contact information. </p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="font-weight:bold">Non-Personally Identifiable 
Information</span>:  We also collect and use information about 
your interactions with the Service in a manner and format that does 
not identify you as an individual ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information").   
We may collect, use, and disclose the following types of Non-Personally 
Identifiable Information:</p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;margin-left:36pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none">Analytics information</span>.  We use third-party analytics tools 
to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.  These 
tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page 
request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your 
browser's width and height, and other information that assists us 
in improving the Service.  We may collect and use this analytics 
information together with your Personally Identifiable Information to 
build a broader profile of our individual Users so that we can serve 
you better.</p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;margin-left:36pt"><span style="font-weight:bold">Cookies information</span>:  
When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies -- a small 
text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters -- to your 
computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Fluency Forums 
help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.  
A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service 
(e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you 
take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track 
your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on 
your hard drive after you close your browser.  Persistent cookies 
may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.  
Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's 
directions.  A session cookie is temporary and disappears after 
you close your browser.  You can reset your web browser to refuse 
all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, 
some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability 
to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;margin-left:36pt"><span style="font-weight:bold">Log file information</span>:  
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each 
time you access a web page.  When you use our Service, our servers 
automatically record certain log file information.  These server 
logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet 
Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and 
URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, 
domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;margin-left:36pt"><span style="font-weight:bold">Clear gifs/web 
beacons information</span>:  When you use the Service, we may employ 
clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously 
track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously.  In addition, 
we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to 
track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.  
The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of 
the Service.</p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;margin-left:36pt"> </p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none">How Is Such Information Used?</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none">Personally Identifiable Information</span>: We may use the Personally 
Identifiable Information we collect or receive to communicate directly 
with you. We will occasionally email you updates about technology, announce 
new features, remind you of events, or inform you about other important 
news. You always have the option to unsubscribe to these messages. We 
also use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you Service-related 
emails (e.g., account verification,  changes/updates to features 
of the Service, technical and security notices).  You may not opt 
out of Service-related e-mails. </p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="font-weight:bold">Non-Personally Identifiable 
Information:</span>  We use or may use cookies, log file, and clear 
gifs information to:  (a) remember information so that you will 
not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit 
the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; 
(c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor 
aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic 
patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently 
access your information after you sign in; and (h) to provide advertising 
to your browser or device.</p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none">Is The Information Shared or Disclosed?</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none">Personally Identifiable Information</span>:  We will not rent 
or sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties outside

We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third-party 
business partners for the purpose of providing the Service to you (e.g., 
email providers, server providers, etc.).  Those business partners 
will be given limited access to the Personally Identifiable Information 
that is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service, and we will require 
that such third parties comply with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;margin-left:36pt"><span style="font-weight:bold">Who you may 
choose to share your Personally Identifiable Information with</span>:  
Any Personal Identifiable Information or content that you voluntarily 
disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available 
to the public.  If you remove information that you posted to the 
Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of 
the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.</p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;margin-left:36pt"><span style="font-weight:bold">What happens 
to your Personally Identifiable Information in the event of a change 
of control</span>:  We may buy or sell/divest the company, or any 
combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses.  
Personally Identifiable Information such as customer names and email 
addresses, User Content, and other User information (and Non-Personally 
Identifiable Information) related to the Service will likely be among 
the items transferred in these types of transactions.  We may also 
transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, 
mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions or similar transactions 
or proceedings.</p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt;margin-left:36pt"><span style="font-weight:bold">Instances where 
we are required to share your Personally Identifiable Information</span>:  
We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information where required 
to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action 
is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests 
of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use <a href="http://verbling.com/landing/tos" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#0000ff">http://verbling.com/landing/<wbr>tos</span></a>, or to protect the security or integrity of our 
Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or 
personal safety of Fluency forums, our Users or others.</p>
<p style="margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:5pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</span>:  We may share 
Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including information obtained 
through tools such as cookies, log files, and clear gifs (such as anonymous 
usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of 
clicks, etc.): (i) in any manner permitted for Personally Identifiable 
Information; and (ii) with our third-party business partners.  
We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying 
characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with 
third parties.  </p>
