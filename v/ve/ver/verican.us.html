<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
    At Verican, we take your privacy very seriously. We are NOT in the business of selling,
    renting or disclosing your personally identifiable information to others. We have created
    this statement to describe our commitment to your privacy.
</p>

<h2>What information do we gather and track?</h2>

<p>
    We record IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track sessions on our site. Tracking
    gives us an idea of which parts and pages of our site users are visiting, how often they visit them,
    and how long they spend there. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This
    means that even if your session is tracked, you still remain anonymous. We also track browser type
    and platform. We use this information to deliver customized information specific to a particular platform
    and to determine the "mix" of browser types accessing our site. This information helps us make our site
    operate correctly with your browser. However, if you:
    </p><ul>
        <li>Purchase a product from Verican</li>
        <li>Sign up for a mailing list or enter a contest</li>
        <li>Fill out a survey, or sign onto a page that requires authorization</li>
        <li>Or enter into any other transaction with us,</li>
    </ul>
    you may be asked to provide us your name, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, postal address,
    credit card number (for purchases), and possibly other personal information. Additional demographic
    information may be optionally requested in order to improve our service to our customers. We may use
    the information you provide to:
    <ul>
        <li>Keep you informed of new releases of our products.</li>
        <li>Provide helpful hints and tips on how to use our products.</li>
        <li>Make special offers that we extend only to our registered customers.</li>
        <li>Improve our site and the services we offer you.</li>
    </ul>
    In limited cases, we may share your registration information (name, address, etc.) with the manufacturer
    of a product you purchase from us of -- but only when we inform you in advance of your purchase of the
    particular product.
<p></p>

<h2>Cookies and how we use them</h2>

<p>
    Cookies are unique text files that are sent to your browser from a Web server. As you browse our web site,
    cookies are placed on your computer's hard drive to track the method of your referral to our site and whether
    you downloaded demo software and/or purchased software. The usage of these cookies is generally not linked to
    any personally identifiable information; however, if you demo or purchase a product from our web site, we may
    keep a record of how you reached our site to help us understand your interests and thereby serve you better.
</p>

<h2>How do we use the information we gather and track?</h2>

<p>
    The information collected may be used for processing orders, personalizing the shopping experience, contests,
    promotions, newsletters, announcements, special offers, etc.
</p>

<h2>With whom may we share your information?</h2>

<p>
    We may collect, create and disclose to third parties aggregated, anonymous statistics regarding our sales,
    traffic analyses and other information regarding or collected through our web site. This information won't
    include inpidually identifiable data about you. We may also sometimes engage agents or contractors to
    perform services necessary to our operations (for example, delivery of products, distribution of e-mail, etc.).
    When we do, we may give them access to name, addresses or other information necessary for them to do their job
    for us, but not for any other purpose.
</p>

<p>
    In limited cases when you buy a product from us, we may share your registration information (name, address, etc.)
    with the manufacturer of that product so they can get in touch with you. We will inform you in advance of any
    particular purchase for which such sharing will occur so you can decide whether you still want to make the purchase
    or to look at the manufacturer's privacy policy before deciding. Finally, in the event our company or its assets
    were ever sold, our customer database naturally would be transferred to the new owner. Except as described above,
    and except as may be required by law, we will not disclose your personally identifiable information to others
    without
    your consent.

<h2>Choose or Opt-Out</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Announce Lists:</strong> You can subscribe or unsubscribe from any of our product announce lists. These
    announce lists will be used to send subscribers any announcements (product upgrades, special offers, etc.) relevant
    to the list to which they are subscribed.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Registered Verican Customers:</strong> Registered customers who do not wish to receive product announcements
    or special offers can contact Verican to update their account accordingly.
</p>

<h2>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h2>

<p>
    If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire our
    service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us.
    This can be accomplished by contacting Verican via e-mail, fax, phone or mail communication.
</p>

<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>

<p>
    This Verican site contains links to other Web sites. Although we do not provide any personally identifiable
    information to these companies, we cannot guarantee your privacy once you leave the Verican site. We are not
    responsible for the privacy policies, practices or content of web sites with links on our site. We encourage
    you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any web site.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
    We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your
    information is protected both online and offline.
</p>

<p>
    Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and
    transmitted to using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock
    icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
    However, some firewalls and certain versions of browsers don't permit communication through secure servers.
</p>

<p>
    While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information
    offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer
    service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store
    personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>
    In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user
    is required to give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact
    you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest.
</p>

<h2>Orders</h2>

<p>
    We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact information
    (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This
    information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we'll
    use this information to contact you.
</p>

<h2>Surveys &amp; Contests</h2>

<p>
    From time-to-time our site requests information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or
    contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this
    information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and
    demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners
    and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and
    satisfaction of this site.
