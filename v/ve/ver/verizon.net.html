TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Please be assured that we do not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. This means that you can visit our Web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself (such as your e-mail address, software you are using, or any information about yourself). </font>
<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">As you browse the site, our web servers collect information about 
                your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs, we 
                monitor statistics such as:</font></p>
              <ul><li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">How many people visit our site</font></li>
              	<li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Which pages people visit on our site</font></li>
              	<li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">From which domains our visitors come (e.g., aol.com)</font></li>
              	<li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Which browsers people use to visit our site</font></li></ul>
<p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">None of this information is associated with you as an individual 
                (see information about <a href="#whatarecookies">cookies</a> below). 
                We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its 
                performance, and to make the Web site easier for you and other 
                visitors to use.

</font></p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What about pages that ask for personal information?</b></font>
<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific 
                purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide 
                the service or information the visitor has requested). </font>
</font></p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product or service, receive information, manage online account registration, or apply for a job. The information may range from your zip code, to your phone number, account number, a credit card number, age, gender, mother's maiden name, social security number, e-mail address, organization URL, resume, or mailing address. </font></font></p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">
<p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">When visitors use our Web site to order services, we may use this individually identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. </font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Should any changes be made in the way we use personally identifiable information, Verizon will contact you via email notifying you of this change and to give you the opportunity to choose to opt-out of such use.</font></p>

<p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What happens to information when I fill out registration forms?</b></font>
<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">We encourage all visitors to register with us, although registration is only required for certain transaction-related areas of Verizon.com or other Verizon or co-branded sites. The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address are used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. You may change your email, user ID or password online; or you can choose to remove your name from our user list by going to <a href="/contact/">Contact Us</a> and emailing us a request to remove your name from the online billing application.</font>
</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">For our local phone service customers, you may also be given the option of registering a profile with us (limited to specific areas). This would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time by either going to <a href="/contact/">Contact Us</a> and emailing us your request, or in some applications you can cancel/change your profile within the application itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">We strive to ensure that the information we obtain and use about 
                customers is accurate. Please <a href="/contact/">notify 
                us</a> to review or modify any personal information we have previously 
                collected from you online or if you find an error in your bill. Customers 
                have access to their account information via our monthly bills.  
                 To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide 
                to expand the site's capabilities for obtaining information about 
                users in the future. We will update this privacy statement continually 
                to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.</font></p>

<p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Do you sell or give my information to non-Verizon companies?</b></font>
<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">We do not sell or disclose individually-identifiable information obtained online about our visitors, to anyone outside of Verizon unless you specifically authorize it, it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property. If you provide individually identifiable information to us in the context of an event Verizon sponsors with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing the individually identifiable information to the co-sponsor. For example, on Verizon co-branded sites, our partner will generally co-own the customer information received through the site. How the partner uses this information will be explained in the privacy statement at the co-branded site, which will govern the use of data gathered through the co-branded site. </font>
</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Verizon may share non-personally identifiable information with non-Verizon companies in order to assess the results of a promotion or event. This information is used in aggregate only, and does not contain any information that would personally identify you. </font>  

</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Does this site send e-mail to site visitors?</b></font>
<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">At times, online surveys are conducted in which you can choose to participate. In addition, we may use e-mail to communicate with our customers, to respond to visitors' e-mail, to confirm orders placed online, and to send information that a visitor has requested. Occasionally, we may use opt-in e-mail lists from third parties to promote our latest specials. If you receive an unwanted e-mail from us, you can use the Reply feature on your browser and simply ask us to remove you from our list. </font>

</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What is Verizon's position regarding online advertising and third party ad servers?</b></font>
<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">As part of the online advertising process, we use information supplied from third party companies in several ways however, <u>this is aggregated data and does not personally identify any individual online user</u>. This data is used to:</font>
</p><ul><li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">gain a better understanding of the type of individuals viewing or visiting different web sites,</font></li>
<li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">evaluate and prioritize site selection when developing online media plans,</font></li>
<li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">geographically target advertising, </font></li>
<li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">deliver product and pricing advertising/information applicable to the customers' state, and gauge the effectiveness of our online advertising.</font></li></ul>
<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number or email address is <u>not</u> collected. </font>
<p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, some Verizon websites may accept advertisements from third party advertisers. These advertisers are carefully selected to provide information about products and services that we think may benefit Verizon customers. These third party advertisers may collect non-personally identifiable information about users of this website for the same reasons listed above, but personally identifiable information is <u>not</u> collected. Verizon does not have control of nor access to any information contained in the cookies that are set by third party advertisers.</font>

</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Non Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically</b></font>
<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Cookies help Verizon to enhance the user's online experience and are used to:</font>
</p><ul><li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">deliver the appropriate geographic message</font></li>
<li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">manage frequency of ad exposure; avoid over delivery of the same message </font></li>
<li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">tailor an advertisement to better match your interests and preferences</font></li>
<li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live</font></li>
<li><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">understand advertising effectiveness</font></li></ul>
<p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. To disable cookies, <a href="#cookielink">click here</a>.</font>
</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>However, you need to understand that some websites/adserving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the adserving company/network, and specifically provide personal data.</b></font>
</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent adserving companies from reestablishing history on a visitor. The visitor must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely.</font>
</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Customers who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a web site attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie.</font>
</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Customers who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie. </font>

</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></font>
<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Personal information voluntarily supplied by customers who get information or purchase Verizon products on our website or as a result of interacting with our banners/advertising on outside websites <u>is not shared for use outside Verizon</u>. This information is Verizon proprietary data and is not available to any outside company in this personalized form. No outside company is allowed access to this information.</font>
</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">For example, if you enter your phone number and email address and ask to be contacted when DSL is available in your area, we will notify you when DSL is available, but we will not use this information for any other reason nor will we share it with any outside company.</font>
</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">Should any changes be made in the way we use personally identifiable information, Verizon will contact you via email notifying you of this change and to give you the opportunity to choose to opt-out of such use.</font>

</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Does Verizon use the information provided online to profile its customers?</b></font>
<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">The combination of offline and online information provided by the customer has the ability to enhance the customer experience, and make the consumer's interaction with Verizon more meaningful and relevant. Verizon requires notification of any consumer profiling or purchasing behavior being captured by Verizon online and combined with offline information be clearly stated to the consumer at the time of online data collection. The consumer will have the ability to choose not to have that information aggregated and be part of subsequent marketing campaigns by choosing to be identified within the application.</font>

<br><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">We may disclose personal information when required by law or when neccessary to protect the safety of our customers, employees or property.</font>
