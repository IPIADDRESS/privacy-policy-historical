						<p>Policy effective date: May 30, 2002</p>

						<p>Verizon (the company formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE) respects your 
						right to privacy. We adhere to a set of 
						<a href="http://www22.verizon.com/About/Privacy/genpriv/">privacy principles</a> 
						which form the basis of our privacy policy. When you visit this site you may provide 
						information on two different levels about your visit:</p>
						
						<ul>
						<li>Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site, and</li> 
						<li>Personal information you knowingly give us.</li> 
						</ul>
						
						<p>We want you to be aware of what information we collect, and how we handle this 
						information.</p> 

						<p align="center"><a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/trust_click.gif" border="0" width="91" height="73"><br></a></p>
					
						<p><span class="topic">What it means to me for Verizon to be 
						a TRUSTe licensee?</span></p> 
						

						<p>This confirms that Verizon is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an 
						independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence 
						in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site 
						wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its 
						information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance 
						by TRUSTe.</p>
						
						<p> When you visit a web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be 
						notified regarding:</p> 
						
						<ul>
							<li>What identifiable information is collected about you</li> 
							<li>What organization is collecting the information</li> 
							<li>How the information is used</li> 
							<li>With whom the information may be shared</li> 
							
							<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution 
							of the information</li> 
							
							<li>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or 
							alteration of information under the company's control, and</li> 
							<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first 
						<a href="/contact/">Contact Us</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your 
						inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then 
						contact <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html" target="_blank">TRUSTe</a>. 
						TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.</p> 
						
						                                              
						<p><span class="topic">What information does the Web site 
						gather?</span></p> 
						
						<p>Please be assured that we do not collect personal information from you unless you 
						provide it to us. This means that you can visit our Web sites without telling us who 
						you are or revealing any information about yourself (such as your e-mail address, 
						software you are using, or any information about yourself).</p>
						
						<p>As you browse the site, our web servers collect information about your visit, not 
						about you personally. Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>How many people visit our site</li> 
							<li>Which pages people visit on our site</li> 
							<li>From which domains our visitors come (e.g., aol.com)</li> 
							<li>Which browsers people use to visit our site</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>None of this information is associated with you as an individual 
						(see information about <a href="#whatarecookies">cookies</a>. We use these 
						statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make 
						the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use.</p> 
					
						<ul>
							<li>What about pages that asks for personal information?</li> 
							<li>When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use 
							the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the 
							visitor has requested).</li> 
						</ul>
						
						<p>For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product 
						or service, receive information, manage online account registration, or apply for a job. 
						The information may range from your zip code, to your phone number, account  number, a 
						credit card number, age, gender, mother's maiden name, social security number, e-mail 
						address, organization URL, resume, or mailing address.</p> 
						
						<p>When visitors use our Web site to order services, we may use this individually identifiable 
						information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic 
						manner. For example, to publish your name, address, and phone  number in our directories 
						(unless you have requested a non-published number), or to evaluate your service needs and 
						contact you regarding additional services you may find useful.</p> 
						
						<p>Should any changes be made in the way we use personally identifiable information, 
						Verizon will contact you via email notifying  you of this change and to give you the 
						opportunity to choose to opt-out of such use.</p>
						
						<p><span class="topic">Network Performance and Your Internet Connection</span></p>
						
						
						<p>Verizon automatically measures and monitors network performance and the performance of your Internet connection in order to improve the level of your service. Verizon also will access information about your computer's settings in order to provide customized technical support. You can be assured that no adjustments to your computer settings will be made without your permission, which you give at the time that the adjustments are being made, and which you can revoke at any time. Verizon does not share information collected for the purpose of network or computer performance monitoring or for providing customized technical support outside of Verizon or its authorized vendors, contractors and agents.</p>   

						
						<p><span class="topic">What happens to information when I 
						fill out registration forms?</span></p>
						 
						<p>We encourage all visitors to register with us, although registration is only required 
						for certain transaction-related areas of  Verizon.com or other Verizon or co-branded 
						sites. The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail 
						address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address 
						are used to send you information  about our company, product updates, special offers, 
						and newsletters. You may change your email, user ID or password online; or you can choose 
						to remove your name from our user list by going to <a href="/contact/">Contact Us</a> 
						and emailing us a request to remove your name from the online billing application.</p> 
						
						<p>For our local phone service customers, you may also be given the option of 
						registering a profile with us (limited to specific areas). This would store your name, 
						purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase  
						products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time 
						by either going to <a href="/contact/">Contact Us</a> and emailing  us your request, 
						or in some applications you can cancel/change your profile within the application 
						itself.</p>
						
						<p>We strive to ensure that the information we obtain and use about customers is accurate. 
						Please <a href="/contact/">notify us</a> to review or modify any personal information we 
						have previously collected from you online or if you find an error in your bill. Customers 
						have access  to their account information via our monthly bills. To improve the services 
						we can offer you, we may decide to expand the site's capabilities for obtaining information 
						about users in the future. We will update this privacy statement continually to ensure that 
						you are aware of developments in this area.</p>
						
						<p><span class="topic">Do you sell or give my information to 
						non-Verizon companies?</span></p> 
						 
						<p>We do not sell or disclose individually-identifiable information obtained online about 
						our visitors, to anyone outside of Verizon  or its authorized vendors, contractors and 
						agents unless you specifically authorize it, it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary 
						to protect the safety of our customers,  employees or property. If you provide individually 
						identifiable information to us in the context of an event Verizon sponsors with another 
						company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may 
						also be providing the individually identifiable information to the co-sponsor. For example, 
						on Verizon co-branded sites, our partner will generally co-own the customer information 
						received through the site. How the partner uses this information will be explained in the 
						privacy statement at the co-branded site, which will govern the use of data gathered through 
						the co-branded site.</p> 
						
						<p>Verizon may share non-personally identifiable information with non-Verizon companies in 
						order to assess the results of a promotion or event. This information is used in aggregate 
						only, and does not contain any information that would personally identify you.</p> 
						
						<p><span class="topic">Does this site send e-mail to site 
						visitors?</span></p> 
						
						<p>At times, online surveys are conducted in which you can choose to participate. In 
						addition, we may use e-mail to communicate with our customers, to respond to visitors' 
						e-mail, to 
						confirm orders placed online, and to send information that a visitor has  requested. 
						Occasionally, we may use opt-in e-mail lists from third parties to promote our latest 
						specials. If you receive an  unwanted e-mail from us, you can use the Reply feature on 
						your browser and simply ask us to remove you from our list.</p> 
						
						<a name="whatarecookies"></a><p><span class="topic">What 
						are cookies and why do you use 
						them?</span></p> 
						
						<p>A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that 
						contains your unique User ID for our Web site. We use cookies to deliver web content 
						specific to your interests, to keep track of your order as you order services, and to 
						control access to our premium content. A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise 
						compromise the data on your hard drive. You can choose to change your browser settings 
						to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique Verizon.net 
						User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on 
						this Web site, such as ordering in our online store. To disable cookies, 
						<a href="#cookielink">click here</a>.</p> 
						
						<p><span class="topic">Do you accommodate links to other 
						sites?</span></p> 
						 
						<p>This Web site contains links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the content 
						or the privacy practices employed by other sites. We are committed to safeguarding customer 
						privacy on all our Web sites. We require our employees to protect the  privacy of information 
						about our customers and expect our partners and suppliers to do so as well. You can feel 
						confident that your individually identifiable information will be protected when you access 
						your account or order services from us over the Internet.</p> 
						
						<p><span class="topic">What is Verizon's position regarding 
						online advertising and third party 
						ad servers?</span></p> 
						
						<p>As part of the online advertising process, we use information supplied from third party 
						companies in several ways however, <u>this  is aggregated data and does not personally 
						identify any individual online user</u>.<br> This data is used to:</p> 
						<ul>
						<li>gain a better understanding of the type of individuals viewing or visiting different 
						web sites,</li> 
						<li>evaluate and prioritize site selection when developing online media plans,</li> 
						<li>geographically target advertising,</li> 
						<li>deliver product and pricing advertising/information applicable to the customers' state, 
						and gauge the effectiveness of our online advertising.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number or email address 
						is not collected.</p> 
						
						<p>In addition, some Verizon websites may accept advertisements from third party advertisers. 
						These advertisers are carefully selected to provide information about products and services 
						that we think may benefit Verizon customers. These third party advertisers may collect 
						non-personally identifiable information about users of this website for the same reasons 
						listed above, but personally identifiable information is not collected. Verizon does not 
						have control of nor access to any information contained	in the cookies that are set by 
						third party advertisers.</p> 
						
						<p><span class="topic">Non Personally Identifiable Information 
						Collected Automatically</span></p> 
						                
						<p>Cookies help Verizon to enhance the user's online experience and are used to:</p> 
						
						<ul>
							<li>deliver the appropriate geographic message</li> 
							<li>manage frequency of ad exposure; avoid over delivery of the same message</li> 
							<li>tailor an advertisement to better match your interests and preferences</li> 
							<li>ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state 
							in which you live</li> 
							<li>understand advertising effectiveness</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable 
						you to erase cookies from your  computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a 
						warning before a cookie is stored. To disable cookies, 
						<a href="#cookielink">click here</a>.</p>
						
						<p>However, you need to understand that some websites/adserving companies have the 
						ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same 
						site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the adserving company/network, 
						and specifically provide personal data.</p> 
						
						<p>Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent adserving companies from reestablishing 
						history on a visitor. The visitor must either continue to decline cookies each time it 
						reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out,  
						your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. 
						This new cookie tells websites that   you have opted out and they will then know not to 
						attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a 
						unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer 
						uniquely.</p> 
						
						<p>Customers who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their 
						browser advise them each time a web site attempts to send a cookie to your system. At 
						that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie.</p> 
						
						<p>Customers who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non 
						personally identifiable cookie.</p> 
						
						<p><span class="topic">Personally Identifiable 
						Information</span></p> 
						
						<p>Personal information voluntarily supplied by customers who get information or purchase 
						Verizon Online products on our website or as  a result of interacting with our 
						banners/advertising on outside websites is not shared for use outside Verizon or its 
						authorized vendors, contractors and agents. This information is Verizon proprietary data 
						and is not available to any outside company in this personalized form, except with customer's 
						permission or where disclosure is otherwise required by law. No outside company is allowed 
						access to this information.</p> 
						
						<p>For example, if you enter your phone number and email address and ask to be contacted when 
						DSL is available in your area, we will notify you when DSL is available, but we will not 
						use this information for any other reason nor will we share it with any outside company.</p> 
						
						<p>Should any changes be made in the way we use personally identifiable information, 
						Verizon will contact you via email notifying you of this change and to give you the 
						opportunity to choose to opt-out of such use.</p> 
						
						<p><span class="topic">Protection Of Children's Personal 
						Information</span></p>
						
						<p>Verizon Services, including Verizon Online services, are not designed to attract 
						children under the age of 13.  Although we do feature sites that may be of interest to 
						young viewers, we do not collect personally identifiable information on children. Further, 
						Verizon offers tools for parents to educate young Internet users on safe surfing practices, 
						including filtering tools to help children and parents avoid objectionable content online.  
						GetNetWise.org and SafeKids.com are two sites that offer tools for providing information on 
						safe Internet usage. For more information, go to the "Family Online Safety Guide" on our 
						homepage.</p>    
						
						<p><span class="topic">Does Verizon use the information provided online to profile 
						its customers?</span></p> 
						
						<p>The combination of offline and online information provided by the customer has the 
						ability to enhance the customer experience, and make the consumer's interaction with 
						Verizon more meaningful and relevant. Verizon requires notification of any consumer  
						profiling or purchasing behavior being captured by Verizon Online and combined with 
						offline information be clearly stated to the consumer at the time of online data 
						collection. The consumer will have the ability to choose not to have that information 
						aggregated and be part of subsequent marketing campaigns by choosing to be identified 
						within the application.</p> 
						
						<p><span class="topic">Please note</span></p>
						 
						<p>We may disclose personal information when required by law or when necessary to protect 
						the safety of our customers, employees or property.</p> 
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">SECURITY ISSUES</span></p>
						
						<p><span class="topic">How do I know I am on a secured 
						site?</span></p>

						disclosing personal information in theses areas.</p>
						
						<p><span class="topic">What information is stored by the 
						site or in cookies?</span></p>

						are not stored by the Verizon site. They are stored in the Verizon databases, physically
