   					   Last Updated: August 25, 2009</p>

   					<p><strong>Our Commitment To Privacy</strong><br>
					   Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we
					   provide this notice explaining our online information practices and
					   the choices you can make about the way your information is collected
					   and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make links available to
					   it on our homepage and at points where personal information may be
					   requested. Vera&nbsp;Bradley reserves the right to change, modify, add to
					   or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page
					   periodically for any changes. Privacy Policy changes will apply to the
					   personal information collected from the date of posting of the revised
					   Privacy Policy to Vera&nbsp;Bradley's website.</p>

					<h4>Information Collected</h4>

					<p><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
					   Vera&nbsp;Bradley collects personal information from our visitors on a
					   voluntary basis. We may request personal information about you in
					   connection with your use of, or participation in, our website,
					   including through discussion/social networking forums, registrations,
					   store purchases, content submissions, contests, sweepstakes,
					   promotions and requests for additional information or suggestions, or
					   in connection with other services or resources provided on the site.
					   Personal information may include name, address, email address, phone
					   number, birth date, occupation, credit card account data and other
					   purchasing information. You may also provide us with photographs or
					   other video/media content which may contain personal information.
					   Unless specifically stated, we do not require this information to
					   obtain access to our site. The personal information we collect is used
					   by Vera&nbsp;Bradley only for the specific purpose for which it is
					   submitted. For example:</p>
					
				<ul>	
					<li>

					<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> 
					   On some pages our visitors can submit comments or ask questions. We
					   also collect personal information when you send us emails containing
					   questions or requests. We only save personal information associated
					   with questions and requests in our customer service database (unless
					   otherwise stated herein, data which does not expire and is retained)
					   in order to respond to those questions and requests, and to better
					   serve you when responding to any questions or requests you may have in
					   the future.</p>
					
					</li>
					<li>
					   
					<p><strong>Catalog Requests:</strong> 
					   The names and mailing addresses submitted by visitors who request a
					   printed catalog are used to mail the catalog and may also be shared
					   with your Favorite Store, or with our marketing partners to provide
					   you with additional information or products we think may be of
					   interest to you. If you would like to remove your name and address
					   from our catalog mailing list, please send an email to
					   <a href="mailto:customercare@verabradley.com">customercare@verabradley.com</a>. Please include your full name, email
					   address and phone number in case we have questions.</p>
					
					</li>
					<li>
					   
					<p><strong>Email Newsletters:</strong> 
					   Some of our pages allow visitors to register to receive periodic email
					   newsletters or updates from us by providing an email address. Any
					   email you receive from Vera&nbsp;Bradley will allow you to "unsubscribe"
					   from this informational service at any time.</p>
					
					</li>
					<li>
					  
					<p><strong>Club Vera Profile:</strong> 
					   The Club Vera member service collects some personal information in
					   order to save preferences and Wish List information. On occasion, we
					   may use this information to offer products or information that we
					   think may be of interest to our customers (most of our customers enjoy
					   receiving such material).</p>

					<p>The Club Vera member service also allows you to register for emails
					   reminding you of new products or special promotions. In addition, if
					   you have made a purchase and register it with Club Vera, we may send
					   you content-specific newsletters or special information about other
					   Vera&nbsp;Bradley products via email in the future. On occasion, we also
					   may send information or offers to Club Vera members on behalf of other
					   companies or organizations, such as Vera&nbsp;Bradley Retail Stores or the
					   Vera&nbsp;Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer.</p>

					<p>If you prefer not to receive the information or offers described
					   above, please 1) follow the instructions in the email to
					   "unsubscribe;" 2) send a postcard or letter to Vera&nbsp;Bradley Customer
					   Service, 2208 Production Road, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46808; or 3) send
					   an email to <a href="mailto:customercare@verabradley.com">customercare@verabradley.com</a>, and we will remove your name
					   from our email mailing list. Please include your full name, email
					   address and phone number in case we have questions. It may take
					   several days to process your instructions, and you may receive
					   messages after submitting your instructions.</p>
					
					</li>
					<li>

					<p><strong>Email a Friend:</strong> 
					   There are some features on our website that may require visitors to
					   enter another person's personal information and/or email address in
					   order to use the feature. We only use this information to allow
					   visitors to share certain website content with friends.</p>
					
					</li>
					<li>
					   
					<p><strong>Discussion/Social Networking Forums:</strong> 
					   Our website may offer discussion forums, message boards, social
					   networking opportunities, chat pages and other public forums or
					   features in which you may provide personal information, materials and
					   related content. If you submit personal information when using these
					   public features, please note that such personal information may be
					   publicly posted and otherwise disclosed and used without limitation or
					   restriction.</p>
					
					</li>
				</ul>
					   
					<p><strong>Non-personal Information</strong><br>
					   Vera&nbsp;Bradley collects a variety of non-personal information from
					   visitors to our website. This data is not personally identifiable and
					   is collected automatically via the use of cookies (small computer
					   files saved on your hard drive) and other standard web technology.
					   Automatically-collected information may include: the operating system
					   on your computer, the type of web browser you are using, your IP
					   address, and the links you followed to enter and leave the site.</p>
					
					<p>Vera&nbsp;Bradley's web servers collect the domain names of visitors to our
					   website, however, they do not recognize individual email addresses.
					   Aggregate information showing the IP addresses and/or domain names of
					   visitors, the number of visits, average time spent on the website,
					   pages viewed, etc. is collected and used only for internal review to
					   measure the overall use of our website and provide direction for its
					   continuous improvement. This information is not sold to or shared with
					   other organizations for commercial purposes.</p>

					<p><strong>Privacy of Children</strong><br>
					   Vera&nbsp;Bradley provides additional privacy protections when children
					   visit the website. We do not knowingly collect, maintain or store
					   personal information from or about children under the age of 13
					   without a parent's and/or legal guardian's consent, except in
					   limited circumstances authorized by law and described in this notice.
					   IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18, PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY WITH A
					   PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN. IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13, YOU SHOULD
					   GET YOUR PARENT'S OR LEGAL GUARDIAN'S PERMISSION BEFORE GIVING
					   OUT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>

					<p>Vera&nbsp;Bradley does not require disclosure of personal information on
					   our websites. A child can visit our sites or certain sections of our
					   sites directed to children without ever registering or providing
					   personally identifiable information. However, our sites may contain
					   special features, forums and clubs requiring registration. For
					   example, special features open to children may require registration by
					   a parent or legal guardian. Details on the information we require to
					   register, as well as any rules or restrictions, are available at the
					   designated registration areas. Only visitors who are 18 or older may
					   purchase products from our online stores.</p>

					<p>We offer our child visitors opportunities to share their ideas and
					   interests through online forums and other content features. We may
					   also ask a child to voluntarily provide a first name, age, birth date
					   and state when submitting a response to one of our site features or
					   promotions. We will not ask a child for more information than is
					   reasonably necessary for the child to participate in the activity. We
					   may even use a stage or screen name before any responses are posted to
					   our website. We will also obtain parental consent before using
					   photographs of children or knowingly accepting online registrations of
					   children.</p>
					   
					<p>We do not collect personal information from children under the age of
					   13 without their parent's/legal guardian's consent except in
					   special, limited circumstances:</p>
					
					<ul>
					   <li>If we offer an e-mail newsletter or similar feature, we will ask for
					   the child's e-mail address and first name, and also ask for a
					   parent's/legal guardian's e-mail address for purposes of opting
					   out/unsubscribing.</li>
					   <li>For promotions, contests and other similar activities, Vera&nbsp;Bradley
					   will not ask for more information than is necessary for the child to
					   participate in the activity. If your child participates in the
					   promotion or contest activity, we will notify you and generally ask
					   that you provide the information instead of your child. Any
					   information that you (or your child) submits to Vera&nbsp;Bradley will be
					   deleted from our database after (i) the promotion or contest is
					   concluded; and (ii) any legally required period for retaining the data
					   is complete.</li>
					</ul>
					   
					<p>Parents/legal guardians may review personal information we have
					   collected about their child, request deletion, or refuse to allow
					   further collection or use of the information by emailing Customer
					   Service at <a href="mailto:customercare@verabradley.com">customercare@verabradley.com</a>.</p>

					<p><strong>Health Information</strong><br>
					   The Vera&nbsp;Bradley website is not intended to or designed to solicit
					   personal health information. We do not collect personal health
					   information.</p>
					
					<h4>Sharing of Information</h4>
					   
					<p>We may share your personal information under the following
					   circumstances (i) you have given us your email address during account
					   registration and/or online store checkout process: we may share that
					   email address with your Favorite Store, or with our marketing partners
					   to provide you with additional information or products we think may be
					   of interest to you; (ii) vendors need the information to perform
					   necessary duties (e.g. credit card authorization); or (iii) disclosure
					   of information is required by law.</p>
					
					<p>At times, we employ other companies and individuals to perform certain
					   functions on our behalf. Examples include removing repetitive
					   information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing
					   marketing assistance. Using contractual or other arrangements, Vera
					   Bradley will ensure that these agents, contractors and third party
					   service providers, who may receive personal information in the course
					   of providing services to Vera&nbsp;Bradley, protect the personal
					   information in a manner consistent with the principles set out in this
					   Privacy Policy.</p>
					
					<p>Vera&nbsp;Bradley may also disclose personally identifiable information
					   based on a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to
					   conform to or comply with the law or that such disclosure is necessary
					   to protect our website visitors or the general public.</p>
					   
					
					<h4>Our Commitment to Data Security</h4>
					   
					<p>Vera&nbsp;Bradley utilizes appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
					   procedures to guard our online visitors' personal information against
					   unauthorized access and use, including Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
					   encryption technology to protect credit card data transmission during
					   online store purchases. All information is protected by Vera&nbsp;Bradley's
					   security measures, which are periodically reviewed.</p>
					   
					<h4>Links</h4>
					   
					<p>Vera&nbsp;Bradley's website may contain links to other sites, and we make
					   every effort to only link to sites that share our high standards and
					   respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content
					   or the privacy practices employed by other sites.</p>
