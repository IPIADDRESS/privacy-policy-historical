<h3><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<br>
<p>Effective date: January 03, 2013</p>
<br>
<p>Welcome to Verzend.be. We provides a fast way to deliver large files to email</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work   with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our   mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection   with Verzend services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</li>
  <li>User Content that you make publicly available   through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this   Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use <br>(which can be found at <a href="http://verzend.be/tos.html">http://verzend.be/tos.html</a>).</li>
  <li>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>Important Notice:</b> Please note that we always do our utmost best to respect and protect our users privacy. However, we hope you understand that in case a suspicious keyword is found or when a file is 
downloaded an usual amount of times, we are obliged to investigate the file it concerns. This in order to be compliant with laws to prevent illegal file-distribution.<br><br>

If in any of the above cases it seems to concern an actual suspicious or illegal file, Verzend will immediately take action by deleting the file(s) it concerns and blocking the user account that is
responsible for uploading the files.<br><br>

In case this action turns out to be accidental or ineligible we kindly request our users to let us know by filling out a counter-notice. Whenever we receive a counter-notice we will look into the matter as
soon as possible and do our utmost best to re-activate the user account as soon as the investigation is completed.<br><br>

<h3> <strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></h3><br>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Verzend account.</li>
  <li>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g.,   first and last name).</li>
  <li>User Content ( pictures,comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</li>
  <li>Communications between you and Verzend. For example, we may send   you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates   to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that   you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and   usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by   your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons,   and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We   collect and use this analytics information with analytics information   from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any   particular individual User.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Cookies and similar technologies: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar   technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect   information about how you use Verzend and provide features to you.</li>
  <li>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to   your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by   us or the third party.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each   time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It   can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is   downloaded to your browser or device.</li>
  <li>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain   log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol   ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of   clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names,   landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also   collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then   help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by   recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and   improvement of the Service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our   Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or   remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are   small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with   your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A   device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device   hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system   or other software, or data sent to the device by Verzend.</li>
  <li>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third   party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us   or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features   of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of   device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User   Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a   piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</li>
  <li>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content   including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo),   geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data.   This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more   interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's   APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and   searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is   made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</li>
</ul><br>
<h3><strong>2.  HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></h3><br>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe   in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</li>
  <li>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;</li>
  <li>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing</li>
  <li>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</li>
  <li>develop and test new products and features</li>
  <li>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</li>
  <li>diagnose or fix technology problems</li>
  <li>automatically update the Verzend application on your device   Verzend or other Users may run contests, special offers or other   events or activities ("Events") on the Service. If you do not want to   participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.   hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</li>
</ul><br>
<h3> <strong>3.  SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></h3><br>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside   Verzend (or the group of companies of which Verzend is a part)   without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We may share User Content and your information (including but not   limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers,   location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of   the same group of companies that Verzend is part of, or that become   part of that group ("Affiliates").  Affiliates may use this information   to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by   providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by   providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But these   Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your   photos.</li>
  <li>We also may share your information as well as information from tools   like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with   third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you   ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to   your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under   reasonable confidentiality terms.</li>
  <li>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with   third-party advertising partners. This information would allow   third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted   advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</li>
  <li>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share   anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information   with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with   you and share that aggregated information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting   to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public,   as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set.

You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or   transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this   Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a   legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we   have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may   include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the   United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is   required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that   jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized   standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we   have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address   fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others,   including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent   bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed   and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a   legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or   investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies,   or otherwise to prevent harm.</li>
