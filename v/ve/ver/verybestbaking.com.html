    <a name="ApplyTo"></a>1. What does this Privacy Notice apply to?</h3>
<p>
    This Privacy Notice applies to information that we collect from or about our consumers
    through the methods described below.
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Notice does NOT apply to information collected by our affiliate companies,
    or joint venture partners.</p>
<p>
    Please note we may combine information that we collect via one method (e.g., a website)
    with information that we collect via another method (e.g., an offline event). We
    do this to get a more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us
    to serve you better and with more customization.

<h3>
    <a name="WhatCollect"></a>2. What information do we collect?</h3>
<p>
    Depending on how you interact with Nestlé USA (online, offline, over the phone,
    etc.), we may collect from you various types of information (personal and aggregate),
    as described below.
</p>
<p>
    Personal information (as used in this Privacy Notice) refers to such types of information
    that can be used to personally identify you, whereas aggregate information does
    not allow for such identification.</p>
<p>
    In some instances (and unless we say otherwise below), we may combine/link one type
    of information with another type of information (e.g., personal contact information
    with account login and/or demographic information), and store them together in our
    records. We strive to limit the amount of information we collect and store to that
    which is reasonably necessary to provide you the relevant services. We generally
    store your information for as long as your account is active with us or as needed
    to provide you the relevant services. We may store your information for a longer
    period of time to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes,
    enforce our agreements, or for records management purposes.
</p>
<p>
    <i><u><a name="PersonalContact"></a>Personal contact information</u></i></p>
<p>
    This includes any information that would allow us to personally contact you, such
    as your name, home or mailing address, phone number (home, cell, etc.), or email
    address. In some cases, this could include personal information that you give us
    about someone else (for example, if you provide a friend’s email address for a tell-a-friend
    program). We typically collect personal contact information in connection with a
    variety of activities, including general website registration, newsletter sign-up,
    <a href="#WebsiteCommunity">website community features</a>,online purchases,<a href="#CustomerService">
        customer service inquiries</a>,<a href="#ContestsPromos"> contests and other promotions</a>,
    and consumer surveys. If you create an account with us, your personal contact information
    may be stored under your account profile.</p>

    <a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p>
    <i><u><a name="AccountLoginInfo"></a>Account login information</u></i></p>
<p>
    This refers to any information that is required for you to establish a unique account
    with us or for us to give you access to your specific account profile. Examples
    may include your login ID/email address, screen name, password, and/or security
    question and answer. We only collect unique login information for those activities
    that require an account, such as general website registration, newsletter sign-up,
    and <a href="#WebsiteCommunity">website community features</a>. Your login information,
    especially your password, should be kept confidential and never shared with anyone
    else. To change your login email address or password, log in to the relevant edit
    account section of our site (if available), use the “forgot password” feature of

    Examples may include your date of birth, age or age range, gender, geographic location
    (e.g., zip code, city and state, mobile location), favorite products, hobbies and
    interests, and household or lifestyle information. We typically collect demographic
    information in connection with a variety of activities, including general website
    registration, newsletter sign-up,<a href="#WebsiteCommunity"> website community registration</a>,<a href="#ContestsPromos"> contests and other promotions</a>, and consumer surveys.
    If you create an account with us, you may be allowed to modify certain demographic
    information stored under your account. To do so, log in to the relevant edit account
    section of our site (if available) or contact <a href="#ContactInfo">Consumer Services</a>.

<p>
    This includes any information about the computer system or other technological device
    that you may be using to access one of our websites or applications. We typically
    collect this information through automated technologies such as cookies and web
    beacons. Examples of technical computer information may include your computer’s
    IP address, operating system type, and web browser type. If you access a Nestlé
    USA website or application via a mobile device such as a smartphone, the collected

    This includes information about how you use and navigate our websites and applications,
    including which links you click on, which pages or content you view and for how
    long, and other similar information and statistics about your interactions with
    a Nestlé USA website or application (e.g., date and time of visit, which site you
    came from, favorite recipes and site activities, high game scores, etc.). This information
    is captured using automated tracking technologies such as browser cookies, flash
    cookies, and web beacons, and may also be collected through the use of third party
    tracking services (such as Google Analytics) that collect data in aggregate (such
    as number of visits to a particular page, or the amount of time spent on a web site).
    We may also use these technologies, such as web beacons, to capture information
    about how users respond to certain email campaigns (e.g., time the email is opened,
    where user links to from the email, etc.). Please see <a href="#HowUse"><b>Question
        8</b>(“Tracking technologies – How and why do we use them?”)</a></p>
<p>
    Please note that “flash” cookies are different from “browser” cookies because of

    We collect personal information about users over time and across different websites
    when you use this website or service. We also have third parties that collect personal
    information this way. We use tracking tools to serve you with interest-based advertising
    and to better understand your behaviors and browsing activities. We might permit
    third parties to gather information passively on our websites, including for behavioral
    advertising purposes. We partner with a third party ad network to either display
    advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network
    partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information
    about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising
    based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the
    purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com">
        here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.
    You will continue to receive generic ads. You can control tracking tools. In particular,
    your browser gives you the ability to delete or reject browser cookies. If you block
    cookies, certain features on our website may not work. Some browsers have a “Do
    Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your
    online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so note that our
    systems may not recognize Do Not Track headers or signals from some or all browsers.
    If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in
    this Privacy Notice will stop.</p>

    address, gender, birthday, current city, profile picture, user ID, list of friends,
    etc.) and any other additional information or activities that you permit the third
    party social network to share with third party application developers. For example,

    you download or interact with a Nestlé USA web application on a social network such
    as Facebook or every time you use a social networking feature that is integrated
    within a Nestlé USA site (such as Facebook Connect). To learn more about how your

    email address) and information regarding the reason for your inquiry (e.g., order
    status, technical issue, product question/complaint, general question, etc.). Customer

    <a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p>
    <i><u><a name="ContestsPromos"></a>Contests and other promotions</u></i></p>
<p>
    We may collect and use your information to administer a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway,
    competition, or other similar marketing campaign or promotion. These events typically
    require the collection and use of <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a>
    (for prize fulfillment), <a href="#Demographic">demographic information</a> (for
    eligibility determination), and, in some instances, <a href="#ConsumerGen">consumer-generated

    such as Facebook (for example, on our Facebook fan pages). To comply with legal
    requirements, we may publish or share a limited amount of information (such as name

    <i><u><a name="MarketingCommunications"></a>Marketing communications</u></i></p>
<p>
    We may collect and use your information to send you marketing communications, such
    as email communications, SMS text messages, and postal mailings. Please note that
    if you choose to receive SMS text messages, your plan fees for messaging will apply.
    We may also show you marketing communications on other websites, including on social
    media sites where you are a member, by matching activities or information collected
    on our websites with those collected on third party sites (“Targeted Advertising”).These
    marketing communications will keep you up-to-date on the latest news, events, special
    offers, and promotions from the Nestlé USA brands of interest to you. On occasion,
    these communications may also introduce you to other Nestlé brands and inform you
    about offers and promotions from other third party companies. Sending you marketing
    communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain <a href="#PersonalContact">
        personal contact information</a> and <a href="#Demographic">demographic information</a>.
    In some instances (such as for mobile apps and text messaging programs), this could
    involve the use of your precise geo-location, which may allow us to send you location-based
    offers and promotions.</p>
<p>
    You can always opt-out from receiving marketing-related email communications or
    text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication.
    If you have an account with us, you may be given the option to change your communication
    preferences under the relevant edit-account section of our site (if available) or
    by contacting <a href="#ContactInfo">Consumer Services</a>. Changing these preferences
    would also remove you from our lists for future Targeted Advertising. You may also
    visit social media sites where you are a member to explore opt out options they
    may provide for Targeted Advertising. Please note that even if you opt out from
    receiving marketing communications from us, you may still receive administrative
    communications from us, such as order confirmations, notifications about your account
    activities (e.g., account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and other important
    announcements. You will also still see generic ads on other websites, including
    on social media sites where you are a member.</p>
<p>
    Also, please note that if you participated in a promotion that involved a third
    party company, and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future marketing
    communications directly from that third party, you will need to contact the third
    party (not Nestlé USA) to opt-out from such communications. This process may be
    outlined in the third party’s privacy policy.</p>

    networking features such as “Facebook Connect” or “Facebook Like”. These features
    may be integrated in our sites or applications for the purposes of running contests,
    allowing you to share content with friends, or other stated purposes. If you use
    these features, we may have the ability to obtain certain information about you
    from your social networking profile (see “<a href="#SocialNetworkInfo">Social network
        information</a>” under Question 2 of this Privacy Notice). You can learn more

    technologies (such as cookies, see <b>Question 8</b>) that collect and remember
    certain <a href="#AccountLoginInfo">account login information</a>, <a href="#TechnicalComputerInfo">
        technical information</a>, and/or previous <a href="#WebsiteUsageInfo">website usage

    can easily retrieve the items you previously placed in your shopping cart. Based
    on this type of information, we may also show you specific Nestlé USA content or
    promotions that are tailored to your interests.</p>

<p>
    <i><u><a name="WebsiteCommunity"></a>Website community features</u></i></p>
<p>
    We may collect and use your information to give you access to website community
    features, including features that may allow you to upload and share recipes, pictures,
    videos, artwork, or other messages or content. This typically involves the collection,
    use, and (in some instances) public display of certain <a href="#PersonalContact">personal

    <a href="#Demographic">demographic information</a>, and/or <a href="#ConsumerGen">consumer-generated
        content</a>. Because these features are “communal” in nature, information or
    content that you post in these areas may be visible to others. Please use caution
    when using these features or uploading content to a Nestlé USA site. For some community
    features, we may give you the ability to control whether some parts of your profile
    can be seen by others. To access these settings, log in to the relevant edit account
    section of our site (if one is available) and access your community profile. For

<p>
    We may request and use your information so you can use website viral features, such
    as our tell-a-friend features. These features allow you to easily share certain
    Nestlé USA news, product information, promotions, wish list items, or other content
    with family members and friends. These features typically require the collection
    and use of <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a> (such as
    names and email addresses) so that the selected one-time message or content can
    be delivered to the proper recipients. In most cases, we do not retain the information
    provided. In some cases (for example, as part of a refer-a-friend program), we may
    store the information so we can track and reward consumers for their successful
    referrals. For tell-a-friend or other viral features administered by third party
    social networks (such as Facebook’s “Share” and “Like” features), please refer to

    inform you about the status of your orders. This could involve the collection and
    use of certain personal contact information, <a href="#PaymentInfo">payment information</a>,
    <a href="#AccountLoginInfo">account login information</a>, and/or other information
    related to your purchase (such as products ordered). This could also involve the
    ongoing storage of your <a href="#PaymentInfo">payment information</a> to allow
    for easier checkout on future purchases.</p>
<p>
    Please note that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestlé products
    but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé USA. Because these sites may have
    different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies
    before making any purchases on those sites.</p>

<p>
    We may collect and use your information for other general business purposes, such
    as to maintain the day-to-day operation and security of our websites and applications

<h3>
    <a name="protectperinfo"></a>4. How do we protect your personal information?</h3>
<p>
    We use a variety of standard methods (described below) to help keep consumer information
    confidential and secure. Please note, however, that these protections do not apply
    to information you choose to share in public areas such as our <a href="#WebsiteCommunity">
        website community features</a> or other social areas.</p>
<p>
    <i><u>Secure operating environments</u></i></p>
<p>
    We store your information in secure operating environments that are protected from
    the public and that we only allow authorized Nestlé USA employees and agents/contractors
    to access on a need-to-know basis. We follow generally accepted industry standards
    to protect personal information; however, no method of transmission over the Internet,
    or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee
    its absolute security.</p>
<p align="right">
    <a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p>
    <i><u>Encryption for payment info</u></i></p>
<p>
    We use industry-standard encryption to provide greater protection for sensitive
    financial information, such as credit card information, sent to us over the web.
    For example, encryption is used when you make payments through our online stores.
    Please note, however, that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell
    Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé USA. Because these
    sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their
    privacy policies before making any purchases.</p>
<p>
    <i><u>Prior authentication for account access</u></i></p>
<p>
    We require our registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g., login ID/email
    address, password) before they can access or make changes to their account information.
    This helps prevent unauthorized access to your account.</p>
<p align="right">
    <a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p>
    <i><u>Measures we expect you to take</u></i></p>
<p>
    It is important for you to also play a role in keeping your information safe and
    secure. When signing up for an online account, please be sure to choose an account
    password that is hard for others to guess and never reveal your password to anyone
    else. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID/email
    address or password remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time
    you leave the computer. You should also make use of any privacy settings or controls
    we may provide you in our website community areas.</p>

<h3>
    <a name="RefuseProvideContactInfo"></a>5. What happens if you refuse to provide
    your personal information?</h3>
<p>
    If you choose not to submit any personal information when requested, you may not
    be able to participate in certain activities and personalized features and may limit
    the services and special offers we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to
    share your email address, you will not be able to receive any of our newsletters
    or otherwise register on our websites or use our applications. If you refuse to
    provide your credit card number, you will not be able to purchase products at a
    Nestlé online store. However, to simply browse our websites and learn more about
    our products, you do not need to give us any personal information.</p>

<h3>
    <a name="discloseurinfo"></a>6. Who do we disclose your information to and why?</h3>
<p>
    Nestlé USA will not share your personal information with any third party that intends
    to use it for direct marketing purposes unless we have specifically informed you
    and you have given us specific permission to do this.
</p>
<p>
    We may share your personal information with our subsidiary companies, companies
    in which Nestlé S.A. has control through either direct or indirect ownership (collectively
    “Nestlé Group”). Nestlé USA may also share your personal information with third
    parties, but only in the following circumstances:
</p>
<p>
    <i><u>Service Providers, Agents and Contractors</u></i></p>
<p>
    We may use third parties, like service providers, agents or contractors to provide
    support for the internal operations of our websites and applications and to assist
    us with administering our websites and applications or the various functions, programs
    and promotions available to you. Some of these third parties may be located outside
    the country where you accessed this website. These third parties and its employees
    may come into contact with your personal information in the course of providing
    their services to us. Any such third party must at all times provide the same levels
    of security for your personal information as Nestlé USA and, where required, are
    bound by a legal agreement to keep your personal information private, secure and
    to process it only on the specific instructions of Nestlé USA.</p>
<p align="right">
    <a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p>
    <i><u>Partners and Joint Promotions</u></i></p>
<p>
    From time to time, we may run a joint or co-sponsored program or promotion on our
    website or application with another company, organization, or other reputable third
    party; and, as part of this event, collect and process personal information. If
    your personal information is being collected by (or is shared with) a company other
    than Nestlé USA as part of such promotion, we will let you know this at the time
    your personal information is collected. Periodically, we may run a promotion on
    our website or application that features the products or services of another company
    and will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive information directly from
    that third party company. When doing any promotion involving another company, we
    may provide a separate link to that company's privacy policy and we encourage you
    to read it before you share any personal information, as we cannot guarantee they
    adhere to the same privacy practices. If you do not want your information to be
    collected by or shared with a company other than ours, you can always choose not
    to opt in or participate in these events at the time the personal information is
    collected/requested.</p>
<p align="right">
    <a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p>
    <i><b>Your California Privacy Rights</b></i></p>
<p>
    If you are a California resident, you may have the right to request and receive
    certain information about our disclosure of your personal information to third parties
    for their own marketing use, and your choices with respect to such disclosures.
    Because we do not share your personal information with third parties for their own
    marketing use unless you are first given the opportunity to opt-in or out (as set
    forth above), we are exempt from having to meet this requirement. If you still wish
    to learn more about our compliance with this requirement, you may contact <a href="#ContactInfo">
        Consumer Services</a>.</p>
<p align="right">
    <a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p>
    <i><u>Legal and Business Transfers</u></i></p>
<p>
    We may also disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law,
    or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply
    with legal processes, to respond to any claims, or to protect the safety or rights
    of Nestlé USA, its customers, or the public.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a merger or acquisition of all or part of Nestlé USA by another
    company, or in the event that Nestlé USA were to sell or dispose of all or a part
    of the Nestlé USA business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained
    by that Nestlé USA business, which could include personal information. Similarly,
    personal information may be transferred as part of a corporate reorganization, insolvency
    proceeding, or other similar event, if permitted by and done in accordance with
    applicable law.

    We may share aggregated demographic or survey information with third parties, but
    this information is in anonymous form and does not contain any personal information.
    The aggregate information that we share may include anonymous information that is
    captured through the use of cookies and other similar tracking technology, as explained

<h3>
    <a name="TrackingTechnology">8. Tracking Technology – How and why do we use them?</a></h3>
<p>
    Nestlé USA does make use of tracking technologies (“Cookies”, “IP Addresses”, Log
    Files”, “Web Beacons”) to gather certain information such as browser type and operating
    system, referring page, path through site, domain of ISP etc. for the purpose of
    improving the use and functionality of our websites and other purposes described
    below. Tracking technologies help us tailor our websites to your personal needs.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>
    We use Cookies to improve the use and functionality of our websites and to better
    understand how visitors use our websites and the tools and services offered on it
    and to communicate elsewhere on the web. The storage of Cookies on your computer
    provides an easy and convenient way for us to personalize or enhance your experience
    on our websites and to make your next visit more enjoyable.</p>
<p>
    <b>IP Addresses</b></p>
<p>
    We may keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to (among other things): (i)
    troubleshoot technical concerns, (ii) maintain website safety and security, (iii)
    restrict access to our websites to certain users, and, (iv) better understand how
    our websites are utilized. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on
    the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Log Files</b></p>
<p>
    We (or a third party on our behalf) may collect information in the form of logs
    files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing
    habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help us gather (among other
    things) (i) a user’s browser type and operating system, (ii) information about a
    user’s session (such as the URL they came from, the date and time they visited our
    website, and which pages they've viewed on our website and for how long), and, (iii)
    other similar navigational or click-stream data. We also use information captured
    in log file for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly
    improve and customize the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally
    only, and are not associated with any particular user.</p>
<p>
    <b>Web Beacons</b></p>
<p>
    We may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our websites or include them in the e-mail
    messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as “web bugs”) are small strings of
    code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an
    email message for the purpose of transferring data back to us. The information collected
    via web beacons may include some of the information described in the IP Address
    section directly above, as well as information about how a user responds to an email
    campaign (e.g., the time the email is opened, where does the user link to from the
    email, etc.). We use web beacon information for a variety of purposes, including
    but not limited to, site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and
    email auditing and reporting, and personalization.

        e-mails?</a></h3>
<p>
    Spamming is where unsolicited e-mails are sent to you containing advertisements
    or marketing related materials without your consent.</p>
<p>
    We do <b>NOT</b> send spam e-mails. Sending e-mails without consent is illegal in
    many countries. We will not use your personal information (including your e-mail

    information from a child below 13, we will remove that child’s information from
    our records as soon as feasibly possible. However, we may collect personal information
    about children below the age of 13 for marketing purposes from the parent or legal
