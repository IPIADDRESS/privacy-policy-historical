						<h3><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<p>Vertical Insider LLC (“Vertical Insider”) is committed to protecting the privacy of the companies that register and use our Website (“Users”) and the information they provide to us. This Privacy Policy outlines important information regarding the use and disclosure of all User information provided to Vertical Insider’s Website. Vertical Insider provides this Privacy Policy to help Users make an informed decision as to whether to use or continue using the Website.</p>
<p>Vertical Insider is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, contact Vertical Insider Support at&nbsp;<u>privacy [at] verticalinsider.com</u></p>
<h4><strong>General</strong></h4>
<p>By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to any and all agreements entered into between Users and Vertical Insider. Your use of the Website and any information you provide via the Website or through other official Vertical Insider contact remains subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as any other governing Vertical Insider policies.</p>
<p>You are informed that any content posted by Users onto the Website becomes published or informational content, or the like, and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4><strong>Collected Information</strong></h4>
<p>Vertical Insider may collect personal information and data including, but not limited to, application and Website usage data, file transfer and viewing data, email and personal contact information, and other identifiable information provided to us by our Users. Vertical Insider may use technological means for tagging and tracking data including, but not limited to, harmless cookies, clear .GIFs, and other technologies to track and correlate data.</p>
<p>Specifically, but not limited to, the following information is collected:</p>
<ol>
<li>User Provided Data: Users may provide personally identifiable information (such as a name, credit card data, address, telephone, and an email address) as well as sensitive information (such as Tax ID or Social Security Number) to Vertical Insider when choosing to participate in the services and activities available on the Website (collectively, the “Services”).</li>
<li>Cookies: Cookies, a harmless small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters, are deployed to your computer so as to uniquely identify your presence and use. Vertical Insider may use session cookies and persistent cookies for the purpose of tracking various important data. Use of these cookies can also help to speed your access to the Website as they serve as ‘reminders’ as to who you are to our programming. While we recommend that you allow these cookies to perform their tasks, you may adjust your computer’s settings to restrict or refuse them. However, some features or sections of the Website may not function properly, or not all, if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. For more information, please view our <a href="https://verticalinsider.com/cookie-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cookie Policy</span></a> here.</li>
<li>Clear .GIFs: Vertical Insider may choose to utilize “clear .GIFs” to track the online usage patterns of our Users in a non-personally identifiable manner. Additionally, Vertical Insider may also use clear .GIFs in HTML-based emails dispatched to Users so as to track which emails are being opened by the recipients. This act helps Vertical Insider to determine active and inactive email addresses.</li>
<li>Log File Data: When Users log-in to their Vertical Insider account, our servers will automatically record and archive certain information that web-browsers send whenever visiting a website. These server logs may include information vital to validating the User’s authorization to access the account.

Further, and in order to provide the services and improve Vertical Insider’s websites, we may engage the services of third-party vendors. In the process of supplying services to Vertical Insider, these third-party vendors may need to collect Personal Information about you.</p>
