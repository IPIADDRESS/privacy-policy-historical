			If you're a local Verizon phone service customer, you may be given the option to register a profile with us (limited to specific areas).

			<span class="bodyCopy">We are committed to protecting the information you give us, so we implement the appropriate safeguards to do so. Any information that you give us is protected by a password with a minimum of six characters for added security. Within Verizon, your information is stored in password-protected, limited-access servers. Wherever possible, Verizon servers reside behind a corporate firewall that maintains tight controls on any access to the system from both our internal network and the Internet.  Verizon uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to transmit sensitive information such as credit card numbers and SSN.  SSL is a transport level technology for authentication and data encryption between a Web server and a Web browser.  SSL  sends data over the "socket" which is a secure channel at the connection layer.</span>

			<a name="secure2"></a><span class="bodyCopyBold">Does Verizon's Web site collect information from children?</span><br>
			<span class="bodyCopy">
			Verizon believes that protecting the privacy of children on the
Internet is very important.  The Verizon Web site is not designed to
attract children under the age of 13, and we do not intentionally
collect  personal information from children on our Web sites.  Ordering
online products and services is limited to adults 18 or over.
<br><br>
Children should exercise caution before providing personal information
online and should discuss with an adult or guardian before doing so.
Verizon also urges parents and guardians to consider using one of the
low-cost software programs designed to protect children while they are
online.

			A cookie is a small data string our server writes to your hard
			drive. This data string contains your unique user ID for our Web
			site. This technology also allows us to customize your experiences
			when you visit the Verizon Web site. For example, we're able to
			deliver content specific to your interests, keep track of your
			online ordering and alert you to new products or money saving
			opportunities based on your current services.

			<a name="Cookies3"></a><span class="bodyCopyBold">What information is collected  by the site or in cookies?</span><br>
			Verizon collects non-personally identifiable information regarding your visit, usually in the form of cookies, log files, or clear .gif files. Cookies contain a session identification number that our systems use to recall previous authentication or order information from our servers. We may also collect your domain name, IP address, the address of the last URL you visited prior to coming to our Web site, and your browser and platform type. We use third party tracking services to help us analyze this information in the aggregate to evaluate the effectiveness of our site. In some cases, the information is collected directly by the third party and in others it is forwarded by Verizon to the third party. The third party is not permitted to use the information for any other purpose.

			<a name="Ads2"></a><span class="bodyCopyBold">What is Verizon's position regarding online advertising and third-party ad servers?</span><br>
			<span class="bodyCopy">As an online advertiser, Verizon uses information supplied from third-party companies in several ways. This is aggregated data that does not personally identify any individual online user. This data is used to:</span>
			<ul class="bodyCopy">
				<li>Evaluate and prioritize site selection when developing online media plans</li>
				<li>Geographically target advertising</li>
				<li>Deliver product and pricing information applicable to the customer's state</li>
				<li>Gauge the effectiveness of our online advertising</li>
			</ul>
			<span class="bodyCopy">Again, personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address is not collected unless you voluntarily supply this data to Verizon or to a third party partner in order to get further information about Verizon products and services.
			<br><br>
			In addition, some Verizon Web sites -- for example, <a href="/Utilities/redirect/?target=http://www.superpages.com/" target="_blank">www.superpages.com</a> -- may accept advertisements from third-party advertisers. These advertisers are carefully selected to provide information about products and services that we think may benefit you. Please check the privacy policy of these Web sites concerning what information may be collected by third-party advertisers.
			<br><br>
			Third-party advertising companies may also utilize technology in order to measure the effectiveness of ads. Some Verizon Web pages contain clear .gif files (also known as Web beacons), electronic images that allow the third party to collect anonymous information. This anonymous information about your visits to our site is used to provide advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. No personally identifiable information is collected during this process.</span>
