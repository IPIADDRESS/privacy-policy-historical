The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address are used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. You may change your email, user ID or password online; or you can choose to remove your name from our user list by going to <a href="../support/contact.html">Contact Us</a> and emailing us a request to remove your name from the online billing application.</font>
</p><p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">For our local phone service customers, you may also be given the option of registering a profile with us (limited to specific areas). This would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time by either going to <a href="../support/contact.html">Contact Us</a> and emailing us your request, or in some applications you can cancel/change your profile within the application itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="2">We strive to ensure that the information we obtain and use about
