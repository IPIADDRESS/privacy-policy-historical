<h4>To Make Payments</h4>
<p>If you are a Registered User, you may purchase Services we offer for a fee, in accordance with our Terms and Conditions located at <a href="https://vydia.com/terms-and-conditions/">https://vydia.com/terms-and-conditions/</a>. For example, we may offer a paid storage plan. To process payments for such Services, we rely on a third party service provider (such as Braintree, PayPal or Tipalti) (<strong>“Payment Processors”</strong>). When you make a payment, the payment information is transmitted directly to the Payment Processor, and we do not have access to it, and take no responsibility for it.</p>
<p>Our Payment Processor will provide to us the Registered User’s name, mailing address, phone number, email address (if PayPal is used to process the payment), card type (i.e., Visa, Amex, etc.) and the credit card’s last four digits so we can comply with applicable legal obligations to “know our client” (sometimes referred to as “KYC”) and other legal obligations that apply to us.</p>
<h4>To Receive Payments</h4>
<p>If you are a Registered User and have signed up for our monetization services (pursuant to a separate mutually agreed content license agreement signed by you and us), you may earn a share of revenue from monetization of your content on Third Party Platforms. We issue applicable payments using our Payment Processors.</p>
<p>In this case, our Payment Processor will provide to us the Registered User’s name, mailing address, phone number, email address (if PayPal is used to process the payment), and tax information (such as a W9), so we can comply with our obligations to pay you, applicable legal obligations to “know our client” (sometimes referred to as “KYC”), withhold any applicable taxes (e.g., depending on the country of residency of the Registered User) and other legal obligations that apply to us.</p>
<p>If a Registered User decides to terminate his/her/ its Vydia account and cease using the Services, we will keep records of payments we receive from or make to such Registered User, in order to comply with our legal obligations.</p>

This information helps us understand how the individual reacts to our communications and limit the amount and nature of information provided.</p>

<h2>9. Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>In some countries, the law requires us to provide you with detailed information about the cookies that may be set when you visit our Site. The law may also require that we obtain your consent to the use of certain types of cookies. This cookie policy (<strong>“Cookie Policy”</strong>) aims to provide you with information about cookies, how we use them, and when applicable law how we request your consent.</p>
<h3>A – What are “cookies”?</h3>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are sent to a user’s browser by the website visited or when an email is opened. They are used for numerous different purposes, including to remember an individual’s actions and preferences (for example, login data, language, font size, other display settings, etc.), so that the individual does not have to configure them again when visiting again the website, or when moving from page to page within a website. Some operations within a website may not be able to be performed without the use of cookies which, in certain cases, are technically necessary for operation of the website. They may also contain a unique ID code that allows tracking a user’s browsing activities within a website, for statistical or advertising purposes.</p>
<p>Cookies are often divided in two categories, “session cookies” which are automatically deleted when you close your browser, and “persistent cookies” which remain on your device until their pre-set expiration period expires.</p>
<p>When browsing a website, you may receive first party cookies, which are sent by the website or third party cookies, which are sent from websites or web servers other than the website being visited.</p>
<p><strong>To learn more about cookies, you may wish to refer to.</strong></p>
<p>All About Cookies: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a></p>
<p>Cookie Central: <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/</a></p>
<p>Network Advertising: <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://networkadvertising.org/</a>.</p>
<h3>B – Individuals Located in the EEA</h3>
<p>Individuals <strong>located in the EEA may have the right to prohibit the use of certain cookies.</strong></p>
<p>For some types of cookies, the consent of the website user may not be necessary. This is the case for “technical cookies” which are only used to send messages through an electronic communication network, or are needed to provide the user with the service that the user requests: this includes browsing or session cookies, which are used to allow the user to login, and functional cookies, which are used to remember choices made by a user when accessing the website, such as language, fonts, settings, or to remember the products selected for purchase. These cookies are essential for the proper operation of the functions offered by the website.</p>
<p>Some cookies, known as “profiling cookies” are used to create profiles of users, and to send advertising messages to users in line with the user’s preference that may be inferred from the user’s browsing the website. Certain laws, such as laws that apply to individuals in the EEA, may require the affirmative consent of users.</p>
<h3>C – How We Obtain your Consent</h3>
<p>We are working on updating our Website to present you with a notice informing you that the Website uses cookies, in accordance with applicable law. That notice will include a link to this Cookie Policy. If the notice contains a request to agree to the use of our profiling cookies, we will use these cookies if you express your consent by clicking on the appropriate box. If you decide to continue through our website after being presented with that notice, without clicking on the appropriate box, we will assume that we do not have your consent to set cookies as described in this Cookie Policy.</p>
<p>Until we have updated the Website to present you with that notice, please send an email to us at <a href="mailto:support@vydia.com">support@vydia.com</a>, stating that you do not consent to our use of the cookies as described in this Cookie Policy.</p>
<h3>D – First Party Cookies</h3>
<p>The Website uses technical cookies for Website operations and to allow users to use the Website content and services, to activate Website functions, and to configure the Website according to the user’s choice, such as language or font size.</p>
<p>We also use analytics cookies, which allow us to understand how individuals use the Website and to track traffic to and from the Website, and profiling cookies to observe the user’s activities on the Website to infer the user’s preferences, and send advertising messages in line with these preferences.</p>
<h3>E – Analytics Cookies</h3>
<p>We use Google Analytics and Mixpanel, online, web-based, and mobile-based analytics services provided respectively by Google, Inc. (<strong>“Google”</strong>) and Mixpanel, Inc. (<strong>“Mixpanel”</strong>), to collect information about your use of the Services. Google, Mixpanel and other analytics services use cookies to collect information about the content you view, and your system information and geographic information.</p>
<p>The information generated by these cookies about your use of the Services will be transmitted to and stored by the applicable analytics services. The information collected by these analytics services allows us to analyze your use of the Services.</p>
<p>You can opt-out of Mixpanel’s automatic collection and retention of your data when you use the Services by visiting <a href="https://mixpanel.com/optout">https://mixpanel.com/optout</a>, however, if you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter you browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers) you may need to follow the Mixpanel opt-out process again to ensure your opt-out remains valid.</p>
<p>Information collected by the Google Analytics cookie is transmitted to, and stored by, Google in accordance with its privacy practices.</p>
<p>To see an overview of privacy at Google and how this applies to Google Analytics, please visit: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245</a>.</p>

<h3>F – Third Party Cookies</h3>
<p>We also use third party cookies, owned by third parties, which act either as independent data controllers or data processors regarding their own cookies.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising as explained below. The opt-out may be provided through specific opt-out cookies. Please note that:</p>

</ul>
