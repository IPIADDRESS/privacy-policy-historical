You control the sharing and distribution settings for the videos created by you according to the control settings you set for yourself. If you have elected to make your animations public, then other users will be able to see that you posted animations and view your animations.&nbsp; We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that might violate this Privacy Policy, the law or your personal privacy.&nbsp; If you or other users authorized on your account download or export a video, the resulting video file does not reside on our Site or Services and is no longer governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
