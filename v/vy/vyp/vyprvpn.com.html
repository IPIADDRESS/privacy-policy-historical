<h2>VyprVPN Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>What VyprVPN Collects From VPN Sessions:</h3>
<p>
VyprVPN records the following information for each VyprVPN session:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Date &amp; Time</li>
 <li>Duration</li>
 <li>Location</li>
 <li>Upload &amp; Download Bytes</li>
</ul>

<h3>How VyprVPN Uses Collected Information From VPN Sessions:</h3>
<p>
This data is maintained for use with billing, troubleshooting, service offering evaluation, TOS issues, AUP issues, and for handling crimes performed over the service. We maintain this 
level of information on a per-session basis for at least 90 days. We may keep upload &amp; download bytes at an aggregate level for longer periods of time.
</p>

<h3>What VyprVPN Does NOT Collect From VPN Sessions:</h3>
<p>
Beyond counting the number of bytes uploaded and downloaded, VyprVPN...
</p>
<ul>
 <li>...does not perform deep packet inspection of your traffic, except where requested by the customer for firewall purposes.</li>
 <li>...does not perform shallow packet inspection of your traffic, except where requested by the customer for firewall purposes.</li>
 <li>...does not discriminate against devices, protocols, or application. VyprVPN is network neutral.</li>
 <li>...does not throttle your Internet connection.</li>
 <li>...does not rate limit Internet connection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How VyprVPN Responds To Civil Investigations:</h3>
<p>
VyprVPN will not release a member's indentifying information  - minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more - or usage information to investigators, attorneys, or 
agencies unless we are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter.  If there is a hearing in court, the member will be notified so they will have an opportunity 
to contest the surrender of personal information.
</p>

<h3>How VyprVPN Responds To Criminal Investigations:</h3>
<p>
VyprVPN cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies, yet there must still be a subpoena before VyprVPN provides a member’s indentifying information - minimal information reasonably 
calculated to identify and no more.  In a criminal investigation VyprVPN is required by the Law to not divulge the fact of the investigation to the member.
</p>

<h3>What VyprVPN Collects From WWW.VyprVPN.COM:</h3>
<p>
VyprVPN collects personally identifiable information from end users only through voluntary web form submissions, primarily for the purpose of enabling the purchase of services and 
engaging in support and other conversation.  VyprVPN also collects anonymous information about how visitors use our web site; for example, VyprVPN utilizes web analytics software to 
track, in aggregate, the number of unique views received by the pages of the web site, the domains from which users originate along with many other analytical data points. Through the 
use of web analytics software, the VyprVPN.com website may use "cookies" to assist the tracking of how users engage our website. (A cookie is a piece of data that the web server stores 
on the browser's PC which the web browser will then send back to the web server on any future requests, to facilitate identification of the user should they visit the web site again). 
While much of the information that we collect from users in this manner is not personally identifiable, it may be associated with personally identifiable information that users 
voluntarily provide to us through our web site.
</p>

<h3>How VyprVPN Uses Information Collected From WWW.VyprVPN.COM:</h3>
<p>
VyprVPN does NOT use personally identifiable information collected through our Web site to contact users regarding products and services offered by VyprVPN.  We do NOT share a member’s 
personally identifiable information with affiliates, independent contractors, and business partners or outside entities for marketing purposes or otherwise. We hold your data private.
