	CondéNet Inc. and the Condé Nast Publications (the 
"Service Providers") understand and respect our customers' 
desire for privacy.  To that end, we would like you to know 
how we use the personal information you provide to us.
<p>
We collect certain information (e.g., name and address) that 
is necessary to fulfill magazine subscriptions.  This 
information is collected from all customers.  We collect 
other information (e.g., e-mail address or telephone 
number) so that we may more efficiently communicate with 
subscribers when necessary.  While we request that 
subscribers provide this information, it is not required.
</p><p>
Occasionally, we also attempt to collect demographic data 
from our subscribers (e.g. job, title, age, etc.).  This 
information is used by our editors to better understand our 
subscribers and by our advertisers to target their 
advertisements.  It is not required for magazine fulfillment 
and should be submitted at the subscriber's discretion.  In 
addition, we may place a "cookie" in the browser files of a 
user's computer.  The cookie itself does not contain any 
personally identifying information, but allows us to relate a 
user's use of our site to information that the user has 
specifically and knowingly provided.
</p><p>
All data entry forms are sent to a third party solely for 
purposes of fulfilling your order and processing your 
requested transaction.
</p><p>
Sometimes we also use and/or provide your personally 
identifiable information (excluding your credit card 
number) to third parties who we feel may have information of
interest to you.  If you prefer that we not use 
your information in this manner, send an e-mail request 
to the address below with your name, address, and publication title.
</p><p>
Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to use this site 
or make any purchases unless their parent or legal 
guardians provide their prior written (excluding e-mail) 
authorization to service providers.
</p><p>
If you have any additional questions or concerns pertaining 
to the privacy of information collected on this site, send an
e-mail to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@condenast.com">privacy@condenast.com</a>.
