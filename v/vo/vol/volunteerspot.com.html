	<h1>Your Privacy Rights — VolunteerSpot's Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>VolunteerSpot, Inc. (“VolunteerSpot”)  has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of consumer data  collected about you. This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 1, 2008. Any  questions regarding this policy should be directed by email to <a href="mailto:privacy@VolunteerSpot.com">privacy@VolunteerSpot.com</a>. The following discloses VolunteerSpot's  information gathering and dissemination practices for its marketing website. </p>
<h3>Information  Collected and Received</h3>
  <p>VolunteerSpot may  collect or receive information about each person who registers with the VolunteerSpot  website including, but not limited to, user name, password, first and last  name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, and interests. VolunteerSpot  also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may  volunteer, such as survey information. </p>
<h3>Uses of  Information</h3>
    <p><strong>WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS,  OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION, TO ANY THIRD PARTY. EVER. </strong></p>
  <p>Except as described in  this section, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party  without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an  opportunity to prevent your information from being shared.</p>
  <p>From time to time, we may partner with companies based on the  interests of our users. These partner companies will never see your email  address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact  you directly.</p>
  <p>Any exceptions to this policy of sharing your name, address or  email address with a partner company will be done only with your permission.</p>
  <p>VolunteerSpot reserves the right to disclose information when  required by law.</p>
  <p>We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary  to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies  may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those  companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;However, we will not be liable for any damages  that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these  companies.</p>
  <p>VolunteerSpot may use  your IP address to help diagnose problems with VolunteerSpot's server and to administer  VolunteerSpot's web site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you  and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
  <p>VolunteerSpot's site's  registration form requires users to give VolunteerSpot contact information  (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your  zip code, age, or income level). VolunteerSpot uses customer contact  information from the registration form to send the user information about VolunteerSpot  and promotional material from some of VolunteerSpot's partners. The customer's  contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. VolunteerSpot  may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor the visitor's experience on VolunteerSpot's  site, show the visitor content that VolunteerSpot thinks you may be interested  in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and  profile data will be shared with advertisers ONLY on an aggregate basis.</p>
  <p>We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, statements made by  our customers.</p>
  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>VolunteerSpot uses  industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged between VolunteerSpot and other companies to help ensure its  security. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse  and alteration of the information under VolunteerSpot's control. VolunteerSpot's  servers are backed up regularly and protected by security systems.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>  “Cookies” are small  pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard  drive. VolunteerSpot's site uses cookies to keep track of your session,  shopping cart, and advertising delivery. VolunteerSpot may also use cookies to  deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password. VolunteerSpot  may use an outside ad company to display ads on VolunteerSpot's site. These ads  may also contain cookies. While VolunteerSpot uses cookies in other parts of VolunteerSpot's  web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by VolunteerSpot's ad  company and VolunteerSpot does not have access to this information.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
  <p>VolunteerSpot may  create links to other web sites. VolunteerSpot will make a reasonable effort to  link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's  right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated or  authorized by VolunteerSpot may have links leading to VolunteerSpot's site. VolunteerSpot  cannot control these links and VolunteerSpot is not responsible for any content  appearing on these sites.</p>
<h3>Amendments</h3>
  <p>VolunteerSpot may amend this policy at any time. If VolunteerSpot  is going to use personally identifiable information collected through VolunteerSpot's  corporate site in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of  collection VolunteerSpot will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice  on VolunteerSpot's Web site for 30 days prior to such use. This Agreement may  not be otherwise amended except in a writing that specifically refers to this Privacy  Policy and is physically signed by both parties. </p>
