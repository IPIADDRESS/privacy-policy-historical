<p></p><h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<h2>VolunteerMatch - Privacy Policy</h2> 

<p><b>Our Commitment To Privacy</b>

</p><p>Your privacy is important to us. Our ongoing commitment to the protection of
your privacy is essential to maintaining the relationship of trust that exists
between VolunteerMatch and all of our users, whether they be nonprofit
organizations, volunteers, readers of our newsletters or other visitors to the
site. This notice of our privacy policy is intended to help you understand our
online information security practices. 

</p><p><b>The Information We Collect</b>

</p><p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the
VolunteerMatch website by any volunteer, nonprofit organization, newsletter
subscriber, or other user of the VolunteerMatch website. The types of personal
information collected on our site are: 

</p><p><b>Newsletter Subscribers:</b>

</p><p>First and Last Name<br>
Email address<br>
Zip Code<br>

</p><p><b>Volunteers:</b>

</p><p>First and Last Name<br>
Email address<br>
Phone number<br>
Zip code<br>

</p><p><b>Nonprofit Organizations:</b>

</p><p><i>Administrator Information</i>: First and last name, email, telephone number, zip
code. 

</p><p><i>Organization Information</i>: Title of organization, address, contact
information (including phone, address and email), EIN/tax identification
number, mission statement, description of services. Website address, logo, URL
and directions to physical location optional. 

</p><p><i>Opportunity Information</i>: Name and title of opportunity, date, time,
one-time/ongoing (type), description of opportunity. Directions and required

</p><p><b>How We Use Information</b>

</p><p>We use the information we collect about you to facilitate the volunteering
process and to provide information to you about VolunteerMatch and related
industry topics. Please be aware that, to the extent required to provide our
services, we share your information with volunteers or nonprofit organization
partners, as applicable. If you indicate on our site that you are interested in
a particular volunteer opportunity and provide us with your contact
information, we will forward your contact information to the organization that
is hosting that opportunity so that the organization can contact you regarding
your potential involvement. 

</p><p>Nonprofits who receive email addresses from potential volunteer signups are
strongly encouraged to adopt privacy standards similar to those of
VolunteerMatch. Each such organization has its own policies regarding
collection and use of personal information and we are not responsible for their
use of your personal information. Inappropriate use of personal information
received from VolunteerMatch may jeopardize nonprofit membership with
VolunteerMatch. VolunteerMatch reserves the right to determine, in its
discretion, what constitutes inappropriate use of this information. For more
about a nonprofit organization's policy, please contact them directly using the
contact information posted for that organization on our site. 

</p><p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. We may use our
e-mail lists for sending out our newsletter and other VolunteerMatch outbound
communications. We do not, however, sell, rent or trade our volunteer,
administrator, nonprofit, or general newsletter e-mail addresses to outside
parties. 

</p><p>Cookies are tiny data files that websites commonly write to your hard drive
when you visit them so that they can remember you when you visit. A cookie file
contains information that can identify you anonymously. Our site uses cookies
to maintain a user's identity between sessions so that the site can be
personalized based on user preferences or a user's history. 

</p><p>We share aggregate information about our users with certain third parties.
This information shows user activity as a whole rather than on an individual
basis and cannot be used to individually identify you. We use aggregated
information we collect about users to continue to improve our service for you. 

</p><p>This site contains links to other sites. VolunteerMatch is not responsible
for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. 

</p><p>VolunteerMatch may provide volunteering services in partnership with third
parties in order to provide benefits for our members, subscribers, and
visitors. In connection with such services, to the extent that you have
provided any personal information to us using these jointly developed services,
VolunteerMatch may share e-mail addresses or other information with the
applicable partner. Each of our partners has its own policies regarding the
collection and use of personal information and VolunteerMatch is not
responsible for their use of your information. 

</p><p><b>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</b>

</p><p>If you are a nonprofit member, you may access all your personally
identifiable information that we collect and maintain online by simply
inputting your username and password in the "Post" area at
http://www.volunteermatch.org. You may make any changes or correct factual
errors in your administrator, organization and opportunity information 24 hours
a day. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You do not
need to contact us to access your record or to make any changes. If you have
problems changing your organization's information, please contact Client
Relations at respond@impactonline.org. 

</p><p>If you are a volunteer and would like to have your contact information
deleted from the site, you may do so by contacting Client Relations at
respond@impactonline.org. 


</p><p><b>Opting-out of communications</b>

</p><p>Individuals who serve as administrators for their organization by
registering and maintaining their organizations' information and membership,
are the only group required to receive VolunteerMatch communications. All other
communications are optional and allow the nonprofit organization, volunteer,
subscriber or other user to unsubscribe from the newsletter. In every email we
send, we provide instructions regarding how to opt-out of receiving future
mailings. Users may remove their information from our database so as not to
receive our service or future communications by sending an email to Client
Relations at respond@impactonline.org. 


</p><p><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b>

</p><p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information
we collect online. 

</p><p><b>Changes to Policy</b>

</p><p>VolunteerMatch may change this privacy policy from time to time.
VolunteerMatch will notify you of any such changes by posting notice of the
changes on the VolunteerMatch start-up screen. If you object to any such
changes, your sole recourse shall be to cease using the VolunteerMatch website.
Continued use of the VolunteerMatch website following notice of any such
changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be
bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
