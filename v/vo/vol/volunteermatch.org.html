</p><h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<h2>VolunteerMatch - Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><b>Our Commitment To Privacy</b> 
</p><p>Your privacy is important to us. Our ongoing commitment to the protection of 
  your privacy is essential to maintaining the relationship of trust that exists 
  between VolunteerMatch and all of our users, whether they be nonprofit organizations, 
  volunteers, readers of our newsletters or other visitors to the site. This notice 
  of our privacy policy is intended to help you understand our online information 
  security practices. 
</p><p><b>The Information We Collect</b> 
</p><p>You may have accessed VolunteerMatch directly by visiting our Web site, the 
  home page of which is located at www.volunteermatch.org, or through the Web 
  site of one of our partners. This notice applies to all information you submit 
  to VolunteerMatch, whether through the VolunteerMatch Web site or through the 
  Web site of one of our partners. Please note that we cannot be responsible for 
  the information you submit to third parties, including our partners, who may 
  have their own posted policies regarding the collection and use of your information. 
  We urge you to review the policies of our partners through whom you may access 
  our services. 
</p><p>The types of personal information we collect are:

</p><p>First and Last Name<br>
  Email address<br>
  Zip Code
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>For Volunteers:</b> 
</p><p>First and Last Name<br>
  Email address<br>
  Phone number<br>
  Zip code
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>For Nonprofit Organizations:</b> 
</p><p><i>Administrator Information</i>: First and last name, email, telephone number, 
  zip code. 
</p><p><i>Organization Information</i>: Title of organization, address, contact information 
  (including phone, address and email), EIN/tax identification number, mission

  to physical location optional. 
</p><p><i>Opportunity Information</i>: Type, name and title of opportunity, date, 
  time, description of opportunity. Directions and required skills optional. 
</p><p><b>How We Use Information</b> 
</p><p>We use the information we collect about you to facilitate the volunteering 
  process and to provide information to you about VolunteerMatch and related industry 
  topics. Please be aware that, to the extent required to provide our services, 
  we share your information with volunteers or nonprofit organization partners, 
  as applicable. If you indicate on our site that you are interested in a particular 
  volunteer opportunity and provide us with your contact information, we will 
  forward your contact information to the organization that is hosting that opportunity 
  so that the organization can contact you regarding your potential involvement. 
</p><p>Nonprofits who receive email addresses from potential volunteer signups are 
  strongly encouraged to adopt privacy standards similar to those of VolunteerMatch. 
  Each such organization has its own policies regarding collection and use of 
  personal information and we are not responsible for their use of your personal 
  information. Inappropriate use of personal information received from VolunteerMatch 
  may jeopardize nonprofit membership with VolunteerMatch. VolunteerMatch reserves 
  the right to determine, in its discretion, what constitutes inappropriate use 
  of this information. For more about a nonprofit organization's policy, please 
  contact them directly using the contact information posted for that organization 
  on our site. 
</p><p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. We may use our 
  e-mail lists for sending out our newsletter and other VolunteerMatch outbound 
  communications. We do not, however, sell, rent or trade our volunteer, administrator, 
  nonprofit, or general newsletter e-mail addresses to outside parties.
</p><p> Cookies are tiny data files that Web sites commonly write to your hard drive 
  when you visit them so that they can remember you when you visit. A cookie file 
  contains information that can identify you anonymously. Our site uses cookies 
  to maintain a user's identity between sessions so that the site can be personalized 
  based on user preferences or a user's history. 
</p><p>We share aggregate information about our users with certain third parties. 
  This information shows user activity as a whole rather than on an individual 
  basis and cannot be used to individually identify you. We use aggregated information 
  we collect about users to continue to improve our service for you. 
</p><p>This site contains links to other sites. VolunteerMatch is not responsible 
  for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 
</p><p>VolunteerMatch may provide volunteering services in partnership with third 
  parties in order to provide benefits for our members, subscribers, and visitors. 
  In connection with such services, to the extent that you have provided any personal 
  information to us using these jointly developed services, VolunteerMatch may 
  share e-mail addresses or other information with the applicable partner. Each 
  of our partners has its own policies regarding the collection and use of personal 
  information and VolunteerMatch is not responsible for their use of your information.
</p><p> In the unlikely event that Impact Online, Incorporated, the organization that 
  operates VolunteerMatch, undergoes a sale or transfer of all or substantially 
  all of its assets, the acquiring entity will be subject to this Privacy Policy 
  in its use of your personally identifiable information. In addition, in the 
  further unlikely event that Impact Online, Incorporated is adjudicated bankrupt 
  or insolvent (a) there will be no further use or disclosure of your personally 
  identifiable information by Impact Online, Incorporated and (b) your personally 
  identifiable information will be destroyed. In addition, there will be no use 
  or disclosure of your personally identifiable information by any entity that 
  acquires assets of Impact Online, Incorporated pursuant to such bankruptcy or 
  insolvency proceedings.

  information that we collect and maintain online by simply inputting your username 
  and password in the "Post" area at <a href="http://www.volunteermatch.org">http://www.volunteermatch.org</a>. 
  You may make any changes or correct factual errors in your administrator, organization 
  and opportunity information 24 hours a day. We use this procedure to better 
  safeguard your information. You do not need to contact us to access your record 
  or to make any changes. If you have problems changing your organization's information, 
  please contact Client Relations at <a href="mailto:respond@volunteermatch.org">respond@volunteermatch.org</a>. 
</p><p>If you are a volunteer and would like to have your contact information deleted

</p><p><b>Opting-out of communications</b> 
</p><p>Individuals who serve as administrators for their organization by registering 
  and maintaining their organizations' information and membership, are the only 
  group required to receive VolunteerMatch communications. All other communications 
  are optional and allow the nonprofit organization, volunteer, subscriber or 
  other user to unsubscribe from the newsletter. In every email we send, we provide 
  instructions regarding how to opt-out of receiving future mailings. Users may 
  remove their information from our database so as not to receive our service 
  or future communications by sending an email to Client Relations at <a href="mailto:respond@volunteermatch.org">respond@volunteermatch.org</a>. 
</p><p><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b> 
</p><p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct 
  use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and 
  managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 
</p><p><b>Changes to Policy</b>

  and conditions of such changes.

  practices of this site, or your dealings with VolunteerMatch. Please send email
