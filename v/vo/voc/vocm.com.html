This privacy policy applies to the use of all newcap radio websites <br>
<br>
We highly value your privacy and make this policy easily available throughout our site to assist you in understanding the handling of information in the course of using this site. <br>
<br>
<strong>Log Files and Cookies</strong> <br>
<br>
This websites utilizes industry standard analytics packages which gathers limited information on visitors to our websites automatically, and stores this anonymous information in server log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, basic IP information, referring pages, operating system used and date/time stamps. This information does not identify individual users; it is used only for site administration, as well as for analysis of websites usage and trends. <br>
<br>
Additionally, cookies may be used to provide easier and faster access to website features such as logins and/or repeat visits. Cookies are very small text files that are stored on personal computers for reference purposes. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you have submitted while on our site. <br>
<br>
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when your browser is closed, and a persistent cookie may stay on your hard drive for an extended period. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our site; persistent cookies can perform such activities as storing your password for forums or blogs so you do not have to sign in every time you visit those areas, and/or may be used to enable us to track and target the interests of our users so as to enhance the overall experience of using our site. <br>
<br>
Most browser softwares allow you to delete cookies. You should consult your Internet service provider for information on how to delete cookies. This may interfere with our ability to personalize your experience at our websites and be recognized, or may slow down performance. <br>
<br>
We have no access to or administration abilities over any cookies that are used by any advertisers on our site. <br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information</strong> <br>
<br>
“Personal Information” in this policy is defined as information that could reasonably personally identify you as an individual. Examples would include your name, mailing and e-mail addresses, age, birthday, telephone number, picture and voice recording. This policy describes the types of Personal Information that we collect, how we collect it, why we collect it and what we use it for. <br>
<br>
“Non-identifiable Personal Information” is information that cannot be associated with, or traced back to, a specific person. Anonymous aggregated information, information about your visits to our websites which is not linked to you, information about your computer’s operating system and web browser software would be considered as Non-identifiable Personal Information. Your computer and its operating systems, browsers, and memory contain vast quantities of transaction data and records of your use of it. This Personal Information could be gleaned from these systems by outsiders if you do not take steps to protect your system. It is our policy not to associate this information with customers, even though we verify some kinds of technical information to ensure that our websites are optimized to serve our customers. <br>
<br>
<strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong> <br>
<br>
Registration is not required in order to use or access this websites. We may collect Personal Information when you enter a contest or other promotional activities through our websites, when you participate in interactive online activities and/or when you contact us to make requests or comment on our services. You may be required to register for these features, particularly if you wish to enter a contest or promotional activity or leave comments or provide articles. <br>
<br>
If you register, and in the process provide us with Personal Information, rest assured that any such information you provide will not be shared with any third-party organization except with your express consent. <br>
<br>
Particular care is employed when we collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. Personal Information from children is not required to obtain access to, surf or view the content of our websites. However, for a child to participate in our contests or promotions, certain Personal Information may be required. Under this scenario, we may collect the first and last name (or user name) of the child, the child’s e-mail address, home address, birth date and gender, as well as the name, home address, e-mail address and telephone number of the child’s parent or guardian. <br>
<br>
Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 is only collected when it is necessary for the purposes of verifying the child’s age, administering the child’s participation in the contest or promotion and, if the child wins a prize, contacting the child’s parent or guardian. We will not use, maintain or disclose this Personal Information for any other purpose. <br>
<br>
The parent or guardian of any child can contact us at any time to get more information about our Personal Information practices or to remove the child’s Personal Information from our records. <br>
<br>
We also provide visitors to our websites the opportunity to opt-in to receive communications from us. In this case, we may ask the visitor for his or her email address, first name and last name, or username, address, city, province, phone number, postal code and birth date. These communications will include our regular newsletter, product promotions and any other information that we feel may be pertinent to the visitor. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications by emailing us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@newcap.ca ">webmaster@newcap.ca </a>, by replying to any email we send you and entering the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line, or by visiting one of our websites and logging into your account and choosing unsubscribe. <br>
<br>
Again, if you provide us with your email address and/or name for the purposes of receiving communications from us, this information will not be shared with any third-party organization except with your express consent. <br>
<br>
<strong>Access to Personal Information</strong> <br>
<br>
If your Personal Information changes, or if you no longer wish us to possess your information, you may request correction, updating, or deletion of your information by emailing us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@newcap.ca ">webmaster@newcap.ca </a>. You may also complete any corrections, updates or deletion requests by visiting a websites login area; you also may make your request by phone or postal mail at the address/phone number indicated at the end of this privacy policy. <br>
<br>
<strong>Security <br>
</strong><br>
We follow accepted industry standards to protect any Personal Information you have provided to us. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage can ever be 100% secure. Therefore – as is the case with any organization - we are not in a position to guarantee the absolute security of your information. <br>
<br>
You may submit any questions you may have about our security procedures by emailing us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@newcap.ca ">webmaster@newcap.ca </a>. <br>
<br>
<strong>Links to Other Websites</strong> <br>
<br>
Our websites may contain links to other sites that are not controlled in any way by us. Please be aware of this when you click on any such links; we are not responsible for the privacy practices and/or policies of any website other than our own. Consequently, we strongly suggest that you review the privacy policy of every website you visit, whether or not they are linked to by our own site. <br>
<br>
<strong>Legal Disclaimer <br>
</strong><br>
We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on our websites. <br>
<br>
