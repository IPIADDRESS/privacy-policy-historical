	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>
		<span>This privacy policy explains how Thinkmap, inc.
			("Thinkmap", "We", or "Us") collects
			and uses personal information that you ("you" or
			"your") provide on Vocabulary.com (the "Site").
			This privacy policy was last updated on 1/23/2013.</span>
	</p>
	<h2>Collecting of Personal Information</h2>
	<p>
		<span>In order to take advantage of certain features of the
			site, you must register. When you register for the Site, we require
			that you provide your name, email address, and your date of birth. We
			also may collect information about the school you attend as well as
			other information that might appear on your user profile.</span>
	</p>
	<h3>User Profiles</h3>
	<p>
		<span>Users have a public profile page that is linked from
			their name when it appears on the site. These pages present
			information that you provide such as a nickname or favorite word. The
			profile page may show information about your use of the site such as
			achievements earned, lists created, or your level.</span>
	</p>
	<h3>User Content</h3>
	<p>
		<span>Users of Vocabulary.com can create various types of
			content ("User Content") that may be displayed publically
			on the site. User Content includes information such as vocabulary
			lists, comments, and other types of material that is shared with the
			community. </span>
	</p>
	<h3>Children</h3>
	<p>
		<span>Children under 13 are provided a limited feature set. All
			children who sign up must provide a parent's email address. The
			parent then must agree to provide permission before the child is able
			to use the site. We ask that children chose a username that is not
			their real name. Children are restricted from certain parts of the
			site. For example, children do not have public profiles, and they
			cannot comment on articles or word lists. In addition, we do not
			collect children's email addresses, so all email communication
			from the Site will be sent to the parent's email address.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1 c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>If you are a parent, and you agree to let your child use
			the site, you agree and acknowledge that you permit your child to use
			the Site and all features made available on the Site as fully
			contemplated by us. As a parent, you understand that any personally
			identifiable information that your child provides in connection with
			registration or otherwise may be used by us as provided in this
			Privacy Policy. Except where the context indicates otherwise, the
			remainder of this Privacy Policy (including any discussion of the
			personally identifiable information that we may collect, use or
			disclose) shall apply equally to a child account and an account for
			someone over 13. </span>
	</p>
	<h3>User-Generated Content and Public Activities: </h3>
	<p>
		<span>We offer opportunities for you to engage in public
			activities on the Site, including submitting comments and creating
			word lists. Any information you disclose in your public activities,
			along with your nickname or username and any image or photo, becomes
			public and may be used by us. Your public activities may also be read
			and collected by other users of the public activity areas on the
			Site. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable
			information you choose to submit in these forums. </span>
	</p>
	<h3>Orders</h3>
	<p>
		<span>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request
			certain personally identifiable information from you on our order
			form. You must provide contact information (such as name and email)
			and financial information (such as billing address, credit card
			number, expiration date). We use this information for billing
			purposes. &nbsp;If we have trouble processing an order, we may use
			this information to contact you.</span>
	</p>
	<h2>Communication from the Site</h2>
	<h3>Customer Service</h3>
	<p>
		<span>Based upon the personally identifiable information you
			provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your email
			address and password. &nbsp;We will also communicate with you in
			response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and
			to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email only. </span>
	</p>
	<h3>Service-related	Announcements</h3>
	<p>
		<span>We will send you strictly service-related announcements
			on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. &nbsp;For instance,
			if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might
			send you an email. </span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications,
			which are not promotional in nature. </span>
	</p>
	<h3>Question Emails</h3>
	<p>
		<span>If you have registered for the Site, we may send you a
			periodic email that include</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;a
			personalized vocabulary question, and information about new content
			on the site. You may opt out of these emails. (Please see
			"Choice and Opt-out")</span>
	</p>
	<h3>Other Emails</h3>
	<p>
		<span>You may opt in to receive other emails, such as comment
			notifications or emails when new material comes out on the blog. You
			may opt out of these emails. (Please see "Choice and
			Opt-out")</span>
	</p>
	<h3>Special Offers and Updates</h3>
	<p>
		<span>We will occasionally send you information on products,
			services, special deals, and promotions. You may opt out of these
			emails. &nbsp;(Please see "Choice and Opt-out")</span>
	</p>
	<h2>Choice and Opt Out</h2>
	<p>
		<span>We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’
			of having your personally identifiable information used for certain
			purposes, when we ask for this information. &nbsp;For example, if you
			purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional
			marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our
			order form.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1 c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>If you no longer wish to receive certain communications
			from us, you may opt-out of receiving them by either changing the
			email preferences section of the My Account section, or through
			clicking on the provided link on any communication that we send.</span>

		<span>We may disclose personally identifiable information to
			provide products or services you've requested when we have your
			permission, and we may access, preserve and disclose account
			information and User Content if required to do so by law or in a good
			faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is
			reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce

			to an educator if you join a class owned by that educator. In this
			case, we may provide your name and your performance on particular
			activities on the site, so that the educator can better help you with
			your vocabulary learning. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1 c0">
		<span></span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>If you are an educator and you add a student who is under
			13 to your class, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely

			Protection Act of 1998, including, but not limited to, obtaining
			parental consent concerning collection of students' personal

			notify you of any such change in ownership or control of your
			information.</span>
