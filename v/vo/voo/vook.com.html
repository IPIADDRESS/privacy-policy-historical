        <strong>Effective Date: July 31, 2009</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Protecting the privacy of our users is very important to
      VOOK.com (“VOOK”). When you register with us, the
      information you provide to us is used to provide the services
      you have registered for, to provide the products you have
      purchased, to deliver email notifications to you, and from
      time to time, to validate your identity. Our data collection
      policies allow you to choose how much information you provide
      to us, and to control how we use that information. This
      privacy statement governs the site WWW.VOOK.COM. To find out
      more, please read the following.</p>
      <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this
      statement, you should first contact VOOK Support at 
      <a href="mailto:customersupport@vook.com">
      customersupport@vook.com</a>.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Information Collection &amp; Use</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>We want your experience at VOOK to be satisfying and safe.
      Our data collection policies give you the option to choose
      how much information you provide to us, and what we do with
      the information you supply. Except as set forth below, your
      information will be kept within VOOK unless you consent to
      our supplying all or a portion of your information to third
      parties as a part of one of our service or product offerings.
      However, if you tell us not to send you further emails, this
      instruction may be communicated to third parties who send
      email on our behalf solely to allow us to comply with your
      instructions. VOOK collects information online to allow you
      to use our services. Depending on the service you are
      accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide
      information such as your name, email address, contact phone
      number, credit card number or other information related to
      the service or product you are seeking. We request this
      information to deliver what you are requesting, and as well
      as to allow us to provide you a personalized online
      experience. Information collected online is often defined as
      being either anonymous or personally identifiable:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Anonymous Information refers to information which
        cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example,
        we may know that thousands of people have visited this
        Privacy Policy webpage, but we do not necessarily know
        their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What
        we collect from visits such as these constitutes anonymous
        information. Some of the individuals who access our
        services decline to use the personalization features that
        are available to them, and therefore those individuals are
        anonymous and the only data we collect about them is
        anonymous information.</li>
        <li>Personally Identifiable Information refers to
        information that tells us specifically who you are, such as
        your name, email address, phone number or credit card
        information. While you can search and browse some sections
        of our web site without being a registered user, certain
        activities, such as placing a comment do require
        registration. We collect your name, email address and phone
        number when you register for an account on our site.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Depending on the services or products you have chosen,
      some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information may
      be used by us to provide such services.</p>
      <p>Personally Identifiable Information may also be provided
      to intermediaries and third parties who assist us in
      providing you with the service or product you request,for
      example, our credit card processing. We may also use a third
      party service provider to send you newsletters. These third
      parties are not authorized to use your information for their
      promotional purposes. Also, when you register with us to
      purchase a Vook, we will share certain Personally
      Identifiable Information, such as your name and email
      address, with our publishing partner.</p>
      <p>Registering with VOOK will also cause a cookie to be
      issued; this cookie allows us to "recognize" you when you are
      on our site to allow us to personalize our service for
      you.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Cookies</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a
      user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use
      cookies on this site. We may link the information we store in
      cookies to any Personally Identifiable Information you submit
      while on our site. We set a persistent cookie to store your
      passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than
      once.</p>
      <p>Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the
      interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
      These cookies help us to identify VOOK’s searched as
      well as comments left so that we can further refine searches
      for you. Except as set forth below on how to remove cookies,
      you may not opt out of having your Personally Identifiable
      Information tied to our cookies.</p>
      <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We
      use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our
      site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your
      browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for
      an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to
      store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it
      more than once. Persistent cookies also enable VOOK to track
      and target the interests of our users to enhance the
      experience on our site. You can remove persistent cookies by
      following directions provided in your Internet
      browser’s “help” file.</p>
      <p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but
      your ability to use some areas of our site, such as the
      application remembering your reading state will not be
      possible.</p>
      <p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use
      cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over
      these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of
      cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of
      cookies by any business partners or advertisers on our web
      site. See "Third Party Advertisers."</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>We may employ a software technology called clear gifs
      (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage
      content on our site by informing us what content is
      effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
      identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to
      track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to
      cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard
      drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are
      close to the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
      We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our
      customers’ Personally Identifiable Information. You may
      not opt out of the use of these clear gifs.</p>
      <p>We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us
      know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows
      us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and
      the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Third Party Advertisers</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>The ads appearing on this web site, if any, may be
      delivered to users by third-party advertising companies.
      Third-party advertising companies may use cookies and clear
      GIFs on this site, which allow it to recognize a user's
      cookie when a user visits this site. The companies serve
      their ads from their own web sites, independently from VOOK.
      The information that the third-party advertising companies
      collect and share through this technology is not personally
      identifiable, unless you provide such information in response
      to an advertisement.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Anonymous Information</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain
      information automatically and store it in log files. This
      information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,
      browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
      pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream
      data.</p>
      <p>We use this information, which does not identify
      individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site,
      to track users’ movements around the site and to gather
      demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
      <p>We may link this automatically-collected data to
      Personally Identifiable Information. This data is used for
      statistical analysis purposes and to ensure that the web site
      is working for each particular user.</p>
      <p>VOOK is the sole owner of the information collected on
      WWW.VOOK.COM. We may collect Personally Identifiable
      Information from our users at several different points on our
      Web site.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Special Offers and Updates From Vook and Our
        Publishing Partner</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>We may occasionally send you information on services,
      special deals, products and/or promotions via email
      newsletters. You can opt out of receiving these newsletters
      by accessing your account and updating your “Newsletter
      subscription” preferences or selecting the
      “unsubscribe” function present in the message. If
      you have opted in to receive information on services, special
      deals, products and promotions from our publishing partners,
      then you will need to visit our publishing partner’s
      website to opt out or use the “unsubscribe”
      function present in their message.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Service-related Announcements</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on
      rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance,
      if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance or
      other purposes, we might send you an email.</p>
      <p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications,
      which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to
      receive them, you have the option to deactivate your
      account.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Customer Service</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>Based upon the Personally Identifiable Information you
      provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your
      username and password. We will also communicate with you in
      response to your inquiries, to provide the services you
      request, and to manage your account. We may communicate with
      you by email or telephone, if you have provided such
      information.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Profile</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log
      files, or clear gifs to create a “profile” of
      your preferences. We may tie your Personally Identifiable
      Information to information in the profile, in order to
      provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to
      improve the content of the site for you.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Comment</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>If you post to a blog/forum/discussion group on this site,
      you should be aware that any information you submit there can
      be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums,
      and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are
      not responsible for the Personally Identifiable Information
      you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Email A Friend</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>If you send an email using our Send to a Friend service to
      an email address that has not been registered in our system,
      we do not use that email address for any purpose other than
      to send your email, and for us to send automatically your
      friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the
      site. We store the email address in order to send this
      one-time email and to track the success of our referral
      program. We do not share this information with any third
      parties for their promotional purposes.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Links to Other Sites</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>VOOK contains links to other sites that are not owned or
      controlled by VOOK. Please be aware that we are not
      responsible for the privacy practices of such other
      sites.</p>
      <p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and
      to read the privacy statements of each and every web site
      that collects Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
      <p>This privacy statement applies only to information
      collected by this web site.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Access to Personally Identifiable
        Information</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, or if
      you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update,
      delete or deactivate it by contacting us at 
      <a href="mailto:customersupport@vook.com">
      customersupport@vook.com</a>.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Security</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>We operate secure data networks protected by industry
      standard firewall and password protection systems. Our
      security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and
      enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have
      access to the information provided by our customers. You the
      consumer are ultimately responsible for the security of your
      Member Name and Password. Please take care to store your
      Member Name separately from your account password, or better
      yet, choose a password that you don't need to write down at
      all.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Business Transitions</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>In the event VOOK goes through a business transition, such
      as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all
      or a portion of its assets as well as in the event of a
      bankruptcy, assignment for benefit of creditors or
      receivership, your Personally Identifiable Information may be
      disclosed and will likely be among the assets transferred.
      You will be notified via prominent notice on our web site for
      30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your
      Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to disclose your Personally
      Identifiable Information as required by law and when we
      believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights
      and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or
      legal process served on our web site.</p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>If we decide to make any material changes to our privacy
      policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement
      and other places we deem appropriate on our site so that you
      are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and
      under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at
      any time, so please review it frequently.</p>
