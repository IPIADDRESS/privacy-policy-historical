		<p><strong>Effective Date: July 31, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Protecting the privacy of our users is very important to       VOOK.com (“VOOK”). When you register with us, the       information you provide to us is used to provide the services       you have registered for, to provide the products you have       purchased, to deliver email notifications to you, and from       time to time, to validate your identity. Our data collection       policies allow you to choose how much information you provide       to us, and to control how we use that information. This       privacy statement governs the site WWW.VOOK.COM. To find out       more, please read the following.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this       statement, you should first contact VOOK Support at        <a href="mailto:customersupport@vook.com"> customersupport@vook.com</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Information Collection &amp; Use</strong></h3>
<p>We want your experience at VOOK to be satisfying and safe.       Our data collection policies give you the option to choose       how much information you provide to us, and what we do with       the information you supply. Except as set forth below, your       information will be kept within VOOK unless you consent to       our supplying all or a portion of your information to third       parties as a part of one of our service or product offerings.       However, if you tell us not to send you further emails, this       instruction may be communicated to third parties who send       email on our behalf solely to allow us to comply with your       instructions. VOOK collects information online to allow you       to use our services. Depending on the service you are       accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide       information such as your name, email address, contact phone       number, credit card number or other information related to       the service or product you are seeking. We request this       information to deliver what you are requesting, and as well       as to allow us to provide you a personalized online       experience. Information collected online is often defined as       being either anonymous or personally identifiable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anonymous Information refers to information which         cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example,         we may know that thousands of people have visited this         Privacy Policy webpage, but we do not necessarily know         their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What         we collect from visits such as these constitutes anonymous         information. Some of the individuals who access our         services decline to use the personalization features that         are available to them, and therefore those individuals are         anonymous and the only data we collect about them is         anonymous information.</li>
<li>Personally Identifiable Information refers to         information that tells us specifically who you are, such as         your name, email address, phone number or credit card         information. While you can search and browse some sections         of our web site without being a registered user, certain         activities, such as placing a comment do require         registration. We collect your name, email address and phone         number when you register for an account on our site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the services or products you have chosen,       some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information may       be used by us to provide such services.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information may also be provided       to intermediaries and third parties who assist us in       providing you with the service or product you request,for       example, our credit card processing. We may also use a third       party service provider to send you newsletters. These third       parties are not authorized to use your information for their       promotional purposes. Also, when you register with us to       purchase a Vook, we will share certain Personally       Identifiable Information, such as your name and email       address, with our publishing partner.</p>
<p>Registering with VOOK will also cause a cookie to be       issued; this cookie allows us to "recognize" you when you are       on our site to allow us to personalize our service for       you.</p>
<h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a       user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use       cookies on this site. We may link the information we store in       cookies to any Personally Identifiable Information you submit       while on our site. We set a persistent cookie to store your       passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than       once.</p>
<p>Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the       interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.       These cookies help us to identify VOOK’s searched as       well as comments left so that we can further refine searches       for you. Except as set forth below on how to remove cookies,       you may not opt out of having your Personally Identifiable       Information tied to our cookies.</p>
<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We       use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our       site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your       browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for       an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to       store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it       more than once. Persistent cookies also enable VOOK to track       and target the interests of our users to enhance the       experience on our site. You can remove persistent cookies by       following directions provided in your Internet       browser’s “help” file.</p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but       your ability to use some areas of our site, such as the       application remembering your reading state will not be       possible.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use       cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over       these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of       cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of       cookies by any business partners or advertisers on our web       site. See "Third Party Advertisers."</p>
<h3><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></h3>
<p>We may employ a software technology called clear gifs       (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage       content on our site by informing us what content is       effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique       identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to       track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to       cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard       drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are       close to the size of the period at the end of this sentence.       We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our       customers’ Personally Identifiable Information. You may       not opt out of the use of these clear gifs.</p>
<p>We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us       know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows       us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and       the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<h3><strong>Third Party Advertisers</strong></h3>
<p>The ads appearing on this web site, if any, may be       delivered to users by third-party advertising companies.       Third-party advertising companies may use cookies and clear       GIFs on this site, which allow it to recognize a user's       cookie when a user visits this site. The companies serve       their ads from their own web sites, independently from VOOK.       The information that the third-party advertising companies       collect and share through this technology is not personally       identifiable, unless you provide such information in response       to an advertisement.</p>
<h3><strong>Anonymous Information</strong></h3>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain       information automatically and store it in log files. This       information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,       browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit       pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream       data.</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify       individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site,       to track users’ movements around the site and to gather       demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>We may link this automatically-collected data to       Personally Identifiable Information. This data is used for       statistical analysis purposes and to ensure that the web site       is working for each particular user.</p>
<p>VOOK is the sole owner of the information collected on       WWW.VOOK.COM. We may collect Personally Identifiable       Information from our users at several different points on our       Web site.</p>
<h3><strong>Special Offers and Updates From Vook and Our         Publishing Partner</strong></h3>
<p>We may occasionally send you information on services,       special deals, products and/or promotions via email       newsletters. You can opt out of receiving these newsletters       by accessing your account and updating your “Newsletter       subscription” preferences or selecting the       “unsubscribe” function present in the message. If       you have opted in to receive information on services, special       deals, products and promotions from our publishing partners,       then you will need to visit our publishing partner’s       website to opt out or use the “unsubscribe”       function present in their message.</p>
<h3><strong>Service-related Announcements</strong></h3>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on       rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance,       if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance or       other purposes, we might send you an email.</p>
<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications,       which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to       receive them, you have the option to deactivate your       account.</p>
<h3><strong>Customer Service</strong></h3>
<p>Based upon the Personally Identifiable Information you       provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your       username and password. We will also communicate with you in       response to your inquiries, to provide the services you       request, and to manage your account. We may communicate with       you by email or telephone, if you have provided such       information.</p>
<h3><strong>Profile</strong></h3>
<p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log       files, or clear gifs to create a “profile” of       your preferences. We may tie your Personally Identifiable       Information to information in the profile, in order to       provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to       improve the content of the site for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Comment</strong></h3>
<p>If you post to a blog/forum/discussion group on this site,       you should be aware that any information you submit there can       be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums,       and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are       not responsible for the Personally Identifiable Information       you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
<h3><strong>Email A Friend</strong></h3>
<p>If you send an email using our Send to a Friend service to       an email address that has not been registered in our system,       we do not use that email address for any purpose other than       to send your email, and for us to send automatically your       friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the       site. We store the email address in order to send this       one-time email and to track the success of our referral       program. We do not share this information with any third       parties for their promotional purposes.</p>
<h3><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></h3>
<p>VOOK contains links to other sites that are not owned or       controlled by VOOK. Please be aware that we are not       responsible for the privacy practices of such other       sites.</p>
<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and       to read the privacy statements of each and every web site       that collects Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>This privacy statement applies only to information       collected by this web site.</p>
<h3><strong>Access to Personally Identifiable         Information</strong></h3>
<p>If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, or if       you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update,       delete or deactivate it by contacting us at        <a href="mailto:customersupport@vook.com"> customersupport@vook.com</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
<p>We operate secure data networks protected by industry       standard firewall and password protection systems. Our       security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and       enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have       access to the information provided by our customers. You the       consumer are ultimately responsible for the security of your       Member Name and Password. Please take care to store your       Member Name separately from your account password, or better       yet, choose a password that you don't need to write down at       all.</p>
<h3><strong>Business Transitions</strong></h3>
<p>In the event VOOK goes through a business transition, such       as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all       or a portion of its assets as well as in the event of a       bankruptcy, assignment for benefit of creditors or       receivership, your Personally Identifiable Information may be       disclosed and will likely be among the assets transferred.       You will be notified via prominent notice on our web site for       30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your       Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<h3><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></h3>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Personally       Identifiable Information as required by law and when we       believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights       and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or       legal process served on our web site.</p>
<h3><strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong></h3>
<p>If we decide to make any material changes to our privacy       policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement       and other places we deem appropriate on our site so that you       are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and       under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at       any time, so please review it frequently.</p>
