  <font face="Lucida Grande">Vookster Pages are public pages. Companies use

  about their latest projects. And communities use pages to discuss topics of 
  interest, everything from baseball to the opera.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Because Pages are public, information you share 
  with a Page is public information. This means, for example, that if you post a

  and anyone can see it. </font>
</div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">When you "like" a Page, you create a connection to 
  that Page. That connection is added to your profile and your friends may see 
  it in their News Feeds. You may also receive updates from the Page in your 
  News Feed and your messages. You can remove the Pages you've "liked" from your 
  profile.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Some Pages contain content that comes directly from 
  the Page owner. Page owners can do this through online plugins, such as an 
  iframe, and it works just like the games and other applications you use 
  through Vookster. Because this content comes directly from the Page owner, 
  that Page may be able to collect information about you, just like any website.</font></div>

  websites you and your friends use. Vookster Platform also lets you bring your 
  friends with you, so you can connect with them off of Vookster. In these two 
  ways, Vookster Platform helps you make your experiences on the web more 
  personalized and social.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Remember that these games, applications and 
  websites are created and maintained by other businesses and developers who are 
  not part of Vookster, so you should always make sure to read their terms of 
  service and privacy policies.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Controlling what information you share with 
  applications</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">When you go to a game or application, or connect 
  with a website using Vookster Platform, we give the game, application, or 
  website (sometimes referred to as just "Applications" or "Apps") your User ID, 
  as well your friends' User IDs (or your friend list).</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Your friend list helps the application make your 
  experience more social because it lets you find your friends on that 
  application. Your User ID helps the application personalize your experience 
  because it can connect your account on that application with your Vookster 
  account, and it can access your public information. This includes the 
  information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always 
  publicly available. If the application needs additional information, it will 
  have to ask you for specific permission.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">The âApps you useâ setting lets you control the 
  applications you use. You can see the permissions you have given these 
  applications, as well as the last time an application accessed your 
  information. You can also remove applications you no longer want, or turn off 
  all Platform applications. When you turn all Platform applications off, your 
  User ID is no longer given to applications, even when your friends use those 
  applications. But you will no longer be able to use any games, applications or 
  websites through Vookster.</font></div>

Applications also get your age range, locale, and gender when you and your 
friends visit them. Age range (e.g., 18-21) lets applications provide you with 
age-appropriate content. Locale (e.g., en-US) lets applications know what 
language you speak. Gender lets applications refer to you correctly. If you do 
not want applications to receive this information about you, you can turn off 
all Vookster applications using your Privacy Settings.<br>
<img class="img" src="https://fbcdn_dragon-a.akamaihd.net/cfs-ak-snc6/84980/923/233641236679183_1009183043.png" alt="" width="9" height="17"> 
Sometimes a game console, mobile phone, or other device might ask for permission 
to share specific information with the games and applications you use on that 
device (such as your public information). If you say okay, those applications 
will not be able to access any other information about you without asking 
specific permission from you or your friends.<br>

  <font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Controlling what is shared when the people 
  you share with use applications</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Just like when you share information by email or 
  elsewhere on the web, information you share on Vookster can be re-shared. This 
  means that if you share something on Vookster, anyone who can see it can share 
  it with others, including the games, applications, and websites they use.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Your friends and the other people you share 
  information with often want to share your information with applications to 
  make their experiences on those application more personalized and social. For 
  example, one of your friends might want to use a music application that allows 
  them to see what their friends are listening to. To get the full benefit of 
  that application, your friend would want to give the application her friend 
  list â which includes your User ID â so the application knows which of her 
  friends is also using it. Your friend might also want to share the music you 
  âlikeâ on Vookster. If you have made that information public, then the 
  application can access it just like anyone else. But if youâve shared your 
  likes with just your friends, the application could ask your friend for 
  permission to share them.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">You can control most of the information other 
  people can share with applications from the âApps and Websitesâ settings page. 
  But these controls do not let you limit access to your public information and 
  friend list.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">If you want to completely block applications from 
  getting your information, you will need to turn off all Platform applications. 
  This means that you will no longer be able to use any games, applications or 
  websites.</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
<img class="img" src="https://fbcdn_dragon-a.akamaihd.net/cfs-ak-snc6/84980/923/233641236679183_1009183043.png" alt="" width="9" height="17"> 
If an application asks permission from someone else to access your information, 
the application will be allowed to use that information only in connection with 
the person that gave the permission and no one else.<br>

<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Logging in to another site using Vookster</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Vookster Platform also lets you log into other 
  applications and websites using your Vookster account. When you log in using 
  Vookster, we give the site your User ID, but we do not share your email 
  address or password with that website.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">If you already have an account on that website, the 
  site may also be able to connect that account with your Vookster account. 
  Sometimes it does this using what is called an "email hash", which is similar 
  to searching for someone on Vookster using an email address. Only the email 
  addresses in this case are encrypted so no email addresses are actually shared 
  between Vookster and the website.</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>How it works</b><br>
The website sends over an encrypted version of your email address, and we match 
it with a database of email addresses that we have also encrypted. If there is a 
match, then we tell the website the User ID associated with the email address. 
This way, when you log into the website using Vookster, the website can link 
your Vookster account to your account on that website.<br>

  <font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>About social plugins</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Social plugins are buttons, boxes, and stories 
  (such as the Like button) that other websites can use to present Vookster 
  content to you and create more social and personal experiences for you. While 
  you view these buttons, boxes, and stories on other sites, the content comes 
  directly from Vookster.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">If you make something public using a plugin, such 
  as posting a public comment on a newspaper's website, then that website can 
  access your comment (along with your User ID) just like everyone else. </font>

Websites that use social plugins can sometimes tell that you have engaged with 
the social plugin. For example, they may know that you clicked on a Like button 
in a social plugin.<br>
<img class="img" src="https://fbcdn_dragon-a.akamaihd.net/cfs-ak-snc6/84980/923/233641236679183_1009183043.png" alt="" width="9" height="17"> 
We receive data when you visit a site with a social plugin. We keep this data 
for 90 days. After that, we remove your name or any other personally identifying 
information from the data, or combine it with other people's data in a way that 
it is no longer associated with you.<br>

<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>About instant personalization</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Instant personalization is a way for Vookster to 
  help partner sites (such as Bing and Rotten Tomatoes) create a more 
  personalized and social experience than a social plugin can offer. When you 
  visit a site using instant personalization, it will know some information 
  about you and your friends the moment you arrive. This is because instant 
  personalization sites can access your User ID, your friend list, and your 
  public information.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">The first time you visit an instant personalization 
  site, you will see a notification letting you know that the site has partnered 
  with Vookster to provide a personalized experience.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">The notification will give you the ability to 
  disable or turn off instant personalization for that site. If you do that, 
  that site is required to delete all of the information about you it received 
  from Vookster. In addition, we will prevent that site from accessing your 
  information in the future, even when your friends use that site.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">If you decide that you do not want to experience 
  instant personalization for all partner sites, you can disable instant 
  personalization from the âApps and Websitesâ settings page. </font>
</div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">If you turn off instant personalization, partner 
  sites will not be able to access your public information, even when your 
  friends visit those sites.</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
<img class="img" src="https://fbcdn_dragon-a.akamaihd.net/cfs-ak-snc6/84980/923/233641236679183_1009183043.png" alt="" width="9" height="17"> 
If you turn off an instant personalization site after you have been using it or 
visited it a few times (or after you have given it specific permission to access 
your data), it will not automatically delete your data. But the site is 
contractually required to delete your data if you ask it to.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
&nbsp;</div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>How it works</b><br>
To join the instant personalization program, a potential partner must enter into 
an agreement with us designed to protect your privacy. For example, this 
agreement requires that the partner delete your data if you turn off instant 
personalization when you first visit the site. It also prevents the partner from 
accessing any information about you until you or your friends visit its site.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Instant personalization partners sometimes use an 
  email hash process to see if any of their users are on Vookster and get those 
  users' User IDs. This process is similar to searching for someone on Vookster 
  using an email address, except in this case the email addresses are encrypted 
  so no actual email addresses are exchanged. The partner is also contractually 
  required not to use your User ID for any purpose (other than associating it 
  with your account) until you or your friends visit the site.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">When you visit an instant personalization site, we 
  provide the site with your User ID and your friend list (as well as your age 
  range, locale, and gender). The site can then connect your account on that 
  site with your friends' accounts to make the site instantly social. The site 
  can also access public information associated with any of the User IDs it 
  receives, which it can use to make the site instantly personalized. For 
  example, if the site is a music site, it can access your music interests to 
  suggest songs you may like, and access your friends' music interests to let 
  you know what they are listening to. Of course it can only access you or your 
  friendsâ music interests if they are public. If the site wants any additional 
  information, it will have to get your specific permission.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Public search engines</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Your Public Search setting controls whether people 
  who enter your name on a public search engine may see your public profile 
  (including in sponsored results). You can find your Public Search setting on 
  the âApps and Websitesâ settings page. You can preview your public profile at:

If you turn your public search setting off and then search for yourself on a 
public search engine, you may still see a preview of your profile. This is 
because some search engines cache information for a period of time. You can

  <font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>IV. How Advertising Works</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Personalized ads</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">We do not share any of your information with 
  advertisers (unless, of course, you give us permission).</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">When an advertiser creates an ad on Vookster, they 
  are given the opportunity to choose their audience by location, demographics, 
  likes, keywords, and any other information we receive or can tell about you 
  and other users. For example, an advertiser can choose to target 18 to 35 
  year-old women who live in the United States and like basketball. </font>
</div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Try this tool yourself to see one of the ways 
  advertisers target ads and what information they see at: 
  https://www.vookster.com/ads/create/</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">If the advertiser chooses to run the ad (also known 
  as placing the order), we serve the ad to people who meet the criteria the 
  advertiser selected, but we do not tell the advertiser who any of those people 
  are. So, for example, if a person clicks on the ad, the advertiser might infer 
  that the person is an 18-to-35-year-old woman who lives in the US and likes 
  basketball. But we would not tell the advertiser who that person is.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">After the ad runs, we provide advertisers with 
  reports on how their ads performed. For example we give advertisers reports 
  telling them how many users saw or clicked on their ads. But these reports are 
  anonymous. We do not tell advertisers who saw or clicked on their ads.</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
<img class="img" src="https://fbcdn_dragon-a.akamaihd.net/cfs-ak-snc6/84980/923/233641236679183_1009183043.png" alt="" width="9" height="17"> 
Advertisers sometimes place cookies on your computer in order to make their ads 
more effective. Learn more at: 
http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp<br>
<img class="img" src="https://fbcdn_dragon-a.akamaihd.net/cfs-ak-snc6/84980/923/233641236679183_1009183043.png" alt="" width="9" height="17"> 
Sometimes we allow advertisers to target a category of user, like a "moviegoer" 
or a "sci-fi fan." We do this by bundling characteristics that we believe are 
related to the category. For example, if a person "likes" the "Star Trek" Page 
and mentions "Star Wars" when they check into a movie theater, we may conclude 
that this person is likely to be a sci-fi fan.<br>

<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Ads + social context</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Vookster Ads are sometimes paired with social 
  actions your friends have taken. For example, an ad for a sushi restaurant may 
  be paired with a news story that one of your friends likes that restaurant's 
  Vookster page.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">This is the same type of news story that could show 
  up in your News Feed, only we place it next to a paid advertisement to make 
  that ad more relevant and interesting.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">When you show up in one of these news stories, we 
  will only pair it with ads shown to your friends. If you do not want to appear

We may serve ads with social context (or serve just social context) on other 
sites. These work just like the ads we serve on Vookster - the advertisers do 
not receive any of your information.<br>

We sometimes allow businesses or anyone else to sponsor stories like the ones 
that show up in your News Feed, subject to the audience set for that story. 
While these are sponsored, they are different from ads because they don't 
contain a message from the person that sponsored them. Your friends will see 
these stories even if you have opted out of the "Show my social actions in 
Vookster Ads" setting <br>
<img class="img" src="https://fbcdn_dragon-a.akamaihd.net/cfs-ak-snc6/84980/923/233641236679183_1009183043.png" alt="" width="9" height="17">

<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
  <font face="Lucida Grande">Many of the things you do on Vookster (like 
  "liking" a Page) are posted to your Wall and shared in News Feed. But there's 
  a lot to read in News Feed. That's why we allow people to "sponsor" your 
  stories to make sure your friends see them. For example, if you RSVP to an 
  event hosted by a local restaurant, that restaurant may want to make sure your 
  friends see it so they can come too. If they do sponsor a story, that story 
  will appear in the same place ads usually do under the heading "Sponsored 
  Stories" or something similar. Only people that could originally see the story 
  can see the sponsored story, and no personal information about you (or your 
  friends) is shared with the sponsor.</font></div>

  friends use on Vookster to help you have a better experience. For example, if 
  your friend uses our friend finder tool to find more friends on Vookster, we

protect you (and Vookster). For example, we may use them to know you are logged 
in to Vookster, to help you use social plugins and share buttons, or to know 
when you are interacting with our advertising or Platform partners. We may also 
ask advertisers to serve ads to computers, mobile phones or other devices with a 
cookie placed by Vookster (although we would not share any other information 
with that advertiser). Most companies on the web use cookies (or similar 
technological methods), including our advertising and Platform partners. You can 
always remove or block cookies (such as by using the settings in your browser), 
but it may affect your ability to use Vookster. Learn more at:
