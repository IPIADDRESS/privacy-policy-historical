<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Information we receive about you</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">We receive a number of different types of
information about you, including:</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Your information</b><br>
Your information is the information that's required when you sign up for the
site, as well as the information you choose to share. </font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">

such as when you post a status update, upload a photo, or comment on a
friend's post.</font></div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">It also includes the information you choose to
share when you take an action, such as when you add a friend, like a Page or a
website, tag a place in your post, find friends using our contact importers,
or indicate you are in a relationship.<br>
</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
Your name, profile picture, networks, username and User ID are treated just like
information you choose to make public. <br>
Your birthday allows us to do things like show you age-appropriate content and
advertisements. </font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Information others share about you</b><br>
We receive information about you from your friends, such as when they tag you in
a photo or at a location, or add you to a group. </font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">We may also receive information about you from the
games, applications, and websites you use, but only when you have given them
permission. If you have given a game, application, or website permission to
post information on your Wall, you can remove it from your “Apps you use”
setting. </font>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Other information we receive about you</b><br>
We also receive other types of information about you: </font></p>
<ul class="uiList uiListBulleted">
<li class="uiListVerticalItemBorder">
<div class="fcb">
<font face="Lucida Grande">We receive data about you whenever you interact
with Vookster, such as when you look at another person's profile, send
someone a message, search for a friend or a Page, click on an ad, or
purchase Vookster Credits.</font></div>
</li>
<li class="uiListVerticalItemBorder">
<div class="fcb">
<font face="Lucida Grande">When you post things like photos or videos on
Vookster, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the
time, date, and place you took the photo or video.</font></div>
</li>
<li class="uiListVerticalItemBorder">
<div class="fcb">
<font face="Lucida Grande">We receive data from the computer, mobile phone
or other device you use to access Vookster. This may include your IP
address, location, the type of browser you use, or the pages you visit. For
example, we may get your GPS location so we can tell you if any of your
friends are nearby.</font></div>
</li>
<li class="uiListVerticalItemBorder">
<div class="fcb">
<font face="Lucida Grande">We receive data whenever you visit a game,
application, or website that uses Vookster Platform or visit a site with a
Vookster feature (such as a social plugin). This may include the date and
time you visit the site; the web address, or URL, you're on; technical
information about the IP address, browser and the operating system you use;
and, if you are logged in to Vookster, your User ID.</font></div>
</li>
<li class="uiListVerticalItemBorder">
<div class="fcb">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Sometimes we get data from our advertising
partners, customers and other third parties that helps us (or them) deliver
ads, understand online activity, and generally make Vookster better. For
example, an advertiser may tell us how you responded to an ad on Vookster or
on another site in order to measure the effectiveness of - and improve the
quality of - those ads.</font></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">We also put together data from the information we
already have about you and your friends. For example, we may put together data
about you to determine which friends we should show you in your News Feed or
suggest you tag in the photos you post. We may put together your current city
with GPS and other location information we have about you to, for example,
tell you and your friends about people or events nearby, or offer deals to you
that you might be interested in. We may also put together data about you to
serve you ads that might be more relevant to you.</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location
information we have about you (like your current city). But we only keep it
until it is no longer useful to provide you services.<br>
We only provide data to our advertising partners or customers after we have
removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or
have combined it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer
associated with you. Similarly, when we receive data about you from our
advertising partners or customers, we keep the data for 180 days. After that, we
combine the data with other people's data in a way that it is no longer
associated with you.<br>

<div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="width: 822; height: 21">
<p>
<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Public information</u></b></font></p></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">When we use the phrase "public information" (which
we sometimes refer to as "Everyone information"), we mean the information you
choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly
available.</font></div>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Information you choose to make public</b><br>
Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: <b>
anyone</b>, including people off of Vookster, will be able to see it.<br>
</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
</div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">Choosing to make your information public also
means that this information: </font></p>
<ul class="uiList uiListBulleted">
<li class="uiListVerticalItemBorder">
<div class="fcb">
<font face="Lucida Grande">can be associated with you (i.e., your name,
profile picture, Vookster profile, User ID, etc.) even off Vookster</font></div>
</li>
<li class="uiListVerticalItemBorder">
<div class="fcb">
<font face="Lucida Grande">can show up when someone does a search on
Vookster or on a public search engine</font></div>
</li>
<li class="uiListVerticalItemBorder">
<div class="fcb">
<font face="Lucida Grande">will be accessible to the games, applications,
and websites you and your friends use</font></div>
</li>
<li class="uiListVerticalItemBorder">
<div class="fcb">
<font face="Lucida Grande">will be accessible to anyone who uses our APIs
such as our Graph API. </font>

<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
</div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something
(like when you write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our
comments plugin). This is because some types of posts are always public posts.
As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the
information will be publicly available.<br>
When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.

<font face="Lucida Grande">If you tag someone, that person and their friends
can see your post no matter what audience you selected. The same is true when
you approve a tag someone else adds to your post.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Always think before you post. Just like anything
else you post on the web or send in an email, information you share on
Vookster can be copied or re-shared by anyone who can see it. </font>

When you comment on or "like" someone else's post, or write on their Wall, that
person gets to select the audience.<br>
You can control who can see the Vookster Pages you've "liked" by visiting your
profile and clicking "Edit Profile."<br>
Sometimes you will not see a sharing icon when you post something (like when you
write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments
plugin). This is because some types of posts are always public posts. As a
general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the

<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">When you select an audience for your friend list,
you are only controlling who can see it on your profile. We call this a
profile visibility control. This is because your friend list is always
available to the games, applications and websites you use, and your
friendships may be visible elsewhere (such as on your friends' profiles or in
searches). For example, if you select "Only Me" as the audience for your
friend list, but your friend sets her friend list to "Public," anyone will be
able to see your connection on your friend's profile.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Similarly, if you choose to hide your gender, it
only hides it on your profile. This is because we, just like the applications
you and your friends use, need to use your gender to refer to you properly on
the site.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">When someone tags you in a post (such as a photo,
status update or check-in), you can choose whether you want that post to
appear on your profile. You can either approve each post individually or
approve all posts by your friends. If you approve a post and later change your
mind, you can remove it from your profile. </font>
</div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
To make it easier for your friends to find you, we allow anyone with your
contact information (such as your email address or mobile number), to find you
through Vookster search, as well as other tools we provide, such as contact
importers.<br>
If you share your contact information (such as your email address or mobile
number) with your friends, they may be able to use third party applications to
sync that information with other address books, including ones on their mobile
phones.<br>
Some things (like your name and profile picture) do not have sharing icons

<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>What your friends share about you</u></b></font></p></div>

A tag is a link to your profile. For example, if you are tagged in a post (such

If someone clicks on the link, they will see your public information and
anything else you let them see.<br>
</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Anyone can tag you in anything. Once you are tagged
in a post, you and your friends will be able to see it. For example, your
friends may be able to see the post in their News Feed or when they search for
you. It may also appear on your profile.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">You can choose whether a post you've been tagged in

that does not work, you can block them. This will prevent them from tagging

If you are tagged in a private space (such as a message or a group) only the
people who can see the private space can see the tag. Similarly, it you are

<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>About Pages</u></b></font></p></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Vookster Pages are public pages. Companies use
Pages to share information about their products. Celebrities use Pages to talk
about their latest projects. And communities use pages to discuss topics of
interest, everything from baseball to the opera.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Because Pages are public, information you share
with a Page is public information. This means, for example, that if you post a
comment on a Page, that comment can be used by the Page owner off of Vookster,
and anyone can see it. </font>
</div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">When you "like" a Page, you create a connection to
that Page. That connection is added to your profile and your friends may see
it in their News Feeds. You may also receive updates from the Page in your
News Feed and your messages. You can remove the Pages you've "liked" from your
profile.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Some Pages contain content that comes directly from
the Page owner. Page owners can do this through online plugins, such as an
iframe, and it works just like the games and other applications you use
through Vookster. Because this content comes directly from the Page owner,
that Page may be able to collect information about you, just like any website.</font><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>

applications</u></b></font></p></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>About Vookster Platform</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Vookster Platform (or simply Platform) refers to
the way we help you share your information with the games, applications, and
websites you and your friends use. Vookster Platform also lets you bring your
friends with you, so you can connect with them off of Vookster. In these two
ways, Vookster Platform helps you make your experiences on the web more
personalized and social.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Remember that these games, applications and
websites are created and maintained by other businesses and developers who are
not part of Vookster, so you should always make sure to read their terms of
service and privacy policies.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<p> </p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;</p><p>
<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Controlling what information you share with
applications</u></b></font></p></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">When you go to a game or application, or connect
with a website using Vookster Platform, we give the game, application, or
website (sometimes referred to as just "Applications" or "Apps") your User ID,
as well your friends' User IDs (or your friend list).</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Your friend list helps the application make your
experience more social because it lets you find your friends on that
application. Your User ID helps the application personalize your experience
because it can connect your account on that application with your Vookster
account, and it can access your public information. This includes the
information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always
publicly available. If the application needs additional information, it will
have to ask you for specific permission.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">The “Apps you use” setting lets you control the
applications you use. You can see the permissions you have given these
applications, as well as the last time an application accessed your
information. You can also remove applications you no longer want, or turn off
all Platform applications. When you turn all Platform applications off, your
User ID is no longer given to applications, even when your friends use those
applications. But you will no longer be able to use any games, applications or
websites through Vookster.</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
Applications also get your age range, locale, and gender when you and your
friends visit them. Age range (e.g., 18-21) lets applications provide you with
age-appropriate content. Locale (e.g., en-US) lets applications know what
language you speak. Gender lets applications refer to you correctly. If you do
not want applications to receive this information about you, you can turn off
all Vookster applications using your Privacy Settings.<br>
Sometimes a game console, mobile phone, or other device might ask for permission
to share specific information with the games and applications you use on that
device (such as your public information). If you say okay, those applications
will not be able to access any other information about you without asking
specific permission from you or your friends.<br>
Instant Personalization sites receive your User ID and friend list when you
visit them. <br>
</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<p>
&nbsp;</p><p>
<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Controlling what is shared when the people
you share with use applications</u></b></font></p></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Just like when you share information by email or
elsewhere on the web, information you share on Vookster can be re-shared. This
means that if you share something on Vookster, anyone who can see it can share
it with others, including the games, applications, and websites they use.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Your friends and the other people you share
information with often want to share your information with applications to
make their experiences on those application more personalized and social. For
example, one of your friends might want to use a music application that allows
them to see what their friends are listening to. To get the full benefit of
that application, your friend would want to give the application her friend
list – which includes your User ID – so the application knows which of her
friends is also using it. Your friend might also want to share the music you
“like” on Vookster. If you have made that information public, then the
application can access it just like anyone else. But if you’ve shared your
likes with just your friends, the application could ask your friend for
permission to share them.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">You can control most of the information other
people can share with applications from the “Apps and Websites” settings page.
But these controls do not let you limit access to your public information and
friend list.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">If you want to completely block applications from
getting your information, you will need to turn off all Platform applications.
This means that you will no longer be able to use any games, applications or
websites.</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
If an application asks permission from someone else to access your information,
the application will be allowed to use that information only in connection with
the person that gave the permission and no one else.<br>
</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">

&nbsp;</p><p>
<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Logging in to another site using Vookster</u></b></font></p></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Vookster Platform also lets you log into other
applications and websites using your Vookster account. When you log in using
Vookster, we give the site your User ID, but we do not share your email
address or password with that website.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">If you already have an account on that website, the
site may also be able to connect that account with your Vookster account.
Sometimes it does this using what is called an "email hash", which is similar
to searching for someone on Vookster using an email address. Only the email
addresses in this case are encrypted so no email addresses are actually shared
between Vookster and the website.</font></div>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>How it works</b><br>
The website sends over an encrypted version of your email address, and we match
it with a database of email addresses that we have also encrypted. If there is a
match, then we tell the website the User ID associated with the email address.
This way, when you log into the website using Vookster, the website can link
your Vookster account to your account on that website.<br>
</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<p>
&nbsp;</p><p>
<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>About social plugins</u></b></font></p></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Social plugins are buttons, boxes, and stories
(such as the Like button) that other websites can use to present Vookster
content to you and create more social and personal experiences for you. While
you view these buttons, boxes, and stories on other sites, the content comes
directly from Vookster.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">If you make something public using a plugin, such
as posting a public comment on a newspaper's website, then that website can
access your comment (along with your User ID) just like everyone else. </font>
</div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
Websites that use social plugins can sometimes tell that you have engaged with
the social plugin. For example, they may know that you clicked on a Like button
in a social plugin.<br>
We receive data when you visit a site with a social plugin. We keep this data
for 90 days. After that, we remove your name or any other personally identifying
information from the data, or combine it with other people's data in a way that
it is no longer associated with you.<br>
</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<p>
&nbsp;</p><p>
<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>About instant personalization</u></b></font></p></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Instant personalization is a way for Vookster to
help partner sites (such as Bing and Rotten Tomatoes) create a more
personalized and social experience than a social plugin can offer. When you
visit a site using instant personalization, it will know some information
about you and your friends the moment you arrive. This is because instant
personalization sites can access your User ID, your friend list, and your
public information.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">The first time you visit an instant personalization
site, you will see a notification letting you know that the site has partnered
with Vookster to provide a personalized experience.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">The notification will give you the ability to
disable or turn off instant personalization for that site. If you do that,
that site is required to delete all of the information about you it received
from Vookster. In addition, we will prevent that site from accessing your
information in the future, even when your friends use that site.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">If you decide that you do not want to experience
instant personalization for all partner sites, you can disable instant
personalization from the “Apps and Websites” settings page. </font>
</div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">If you turn off instant personalization, partner
sites will not be able to access your public information, even when your
friends visit those sites.</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
If you turn off an instant personalization site after you have been using it or
visited it a few times (or after you have given it specific permission to access
your data), it will not automatically delete your data. But the site is
contractually required to delete your data if you ask it to.<br>
</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>How it works</b><br>
To join the instant personalization program, a potential partner must enter into
an agreement with us designed to protect your privacy. For example, this
agreement requires that the partner delete your data if you turn off instant
personalization when you first visit the site. It also prevents the partner from
accessing any information about you until you or your friends visit its site.<br>
</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Instant personalization partners sometimes use an
email hash process to see if any of their users are on Vookster and get those
users' User IDs. This process is similar to searching for someone on Vookster
using an email address, except in this case the email addresses are encrypted
so no actual email addresses are exchanged. The partner is also contractually
required not to use your User ID for any purpose (other than associating it
with your account) until you or your friends visit the site.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">When you visit an instant personalization site, we
provide the site with your User ID and your friend list (as well as your age
range, locale, and gender). The site can then connect your account on that
site with your friends' accounts to make the site instantly social. The site
can also access public information associated with any of the User IDs it
receives, which it can use to make the site instantly personalized. For
example, if the site is a music site, it can access your music interests to
suggest songs you may like, and access your friends' music interests to let
you know what they are listening to. Of course it can only access you or your
friends’ music interests if they are public. If the site wants any additional
information, it will have to get your specific permission.</font></div>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Public search engines</u></b></font></p></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Your Public Search setting controls whether people
who enter your name on a public search engine may see your public profile
(including in sponsored results). You can find your Public Search setting on
the “Apps and Websites” settings page. You can preview your public profile at:
<b>http://www.vookster.com/[Your Username or UserID]?p</b></font></div>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
This setting does not apply to search engines that access your information as an
application using Vookster Platform.<br>
If you turn your public search setting off and then search for yourself on a
public search engine, you may still see a preview of your profile. This is
because some search engines cache information for a period of time. You can

<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">If the advertiser chooses to run the ad (also known
as placing the order), we serve the ad to people who meet the criteria the
advertiser selected, but we do not tell the advertiser who any of those people
are. So, for example, if a person clicks on the ad, the advertiser might infer
that the person is an 18-to-35-year-old woman who lives in the US and likes
basketball. But we would not tell the advertiser who that person is.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">After the ad runs, we provide advertisers with
reports on how their ads performed. For example we give advertisers reports
telling them how many users saw or clicked on their ads. But these reports are
anonymous. We do not tell advertisers who saw or clicked on their ads.</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
Advertisers sometimes place cookies on your computer in order to make their ads
more effective. Learn more at:
http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp<br>
Sometimes we allow advertisers to target a category of user, like a "moviegoer"
or a "sci-fi fan." We do this by bundling characteristics that we believe are
related to the category. For example, if a person "likes" the "Star Trek" Page
and mentions "Star Wars" when they check into a movie theater, we may conclude
that this person is likely to be a sci-fi fan.<br>
</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Ads + social context</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Vookster Ads are sometimes paired with social
actions your friends have taken. For example, an ad for a sushi restaurant may
be paired with a news story that one of your friends likes that restaurant's
Vookster page.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">This is the same type of news story that could show
up in your News Feed, only we place it next to a paid advertisement to make
that ad more relevant and interesting.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">When you show up in one of these news stories, we
will only pair it with ads shown to your friends. If you do not want to appear
in stories paired with Vookster Ads, you can opt out using your “Edit social
ads” setting.</font></div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
Learn what happens when you click "Like" on an advertisement or an advertiser's
Vookster Page at: https://www.vookster.com/help/?faq=19399<br>
We may serve ads with social context (or serve just social context) on other
sites. These work just like the ads we serve on Vookster - the advertisers do
not receive any of your information.<br>
We sometimes allow businesses or anyone else to sponsor stories like the ones
that show up in your News Feed, subject to the audience set for that story.
While these are sponsored, they are different from ads because they don't
contain a message from the person that sponsored them. Your friends will see
these stories even if you have opted out of the "Show my social actions in
Vookster Ads" setting <br>
Your “Show my social actions in Vookster Ads” setting does not control ads about
Vookster's services and features. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande">
Games, applications and websites can serve ads directly to you if they have your
User ID.<br>
</font></p>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Sponsored stories</u></b></font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">Many of the things you do on Vookster (like
"liking" a Page) are posted to your Wall and shared in News Feed. But there's
a lot to read in News Feed. That's why we allow people to "sponsor" your
stories to make sure your friends see them. For example, if you RSVP to an
event hosted by a local restaurant, that restaurant may want to make sure your
friends see it so they can come too. If they do sponsor a story, that story
will appear in the same place ads usually do under the heading "Sponsored
Stories" or something similar. Only people that could originally see the story
can see the sponsored story, and no personal information about you (or your
friends) is shared with the sponsor.</font></div>

<font face="Lucida Grande"><b><u>Featured content</u></b></font></p></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">We like to tell you about some of the features your
friends use on Vookster to help you have a better experience. For example, if
your friend uses our friend finder tool to find more friends on Vookster, we
may tell you about it to encourage you to use it as well. This of course means
your friend may similarly see suggestions based on the things you do. But we
will try to only show it to friends that could benefit from your experience.</font><p> </p></div>

with children, and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe
internet practices. To learn more, visit our Safety Center.</font></div>
<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
<font face="Lucida Grande">To protect minors, we may put special safeguards in
place (such as placing restrictions on the ability of adults to share and
connect with them), recognizing this may provide minors a more limited

harm</b><br>
We may share your information in response to a legal request (like a search
warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law
requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from
jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief
that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that
jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We
may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to:
detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect
ourselves and you from violations of our Statement of Rights and
