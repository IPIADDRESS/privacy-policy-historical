</ul>
<p>We may also collect information by other means and will take all reasonable steps to inform you if and when we do.</p>

<h3>What security measures do we use to protect your personal information?</h3>
<p>The security of your personal information is given a high priority. We take all reasonable steps to securely store your personal information so that it is protected from unauthorised use, access, modification or disclosure. This includes both physical and electronic security measures.</p>
<h3>Protecting your account from unauthorised access?</h3>
<p>Anyone who knows your account PIN or online username and password can access your account.
