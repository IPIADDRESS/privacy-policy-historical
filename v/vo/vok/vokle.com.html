            A useful bug report normally has two qualities:
            <strong>
              reproducible
            </strong>
            and

            <br>
            <ul class="normal">
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Be clear - explain it so others can reproduce the bug
              </li>
              <li>
                One bug per report

              <li>
                No bug is too trivial to report - small bugs may hide big bugs
