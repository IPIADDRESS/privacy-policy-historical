<p>Advertisements appearing on the Six Apart Site, Product or Services may be delivered to users by Six Apart or one of our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Six Apart and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p>Six Apart does not share any personally identifiable information with advertisers. Six Apart may share general demographic information (such as aggregated statistics about members’ interests and occupations) and non-personally identifiable information (such as browser type and IP addresses) with advertisers and partners. Six Apart does not give advertisers access to your individual personal account information. However, by selecting, interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.</p>
<p>From time to time, Six Apart or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on VOX. You may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate.

<p>Six Apart may revise, modify or update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your particular Six Apart account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p>
<h3>Confidentiality and Security</h3>
<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make efforts to ensure security on our systems.</p>
<ul><li><p>We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you.</p></li>
<li><p>Your account information is password-protected.</p></li>
<li><p>In certain areas, VOX uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p></li></ul>
<p>If Six Apart learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using VOX or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of those sites, products and services. We may post a notice on our applicable web sites if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the applicable web sites. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sixapart.com">privacy@sixapart.com</a>.</p>
