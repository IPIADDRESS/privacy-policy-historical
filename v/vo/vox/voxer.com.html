If you are a user of the Voxer Business service, your data is subject to the policies of the entity that has contracted with Voxer for that service and not this Privacy Policy; please contact such entity regarding their policies and practices.</p>

<p>Information We Receive or Collect.

Other users may provide us contact information they have about you, such as your email address, phone number or your name, which we use to determine if you are a Product user.
