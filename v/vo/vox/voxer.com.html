                                <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) governs your use of the Voxer website (<a href="../../../index.html">www.voxer.com</a>), other websites owned by Voxer (collectively, the “Voxer Site”), the Voxer Walkie Talkie App,
                                    Voxer Pro App (the “App”) and any other products provided to you (collectively with the App, the “Products”) by VoxerNet LLC (and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Voxer) (collectively
                                    “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Voxer”). If you are a user of the Voxer Business service, your data is subject to the policies of the entity that has contracted with Voxer for that service and not this Privacy Policy; please
                                    contact such entity regarding their policies and practices.</p>

                                    <li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</li>
                                    <li>When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</li>

                                    remove this content from your device or account, copies of this User Communications Content will remain viewable on the devices of third party users with whom you have communicated and will be stored on our servers
                                    for a period of time. </p>

                                    email address, phone number or your name, which we use to determine if you are a Product user. If you are already a Product user, then we may share your name with others so that they can add you to their contact list
                                    by choosing your name off of a list of users available via our Products. If you enable “Privacy Mode” in the App, you will no longer be searchable by other users and your information will not be shared in this way.
                                </p>

                                <p>How We Use Information. We use the information collected under this Privacy Policy to operate, maintain, develop, improve, and provide you the features and functionality of the Products and to develop new products. In addition,
                                    we, and our third party service providers, use information collected from use of the App and the Voxer Site to target and track our marketing efforts and advertising.</p>

                                <p>Third-Party Advertising Partners. We use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf across the Internet. These service providers collect information about your visits to our website.
                                    This information is collected through use of a web beacon, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. Web beacons do not collect names or contact information, but may record other information

                                <p>How We Protect Information. Voxer takes reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We keep your account information
                                    and content on a secure server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) while it is being transmitted. However,
                                    you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, messages sent to or from the Voxer Site and Products may not be secure.</p>
