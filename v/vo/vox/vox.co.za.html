	            <p>There are two main types of personal information - Identifiable personal data, and non-identifiable personal data.&nbsp; Identifiable data generally includes a customer’s name, address, telephone numbers; gender; IP address; billing information (such as a credit card number) etc. <br>
	            Non-identifiable data generally includes: a postal code; the date and time sites are accessed (if you gather this); pages visited;(usually done to monitor demand and improve usefulness of the site); the type of browser being used; the operating system and the type of personal computer being used to access the services.</p>
	            <p>In terms of the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communications-Related Information Act, 2002, all telecoms service providers, including ISPs are obliged to obtain and keep certain identifiable personal data of customers when entering into service contracts. This includes in addition to the above, in the case of a person: ID number; residential and business addresses; and a certified copy of the customer’s ID document. In the case of a company: all of the above as well as the company’s registration number and a certified copy of the customer’s business letterhead. While this expansive interpretation of personal information might be seen as overly cautious, we advise you to identify or define all these requirements as personal information</p>
