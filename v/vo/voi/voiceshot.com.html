        <p>Privacy Policy</p> 
        <b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
        VoiceShot is the sole owner of the information collected 
        on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information 
        to others in ways different from what is disclosed in 
        this statement. VoiceShot collects information from our 
        users at several different points on our website. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Registration</b><br>
        In order to use this website, a user must first complete 
        the registration form. During registration a user is required 
        to give their contact information (such as name and email 
        address). This information is used to contact the user 
        about the services on our site for which they have expressed 
        interest. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Account Privacy</b><br>
        VoiceShot respects your privacy. We will not monitor your 
        audio messages, read or share database upload information 
        with any third party without your expressed permission 
        unless we believe in good faith that such action is necessary 
        to either comply with the law or properly enforce the 
        VoiceShot terms of service agreement. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Order</b><br>
        We request information from the user on our order form. 
        Here a user must provide contact information (like name) 
        and financial information (like credit card number, expiration 
        date). This information is used for billing purposes and 
        to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing 
        an order, this contact information is used to get in touch 
        with the user. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Cookies</b><br>
        A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard 
        drive containing information about the user. Usage of 
        a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable 
        information while on our site. Once the user closes their 
        browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by 
        setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have 
        to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time 
        while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they 
        may not use our site. Cookies can also enable us to track 
        and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience 
        on our site. <br>
        <br>
        Some of our business partners use cookies on our site 
        (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access 
        to or control over these cookies. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Log Files</b><br>
        We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the 
        site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic 
        information for aggregate use. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sharing</b><br>
        We will share aggregated demographic information with 
        our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any 
        personal information that can identify any individual 
        person. <br>
        <br>
        We partner with another party to provide specific services. 
        When the user signs up for these services, we will share 
        names, or other contact information that is necessary 
        for the third party to provide these services. <br>
        <br>
        These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable 
        information except for the purpose of providing these 
        services. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Links</b><br>
        This web site contains links to other sites. Please be 
        aware that VoiceShot is not responsible for the privacy 
        practices of such other sites. We encourage our users 
        to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
        statements of each and every web site that collects personally 
        identifiable information. This privacy statement applies 
        solely to information collected by this Web site. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Security</b><br>
        This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ 
        information. When users submit sensitive information via 
        the website, your information is protected both online 
        and off-line. <br>
        <br>
        When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive 
        information (such as credit card number), that information 
        is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption 
        software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, 
        such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of 
        Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
        Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, 
        or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. <br>
        <br>
        While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
        online, we also do everything in our power to protect 
        user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, 
        not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is 
        restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the 
        information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
        billing clerk or a customer service representative) are 
        granted access to personally identifiable information. 
        Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our 
        security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well 
        as any time new policies are added, our employees are 
        notified and/or reminded about the importance we place 
        on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ 
        information is protected. Finally, the servers that we 
        store personally identifiable information on are kept 
        in a secure environment. <br>
        <br>
        If you have any questions about the security at our website, 
        you can send an email to info@voiceshot.com. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Special Offers</b><br>
        We send all new members a welcoming email to verify their 
        email address. Established members will occasionally receive 
        information on products, services, special deals, and 
        a newsletter. <br>
        <b><br>
        Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b><br>
        If a user’s personally identifiable information changes 
        (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires 
        our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, 
        update or remove that user’s personal data provided to 
        us. This can usually be done at the member information 
        page or by emailing our Customer Support. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
        Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having 
        their information used for purposes not directly related 
        to our site at the point where we ask for the information. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Users of our site are always notified when their information 
        is being collected by any outside parties. We do this 
        so our users can make an informed choice as to whether 
        they should proceed with services that require an outside 
        party, or not. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post 
        those changes on our Homepage so our users are always 
        aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and 
        under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any 
        point we decide to use personally identifiable information 
        in a manner different from that stated at the time it 
        was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. 
        Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
        information in this different manner. We will use information 
        in accordance with the privacy policy under which the 
        information was collected.
