This policy briefly describes the personally identifiable information that voip.com collects from its customers and prospective customers and the steps that it takes to safeguard such information.</p>
        <a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.voip.com&amp;sealid=101"><img src="images/clickseal.gif" alt="TRUSTe Verify Mark" height="73" width="91" align="left" class="left_side_noborder"></a>
        <p>Voip.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.
