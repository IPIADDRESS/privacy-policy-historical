	<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
	<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal 
		information for our services on the Voice123.com website. 
		It applies generally to the Voice123.com website and other 
		related websites where this policy appears in the footer of 
		the page (“the Sites”). Some Voice123-branded 
		websites, Voice123-sponsored, or websites we operate may be 
		governed by separate privacy policies. The policy that applies 
		on any of our domains or subdomains is always the policy that 
		appears in the footer of each website.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Our parent companies, sibling companies, subsidiaries’ 
		and joint ventures’ privacy practices are similar to those 
		described in this Privacy Policy. Subject to the requirements of 
		applicable law, we strive to provide a consistent set of privacy 
		practices throughout the global Voice123 community. By accepting 
		the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service in registration, you 
		expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure 
		of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. 
		This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users 
		and is otherwise effective on April 25th, 2007.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Collection</strong></p>
	<p>
		You can browse the Sites without telling us who you are or 
		revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give 
		us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. 
		If you choose to provide us with personal information, you 
		consent to the transfer and storage of that information to our 
		servers located in the United States.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>We may collect and store the following personal information:</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		• email address, physical contact information,( for 
		example in the registration page for Voice Talents and Voice 
		Producer, “Talents: register now” page, we may 
		collect your first and last name, your phone number, your email 
		address, a password and your country) and (depending on the service 
		used) sometimes financial information, such as credit card or bank 
		account numbers;
		<br>
		• transactional information based on your activities on the 
		Sites (such as posting information, auditioning, giving ratings, 
			and content you generate or that relates to your account);
		<br>
		• information you provide to purchase or buy a service;
		<br>
		• community discussions, chats, correspondence through the 
		Site, and correspondence sent to us;
		<br>
		• computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic 
		to and from the Site, and ad data;
		<br>
		• other information, including IP address and standard web 
		log information, and
		<br>
		• supplemental information from third parties. (For example, 
		if the information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask you 
		to send us additional information (such as your business registration), 
		or to answer additional questions online to help verify your 
		information.)
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		We use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods 
		and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use 
		personally identifiable information for any other purposes. 
		We use Cybersource to forfill payments. We may share personally 
		identifiable information with them (the information that we share 
		is basically related to the credit card holder which is: credit 
		card number, expiration date, name of the card holder, billing 
		address, city, state or providence, zip or postal code and 
		country), you can find their privacy policy at 
		<a href="http://cybersource.com/">Cybersource</a>.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		You may also choose Paypal to bill you for goods and services. 
		This company does not retain share, store or use personally 
		identifiable information for any other purposes. If you use 
		Paypal, their privacy policy governs their collection and use. 
		You can find their privacy policy at 
		<a href="https://www.paypal.com/">Paypal</a>.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>
	<p>
		We don't share, sell, or rent your personal information to 
		third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit 
		consent. We may combine your information with information we 
		collect from other companies (such as demographic data) to 
		improve and personalize our services.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may 
		opt-out of receiving them by using the link included in each 
		email communication or by contacting our Customer Service Department 
		at <a href="http://voice123.com/doc/help.html">Customer 
		Service (by email, chat &amp; phone)</a>.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Use</strong></p>
	<p>
		Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide 
		you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience to 
		complete the transaction process. You agree that we may use your 
		personal information to:
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		• provide the services and customer support you request;
		<br>
		• resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
		<br>
		• prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities and 
		enforce our Terms of Service;
		<br>
		• customize, measure, and improve our services and the Sites' 
		content and layout;
		<br>
		• tell you about targeted marketing, service updates, 
		promotional offers based on your communication preferences, 
		compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Our Disclosure of Your Information</strong></p> 
	<p>
		We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, 
		enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other 
		content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, 
		property, or safety.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>We may also share your personal information with:</p>
	<br>
	<p> 
		• members of our corporate family to help detect and prevent 
		potentially illegal acts and provide joint services; (Our corporate 
		affiliates will market only to users who request these services.)
		<br>
		• service providers under contract who help with our business 
		operations; (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, 
		affiliates, and community programs)
		<br>
		• other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send 
		your information; (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly 
		notified and consent to when using a specific service)
		<br>
		• law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response 
		to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or 
		alleged illegal activity;
		<br>
		• other business entities, should we plan to merge with or 
		be acquired by that business entity.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and 
		our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not 
		otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, 
		other government officials, or other third parties without a 
		subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, 
		except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of 
		information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or 
		financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Activity Associated with Your Account</strong></p>
	<p>
		Your UserID, name, email, and/or company name may be displayed 
		throughout <a href="http://voice123.com">Voice123</a> and is 
		therefore available to the public. All of your activities on the Site 
		will be traceable to any of this fields. Other people can see your 
		postings, auditions that you have submitted in the past, any content 
		you have added, ratings, ratings and associated comments and so on.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><trong>Using Information from Voice123</trong></p>
	<p>
		Our Sites enable you to share personal and financial information 
		in order to complete transactions. We encourage you to disclose 
		your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. 
		We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information 
		and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and 
		security policies of your trading partner before entering into a 
		transaction and choosing to share your information. To help 
		protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other 
		users' contact and financial information in order to facilitate your 
		transactions. When users are involved in a transaction, they may 
		have access to each other's name, user ID, email address, and other 
		contact and financial information. In all cases, you must give other 
		users the option to remove themselves from your database and the 
		opportunity to review what information you have collected about 
		them.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>You agree to use user information only for:</p>
	<br>
	<p> 
		• Voice123 transaction-related purposes that are not 
		unsolicited commercial messages;
		<br>
		• services offered through Voice123, or
		<br>
		• other purposes that a user expressly chooses.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Cookies/Web beacons</strong></p>
	<p>
		We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) 
		on certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, 
		customize our services, measure promotional effectiveness, and 
		promote trust and safety. We link the information we store in 
		cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while 
		on our site in order to customize the user experience.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>A few important things you should know about cookies are that:</p>
	<br>
	<p> 
		• We offer certain features that are only available through 
		the use of cookies.
		<br>
		• We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your 
		signed-in status.
		<br>
		• You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser 
		permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the Sites.
		<br>
		• You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages 
		of the Sites that we do not control. (For example, if you view a 
		web page created by another user, there may be a "cookie" 
		placed by that web page.)
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Third parties (such as our tracking utility and security scanning 
		companies) employ a software technology called Web beacons (a.k.a. 
		clear gifs or Web bugs), that help us better manage content on our 
		site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny 
		graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, 
		and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast 
		to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, 
		Web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the 
		size of the period at the end of this sentence. These third parties 
		do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ 
		personally identifiable information.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>No spam, spyware or spoofing</strong></p>
	<p>
		We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your Voice123 
		notification preferences so that we can communicate with you according 
		to your preferences. You are not licensed to add other Voice123 users, 
		even a user who has purchased a service from you, to your mail list 
		(email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report 
		Voice123 related spam or spoof emails to Voice123, please forward 
		the email to <a href="mailto: help@voice123.com">help@voice123</a>.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Account Protection</strong></p> 
	<p>
		Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters, 
		and special characters and do not disclose your Voice123 password to 
		anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information 
		with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken 
		in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you 
		may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be 
		subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if 
		your password has been compromised for any reason, you should 
		immediately notify Voice123 and change your password.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information</strong></p>
	<p>
		You can see, review, correct and change most of your personal 
		information by logging into your account at 
		<a href="http://voice123.com">Voice123</a>. Generally, we will not manually 
		modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify 
		your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information 
		if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may 
		not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close 
		your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as 
		reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance 
		with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed 
		accounts in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees 
		owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, 
		enforce our Terms of Service, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
	<p>
		The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter 
		sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security 
		number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information 
		using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS). To learn more about SSL/TLS 
		click here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssl">Secure Socket Layer 
		technology (SSL/TLS)</a>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. 
		We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools 
		(encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal 
		information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you 
		probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions 
		or private communications and other users may abuse or misuse your personal 
		information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we work 
		very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise and you should not 
		expect, that your personal information or private communications will always 
		remain private.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Third Parties</strong></p>
	<p>
		Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document 
		addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If 
		you disclose your information to others, whether they are talents, 
		producers, voice seekers, agents or any other type of users on our Site or 
		other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use 
		or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Since Voice123 does 
		not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the 
		privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to ask questions 
		before you disclose your personal information to others.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		This site may contain links to other Web sites. Please note that when you 
		click on one of these links, you are entering another site. Voice123 is 
		not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Testimonials</strong></p>
	<br>
	<p>
		We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally 
		identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the 
		customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name 
		along with their testimonial.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Live Chat</strong></p> 
	<p>
		We offer Live Chat service for Voice Talents, Voice Actors and Voice 
		Seekers, if you use it you should be aware that any personally 
		identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used 
		for service improvement purposes and could be used to send you unsolicited 
		messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information 
		you choose to submit in the chat.
	</p>
	<div class="sep"></div>
	<p><strong>Voice123 Industry Directory</strong></p> 
	<p>
		We also post media industry resources on our web site which may contain 
		information such as the company's name and the link to the companies 
		that belong to the media industry.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		The Site may provide hyperlinks to third party Web sites or access to 
		third party content. Voice123 does not control, endorse, or 
		guarantee content found in such sites. You agree that Voice123
