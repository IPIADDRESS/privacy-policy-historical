<br>
<h4>
<strong>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?</strong>

<p>We collect IP addresses and what pages/uploads a user has visited. The purpose of this is to understand where most of our traffic comes from so we can provide a better service in terms of speed, performance and loading times.</p>
<br>
<h4>
<strong>When do we collect information?</strong>
</h4>
<p>We collect information when you register as a user on our website, where we ask for a username and e-mail address.</p>

You will also receive an e-mail requesting you to activate your account. This is so we can be sure if you need to reset your password, a new password can be sent to you via e-mail securely.<p></p>
</li><li>In some cases, we may use your e-mail address to check against logs with our mail service - this is usually only the case when a user hasn't received their activation/password reset e-mail. We can check to see why the e-mail wasn't sent and let the user know.</li>
