		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
			You may notice that Victoria's Secret PINK (VS PINK) has a new version of its privacy policy. 
			Our privacy practices haven't changed. But our policy has gotten a makeover to make it easier 
			for you to read and navigate.
		</p>
		<p>
			This privacy policy explains what personal information is collected through this Web site, 
			how that information is used, to whom it's disclosed, and how it's safeguarded. This policy 
			applies only to personal information collected through the Web site, microsites, and mobile 
			sites of VS PINK that display this policy. By "personal information" we mean your identifying
			information (like name, home address, and email address), and possibly descriptive information 
			(like tastes and preferences) if coupled with your identifying information ("personally 
			identifying information"). We may refer to VS PINK as "we," "us," or "our" throughout this 
			privacy policy.
		</p>
		<p>
			This privacy policy answers these questions:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What personal information is collected at our Web site, and how is it used?</li>
			<li>How does this site interact with third-party Web sites and content?</li>
			<li>What information do we share with third parties (or what information may they access 
				because of the services they provide to us)? </li>
			<li>What choices do you have over how your information is used?</li>
			<li>Does VS PINK's privacy policy differ from VS PINK Nation's policy?</li>
			<li>Does our policy differ for visitors from outside the U.S.? </li>
			<li>Can you update your personal information? </li>
			<li>How do we address children's and minors' privacy? </li>
			<li>How do we secure your information on our site? </li>
			<li>Whom do you contact with questions or concerns? </li>
			<li>When was this policy last updated? </li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AT OUR WEB SITE AND HOW IS IT USED?</b></p>
		<ol class="numberedList">
			<li><span class="underlined">Information Collected Directly from You and Others through this Site</span>
				<p>We collect personal information directly from you to do all the things typically associated with electronic and mobile commerce Web sites. Examples of the information we collect include name, address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, personal preferences, credit card number, purchase and ordering information, demographical information, and sizing information.</p>
				<p>This information is collected at various places: for instance, when you check out with your online order; subscribe to catalogs, email offers, and mobile messaging offers; participate in surveys, contests, or sweepstakes; or interact with special-event or program offers.</p>
				<p>We collect information about you; and, when you provide it, we collect information about those you know. For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders. We use this information to do things like:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>process your online orders; </li>
					<li>open an online account at your request; </li>
					<li>personalize your online experience with content and offers that are tailored to your interests; </li>
					<li>provide customer service, whether it's responding to a request or following up on an order; </li>
					<li>include you in surveys and contests; </li>
					<li>enable you to post your content, such as comments, images; </li>
					<li>facilitate networks of online social activity centered around our products and services;</li> 
					<li>enable you to interact with third-party content service providers, whether by linking to their sites, viewing their content within our Web environment, or by viewing our content within their Web environment; and</li> 
					<li>market our products and services:  for instance, by adding you to our email or postal-mail list when you make an online purchase. </li>		
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li><span class="underlined">Information We Observe or Collect through Technology </span><br><br>
				<ol class="alphaList">
					<li>Navigational Information
When you visit this Web site, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate. Navigational information is largely anonymous in the sense that it doesn't contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you. However, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it.</li>
					<li>Cookies and Clear gifs
To better understand what you do while on our site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that's stored by your Web browser on your computer. It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Web site, and remember you and your online purchases when you return. This helps us improve our site, provide better customer service, personalize your online experience, and personalize offers to you based on your unique tastes and purchase history.<br><br>We also use clear-gifs (also known as a Web beacon or Web bug) on our Web site and in our emails. A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time our Web site or email in question is viewed. Clear gifs in e-mails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized online experience. Overall, these technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like mostâ€“for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Web site. Cookies and clear gifs also allow us to associate your online navigational or transactional information with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, and email address). We'll associate this information only for our purposes: to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><span class="underlined">Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology </span><br>
				<p>Third-party service providers help us analyze our visitor's site and purchase preferences, and may help us deliver ads to you about our products through banner ads when you visit other web sites (often referred to as "online network advertising"). The following provides more information about these service providers and the choices you have with respect to their services. </p>
				<ol class="alphaList">
					<li>Analysis<br>We contract with analytics companies to better understand your use of our Web sites, and Web capabilities like embeddable widgets. They accomplish this by using some or all of the technologies described in <span class="underlined">Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology,</span> above,</li>
					<li>Advertising<br>We contract with third-party advertising companies that, in turn, collect non-personally identifying information by placing cookies on your browser when you visit us here. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, credit card information, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visit to deliver our ads on this and other Web sites through their online advertising networks. These companies also provide this information to us which we, in turn, use to gauge how effective our ads are. If you'd like more information about how online network advertising works and what your choices are for the information that's collected via these third-party cookies, please see <span class="underlined">What Choices do You have Over how Your Information is Used?,</span> below.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>		
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p><b>HOW DOES THIS WEB SITE INTERACT WITH THIRD-PARTY OR OUR SISTER BRANDSâ€™ WEB SITES AND CONTENT?</b></p>
	
		<p>We may enable you to navigate to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content. We do this for your convenience. We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don't control and aren't responsible for their Web practices. Whether their content appears within our Web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Web site for another site to view it, those service provider's terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience (unless there's a conspicuously posted statement by us that says otherwise). Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices.</p>
		<p>Here's a partial list of the sites or content of these third parties: </p>
		<ol class="alphaList">
			<li><span class="underlined">Interactive Maps</span><br>We may facilitate easy access to the online maps of content providers like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! There you can get quick location, driving, and contact information for our stores.</li>
			<li><span class="underlined">Sweepstakes, Contests, and Survey Sites</span><br>
			We may rely on the expertise of third-party service providers to run sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. Navigation to these sites may be seamless so that it appears you're still in our Web site environment. In these cases, the third-party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. So please take note of who's running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.</li>
			<li><span class="underlined">Social Networking or Other User-Generated-Content Sites, and Other Websites</span><br>
			We may at times facilitate easy access to third-party sites, like social networking sites and other sites that host user-generated content. This may include easy click-through access or even "single-sign on" to these sites. The third-party's privacy policy applies to any personal information you provide at these sites.</li>
			<li><span class="underlined">The Angel Credit Card Site</span><br>
			We may enable you to navigate easily to the site of World Financial Network National Bank (WFNNB), where you can apply for the Angel card and pay invoices online. WFNNB issues and owns the Angel credit card accounts. When you apply online for an Angel credit card or pay your account online, you leave our site and interact directly with WFNNB. Any information you provide to WFNNB is subject to WFNNB's terms, conditions, and policies, including its privacy policy. </li>
			<li><span class="underlined">Third-Party Rewards or Membership Programs</span><br>
			We may interact with certain unrelated companies that offer their customers memberships to participate in programs, which may include rewards for purchases from us. If you become a member of one of these programs or purchase something from us at this Web site through such a program, we may provide the company administering the membership program enough information about you or your purchase (like contact information, transaction date, transaction amount, and order number), to enable it to honor your membership. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the companies sponsoring these membership programs. Their terms, conditions, and policies apply to any information that's provided to them to further their programs.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This Web site may interact seamlessly with other Web sites within the Victoriaâ€™s Secret family of brands.  For example, youâ€™ll notice that when you purchase items through this site, youâ€™re transferred to the Web site of Victoriaâ€™s Secret.  So although youâ€™re technically in a different Web environment, the privacy policies of Victoriaâ€™s Secret and VS PINK are materially the same.  This privacy policy reflects the sum total of the capabilities of these interconnected Web sites.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES AND OUR SISTER BRANDS (OR WHAT INFORMATION MAY THEY ACCESS BECAUSE OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO US)?</b></p>
			<ol class="alphaList">
				<li>Our Sister Brands<br>We may also share the information described in this policy, like postal and email address, customer preferences, and purchase history within our corporate family so that our affiliates may market to you.  Our affiliates include such brands as Bath &amp; Body Works, Beauty Avenues, Inc., C.O. Bigelow, Henri Bendel, the La Senza family of brands (including La Senza Girl,  La Senza Express, and La Senza Spirit), MAST Industries, Inc., and Slatkin &amp; Co.</li>
				<li>Contractors<br>We use third-party "back-office" contractors to help handle parts of our business because of their expertise, resources, or scale. They help us do things like fulfill orders, process payments, monitor site activity, maintain databases, administer and monitor emails, administer and send mobile messages, and provide consulting services. Contractors may also assist us in hosting microsites and mobile Web sites where you may provide personal information about you and others you know; and where they may observe information about you in the same way as described above (see What Personal Information Is Collected At Our Web Site, and How Is It Used?, above.)</li>
				<li>Other Marketers<br>We may share your name, postal address, and summary purchase information with other merchants and merchant exchanges. Other merchants may, in turn, use this information to send you offers on their products and services. If you don't want this information shared with these merchants and exchanges, please <a target="_blank" href="http://www.victoriassecret.com/html/custsrvc/contact/personalinfo/">click here.</a></li>
				<li>Law Enforcement and Emergency Response<br>We may disclose specific information about our Web-site visitors if we have a good-faith belief that it's necessary or authorized under the law to protect our customers, the public, or our business.</li>
				<li>Sale or Merger<br>In the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets that are transferred as part of the transaction.</li>	
			</ol>
		<br>
		<p><b>WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE OVER HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS USED?</b></p>
			<ol class="alphaList">
				<li><span class="underlined">Email</span><br>If at any time you want to stop future delivery of our email offers, simply follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of each message or complete the <a target="_blank" href="http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2?a=0&amp;aid=477251442&amp;email=&amp;fp_redirected=1">removal from e-mail form.</a>  This will stop future email offers from us, but won't stop operational or transactional messages such as email confirmations of your online orders, or customer service communications. We may occasionally provide you with the opportunity to opt in to receive email messages from third parties. If you do opt in, we'll share your e-mail address with the specific third party with which you have opted in. Please review their privacy policies to see how they treat your personal information.</li>
				<li><span class="underlined">Mobile Messaging</span><br>If you've signed up for mobile messaging (e.g., SMS and MMS) offers but later decide you no longer wish to receive them, simply follow the opt-out instructions included in the mobile message.</li>
				<li><span class="underlined">Postal Mail</span><br>If you'd like to specify your preferences for postal mailers from us, simply follow the instructions on each catalog, or dial 1-800-411-5116.

				<li><span class="underlined">Cookies, Clear Gifs, and Online Network Advertising</span><br>
				You may always choose to block cookies or even clear cookies from your computer. Simply follow your browser's instructions on how to block and clear cookies. Note that blocking cookies may not block the "first-party" cookies that are placed on your computer when you visit this site. By first-party cookies, we mean those cookies (whether placed by us or a contractor) that help us see how visitors use our site, and enable us to deliver our ads on our site (as opposed to ads on an online advertising network of third-party Web sites). Clearing cookies after each visit here will prevent observations from multiple sessions being aggregated over time. Please consider the consequences of blocking or clearing cookies. Many Web sites rely on their cookies to provide you with services or features that you have requested or expect.

				<li><span class="underlined">Other Marketers</span><br>If you don't want your basic contact and purchase information shared with other marketers (other than our affiliates), please <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.victoriassecret.com/html/custsrvc/contact/personalinfo/">click here.</a></li>
				<li><span class="underlined">Our Affiliates</span><br>If you don't want your contact and purchase information shared between our affiliates (such as Bath &amp; Body Works), please call 1-800-411-5116 and request not to have your information shared.</li>

		<p><b>DOES VS PINKâ€™S PRIVACY POLICY DIFFER FROM VS PINK NATIONâ€™S POLICY?</b></p>
		<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vspink.com/pink_nation/">VS PINK Nation</a> is a membership program that has its own unsubscribe and preference procedures, which we specifically note if you join VS PINK Nation.  As a result, the preferences you specify for VS PINK and Victoriaâ€™s Secret (e.g., opting out of postal mail, email, and text messages), which are described above wonâ€™t affect your VS PINK Nation preferences and vice-versa.  Be sure to follow VS PINK Nation instructions to specify your preferences for VS PINK Nation.  The privacy practices of both VS PINK and VS PINK Nation are otherwise the same.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>WHAT IS THE POLICY FOR VISITORS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S.?</b></p>
		<p>This is a U.S. Web-commerce site.  This privacy policy governs the information collected at this site irrespective of where youâ€™re located when you access it, browse it, interact with it, and make purchases through it (including those that are shipped to addresses outside the U.S.).  This means your personal information may be stored outside of the province, state, and/or country in which you reside, and processed by us, an affiliate or a third-party service provider as described in this privacy policy.  Moreover, governmental bodies that have jurisdiction (e.g., courts and law enforcement agencies) may be entitled to access your personal information.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>HOW MAY I UPDATE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</b></p>
		<p>We prefer to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date. You may update or modify your billing- and shipping-related information by <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.victoriassecret.com/html/custsrvc/youraccount/?rfnbr=8677">logging onto Your Account.</a> You may also update or modify your catalog mailing information by <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.victoriassecret.com/html/custsrvc/contact/mailings/?rfnbr=8678">clicking here.</a>  VS PINK Nation members may <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vspink.com/pink_nation/index.jsp">click here</a> to update their VS PINK Nation account information.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>HOW DO WE ADDRESS CHILDREN'S AND MINORS' PRIVACY?</b></p>
		<p>We do not knowingly collect or maintain information provided by children under the age of 13.  Moreover, we implement certain age-related safeguards to meet state-specific requirements. </p>
		<br>
		<p><b>HOW DO WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION ON OUR SITE?</b></p>
		<p>This Web site has the following types of security measures: limited access data-centers, firewall technology, and secure-socket-layer (SSL) certificate authentication. SSL is encryption technology that provides security for information that's transmitted over the Internet. This site accepts orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through SSL technology-for example, 4.0 versions or higher of Netscape Navigator, versions 5.01 or higher of Internet Explorer, versions 0.8 or higher of Firefox, and versions 1.2 or higher of Safari.</p>
		<p>While we implement the above security measures on this site, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible. </p>	
		<br>
		<p><b>WHOM MAY YOU CONTACT WITH QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?</b></p>
		<p>If you have questions or concerns with respect to our Privacy Policy, please feel free to <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.victoriassecret.com/html/custsrvc/contact/">contact us.</a></p>
