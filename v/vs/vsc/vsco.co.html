<h4 id="l1">1. <span>HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR INFORMATION</span></h4>
<p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong> We ask for certain information such as your name and e-mail address if you register for a User account with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). If you purchase products or services or sign up for a paid subscription, then we will also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. If you sign up for our e-mail mailing list, we will collect your name and e-mail address. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Information we may receive from third parties:</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Visual Supply application, linking your account to the Visual Supply Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Visual Supply. This information could include, but is not limited to any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Visual Supply’s websites or Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Inviting a third party to use our Service.</strong> If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service, we will ask you for that person’s email address and automatically send an email invitation to the invitee. We store this information to send this email, to register the invitee if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. Unless the invitee becomes a registered User of the Service, we do not use the invitee’s email address for marketing purposes, and we do not share the invitee’s email address with third parties other than Visual Supply’s service providers. The invitee may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our database at <a href="mailto:privacy@vsco.co">privacy@vsco.co</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Analytics information.</strong> We may directly collect analytics data, or  use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We may collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Cookies information:</strong> When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Visual Supply help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Log file information:</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Clear gifs/web beacons information:</strong> When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Device identifiers:</strong>  When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets) or computer, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.”  Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device.  A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Visual Supply.  A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service.  A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service.  Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Location data:</strong> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Commercial and marketing communications:</strong> We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you.  We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers.  If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences.  We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).  You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Use of certain service type information we collect about you.</strong> We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; © to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; and (i) to provide advertising to your browser or device.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Ads on our Service:</strong> We may also share certain information with our business partners to deliver online advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Visual Supply may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, and clear gifs, etc.) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service  and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Visual Supply does not sell, rent, or share your personal information with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes, unless you choose in advance to have your information shared for this purpose. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Visual Supply to show an ad to a certain audience and you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The Visual Supply Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.
