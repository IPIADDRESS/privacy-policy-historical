<p>This privacy policy applies to the core V.me services, so start here. If you sign up for additional V.me services, there may be additional or different privacy policies (such as your card issuer’s privacy policy) which describe any additional or different data practices that apply to those services. Also, other Visa products and websites have their own separate privacy policies. The Visa.com privacy policy does not apply to V.me.</p>
<p>This privacy policy was last updated November 08, 2012.</p>

<h2>How we share Personal Information</h2>

<ul>
<li>With merchants you pay through V.me to complete your transactions, resolve disputes, help prevent fraud and provide customer service.

<li>With the financial institutions that issued the cards you enrolled in V.me for customer service, usage analysis, fraud prevention, and V.me related marketing.</li>
<li>With companies and vendors that help us to operate our business. We require that they protect your information and only use it for that purpose.</li>
<li>To comply with law or other legal obligations such as responding to subpoenas.</li>
<li>To protect our rights or property, or that of our users.</li>
<li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential or suspected illegal activities, fraud, threats to the personal safety of any person, or violations of the V.me terms and conditions.</li>
<li>With other companies that are owned by Visa as allowed by law.</li>
<li>With a purchaser of Visa (or the majority of its assets).</li>

<h2>How you can access and edit your Personal Information</h2>
<p>You can review and edit your Personal Information at any time by logging in to your account.</p>
<h2>How we protect your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Visa uses firewalls and Secure Socket Layers to help protect the Personal Information we collect from you when it is being communicated to us. Our policies restrict access to Personal Information to those employees and service providers who need to know the information in order to provide you this service. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may change this privacy policy at any time by posting an updated privacy policy to the site. Changes will be effective when you accept the updated privacy policy or 30 days after the “Last Updated” date in the updated privacy policy, whichever comes first. If you don't affirmatively accept the updated privacy policy, your use of V.me after the 30 day posting period means you are subject to the updated privacy policy.</p>
<h2>How to contact Visa regarding your privacy concerns and questions</h2>
