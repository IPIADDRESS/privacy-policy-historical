<h2>How you can access and edit your Personal Information</h2>

<h2>How we protect your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Visa uses firewalls and Secure Socket Layers to help protect the Personal Information we collect from you when it is being communicated to us.  Our policies restrict access to Personal Information to those employees and service providers who need to know the information in order to provide you this service. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may change this privacy policy at any time by posting an updated privacy policy to the site.  Changes will be effective when you accept the updated privacy policy or 30 days after the “Last Updated” date in the updated privacy policy, whichever comes first.  If you don't affirmatively accept the updated privacy policy, your use of V.me after the 30 day posting period means you are subject to the updated privacy policy.</p>
