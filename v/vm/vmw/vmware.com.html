		<a name="gen"></a><h4>General Information</h4>
		<p>EMC respects the privacy of our customers, business partners and
		employees. We recognize the need for appropriate protections and
		management of your personal information that you provide to
		us. EMC has therefore established this Privacy Statement to assist
		you to understand what information we collect and how that
		information is used. This Privacy Statement applies to EMC
		Corporation including its Divisions and Subsidiaries.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="harbor"></a><h4>Safe Harbor Compliance</h4>
		<p>EMC's privacy practices are in compliance with the U.S. and
		E.U. Safe Harbor principles.  Information about the
		U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor certification can be found
		at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="personal"></a><h4>What personal information does EMC collect?</h4>
		<p>Personal Information is information that can be used to identify or
		contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone
		number or email address.  EMC may collect certain personal
		information from customers, business partners, employees and
		candidates for employment. EMC does not collect personal information
		when you visit EMC's web sites unless you choose to provide such
		personal information.</p>

		<p>On EMC web sites you can order products or services, register
		products, request information, subscribe to marketing or support
		materials, register to a secure extranet site to obtain access to
		product information, support, services and training, or apply for
		jobs at EMC. The types of personal information you provide to us on
		these pages may include name, address, phone number, e-mail address,
		user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, credit
		card or other financial information, contact preferences,
		educational and employment background, job interest data and benefit
		choices.</p>

		<p>EMC also collects personal information of its employees (human
		resources data) in connection with administration of its Human
		Resources programs and functions.  These programs and functions
		include compensation and benefit programs, performance appraisals,
		training, business travel, expense and tuition reimbursement,
		identification cards, access to EMC facilities and computer
		networks, employee profiles, internal employee directories, Human
		Resource recordkeeping, and other employment related purposes.  EMC
		employees can go on-line to access their personal profile, job
		related data, compensation and benefit information, to make benefit
		elections and transactions and to make changes to their personal
		information.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="use"></a><h4>How does EMC use personal information?</h4>
		<p>EMC will use personal information to provide customers and business
		partners with information and services and to help us better
		understand your needs and interests. Specifically, we use your
		information to help you complete a transaction or order, to
		communicate with you, to deliver products/services to you, to bill
		you for products/services you purchased, and to provide ongoing
		service and support. Occasionally we may use your information to
		contact you to complete surveys that we use for marketing and
		quality assurance purposes. Personal information collected online
		may be combined with information you provide to EMC through other
		sources such as trade shows or seminars.</p>

		<p>EMC may share your personal information with third parties in
		responding to your requests for products or services or product
		evaluations. Also, we may on occasion allow selected partners to
		send you special offers in blind mailings. Generally, you will be
		given the opportunity to opt out of having your personal information
		shared with these third parties. However, if you request information
		on any of our products/services, EMC may provide your information to
		third party distributors and resellers who may subsequently contact
		you directly to purchase such products/services. In these instances,
		you will not have the opportunity to opt out of having your
		information shared with these third party distributors and
		resellers.</p>

		<p>Some of EMC's websites make on-line newsgroups available to our
		users. Any information that is disclosed in these newsgroups becomes
		public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to
		disclose your personal information. EMC may, from time to time, send
		email regarding our products and services to users who have posted
		to our newsgroups. Each participant's opinion expressed in a
		newsgroup is his or her own and should not be considered as
		reflecting the opinion of EMC.</p>

		<p>To the extent that EMC uses personal information to email you about
		our product and services, EMC's email practices are in compliance
		with the U.S. and E.U. SPAM laws.  Information about the U.S. and
		E.U. SPAM laws can be found at <a href="http://www.spamlaws.com/" target="_blank">http://www.spamlaws.com/</a>.</p>

		<p>EMC uses personal information to consider candidates for employment
		opportunities within EMC. EMC uses personal information about its
		employees in connection with the administration of its Human
		Resources programs and functions and for purpose of communicating
		with its employees.</p>

		<p>Except as provided in this Statement, EMC does not use your personal
		information for a purpose other than the stated purpose for which
		such information is collected.</p>

		<p>Personal information given to EMC may be transferred across state
		and country borders for data consolidation, storage and simplified
		information management.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="share"></a><h4>With whom does EMC share personal information?</h4>
		<p>EMC contracts with third party service providers and suppliers to
		deliver complete products, services and customer solutions.  EMC may
		share personal information with its service providers and suppliers
		for the sole purpose and only to the extent needed to support the
		customers' business needs.  Service providers and suppliers are
		required to keep confidential the personal information received from
		EMC and may not use it for any purpose other than as originally
		intended.</p>

		<p>Human Resources data may be shared with third party vendors for the
		exclusive purpose of enabling the vendor to provide service and/or
		support to EMC in connection with these Human Resource programs and
		functions. Personal data is not shared with third parties for
		non-employment related purposes.</p>

		<p>Third parties receiving personal information are expected to apply
		the same level of privacy protection as contained in this Privacy
		Statement.</p>

		<p>Except as provided above, EMC will not share personal information
		with any other third parties without your permission, unless
		required by, or in connection with, law enforcement action, subpoena
		or other litigation, or applicable law.</p>

		<p>EMC will not sell, trade or lease your personal information to others.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="choice"></a><h4>Choice &amp; Consent</h4>
		<p>EMC does not require that you provide EMC with personal information.
		The decision to provide personal information is voluntary.  If you
		do not wish to provide the personal information requested, however,
		you may not be able to proceed with the activity or receive the
		benefit for which the personal information is being requested.</p>

		<p>Except as expressly stated otherwise in this Privacy Statement, you
		may opt out of having EMC share personal information with third
		parties as described in this Privacy Statement by notifying EMC in
		writing of your desire to do so.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="sensitive"></a><h4>Sensitive Information</h4>
		<p>Sensitive information is defined as personal information specifying
		medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political
		opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union
		membership, or information specifying the sex life of the
		individual.</p>

		<p>Except as provided below, EMC does not request or receive sensitive
		information from visitors to our web sites.  EMC may receive
		sensitive information such as medical or health conditions, or race
		and ethnic data regarding its employees in connection with the
		administration of its health and welfare benefit plans, or as part
		of government mandated recordkeeping requirements.  Such information
		will not be shared with third parties without the employee's
		affirmative approval as required by applicable law. In addition,
		sensitive information will not be used for a purpose other than its
		original purpose without the employee's approval.  Further, EMC will
		treat as sensitive any information received from a third party where
		the third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="access"></a><h4>Access to and accuracy of your information</h4>
		<p>EMC strives to keep your personal information accurate. We have
		implemented technology, management processes and policies to
		maintain data accuracy. We will provide you with access to your
		information, including making reasonable effort to provide you with
		online access and the opportunity to change your information. To
		protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable
		steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID,
		before granting access to your data.</p>

		<p>EMC will not process personal information in a way that is
		incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or
		subsequently authorized by the individual, as required by applicable
		law.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="security"></a><h4>Security of Personal Information</h4>
		<p>EMC is committed to taking reasonable efforts to secure the personal
		data you choose to provide us. To protect the privacy of any
		personal information you may have provided, EMC employs
		industry-standard controls including physical access controls,
		Internet firewalls, intrusion detection, and network monitoring. In
		addition, access to sensitive data as defined in this Statement is
		limited to those individuals and agents having a need to know.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="other"></a><h4>Other Information/Logging and Cookies</h4>
		<p>EMC collects and/or logs Internet Protocol addresses, Internet
		domain names, the web browser and operating system used to access
		the EMC web site, the files visited, the time spent in each file,
		and the time and date of each visit.</p>

		<p>EMC also uses cookies on some of its web sites. Cookies are
		identifiers that can be sent from a web site via your browser to be
		placed on your computers hard drive. Thereafter when you visit a web
		site, a message is sent back to the web server by the browser
		accessing the web site. You may elect not to accept cookies by
		changing the designated settings on your web browser. However, not
		utilizing cookies may prevent you from using certain functions and
		features of web sites. The information collected from the use of
		cookies is used and analyzed to improve EMC's web sites.</p>

		<p>You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie,
		giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. The
		information we collect and analyze is used to improve our service to
		you and personalize your web-browsing experience.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="links"></a><h4>Links to Non-EMC Web Sites and Third Parties</h4>
		<p>The EMC web sites may provide links to third-party web sites for
		your convenience and information. If you access those links, you
		will leave the EMC web site. EMC does not control those sites or
		their privacy practices, which may differ from EMC's. We do not
		endorse or make any representations about third party web sites. The
		personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not
		covered by the EMC Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the
		privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal
		information. Some third party companies may choose to share their
		personal data with EMC; that sharing is governed by that third party
		company's privacy policy.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="verify"></a><h4>Verification</h4>
		<p>EMC will engage in periodic self-assessment to verify that it
		continues to be in compliance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="contact"></a><h4>Contact Information</h4>
		<p>If you have any questions regarding the Privacy Statement or believe
		that the privacy of your personal information has not been
		respected, you may submit a complaint in writing to the attention of
		EMC's Office of the General Counsel, 176 South Street, Hopkinton, MA
		01748.</p>
		<hr>

		<a name="dispute"></a><h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
		<p>If an employee living in an E.U. member country has a complaint
		regarding the transfer of human resources data to the U.S., EMC
		agrees to cooperate with the appropriate European data protection
		authority for handling such complaints. EMC agrees to handle all
		other disputes involving the transfer of personal data from the EU
		to the U.S. in accordance with the JAMS dispute resolution
		procedures.</p>

		<p>Except as provided above, dispute resolution for all other
		individuals shall be in accordance with applicable law.</p>
		<hr>
