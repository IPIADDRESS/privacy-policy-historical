    <b><a name="what">What personal information does VMware collect
    from me?</a></b><br>
    Personal information is information that can be used to identify
    or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address,
    telephone number or e-mail address. VMware collects personal
    information in several ways from different parts of our Web site.

    <p></p>

    On our Web site, you can order products or services, access
    support services, download evaluation products, request
    information or register VMware products.  In connection with these
    and other uses of our Web site, VMware may collect your personal
    information, such as contact information and financial
    information.  If you contact VMware we may keep a record of that
    correspondence.

    <p></p>

    Please be aware that our Web site may contain links to VMware
    partner or other Web sites.  Those Web sites may collect
    personally identifiable information about you. VMware is not
    responsible for the privacy practices or content of those Web
    sites.

    <p><br></p>

    <b><a name="cookies">What are cookies and how does VMware use
    them?</a></b><br>

    VMware uses <a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/cookie.htm" target="_blank">cookies</a> to store and sometimes track
    information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is
    sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your
    computer's hard drive. All areas of the VMware site where you are
    prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you
    accept cookies. (See <a href="#choice">"What are my choices
    regarding collection, use and distribution of my
    information?"</a> for more information on cookies.)

    <p></p>

    Generally, we use cookies to:

    <ul>

    <li>Remind us of who you are and to access your account
    information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a
    better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you
    register or sign in and is modified when you sign out of our site.

    <p></p>

    </li><li>Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of VMware's Web
    site you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the
    aggregate. We may use this information to better personalize the
    content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see
    on our site.

  </li></ul>

  <p></p>

  VMware also collects <a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html" target="_blank">IP addresses</a> for system administration.

  <p><br></p>

  <b><a name="how">How does VMware use my personal
  information?</a></b><br>
  VMware uses your personal information to provide you with products
  and services, to better understand your needs and interests and to
  facilitate your use of and purchases from the VMware Store.  If you
  request something from our Web site, for example a product or
  service, a product evaluation, or support services, we will use the
  information you provide to fulfill your request.  In connection with
  product and service purchases, contact information is used to ship
  products to you and financial information is used to bill you for
  those products and services.  Occasionally we may use your
  information to contact you to complete surveys that we use for
  marketing purposes.

  <p></p>

  VMware conducts research on our users' demographics, interests, and
  behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration,
  during a promotion, from our server log files, or from surveys. We
  do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is
  compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.

  <p></p>

  Personal information collected online may also be combined with
  information you provide to VMware through other sources such as
  trade shows or seminars.

  <p><br></p>

  <b><a name="share">With whom does VMware share my
  information?</a></b><br>
  VMware will not sell or rent your personal information to others.
  VMware may share your personal information with third parties in
  responding to your requests for products or services or product
  evaluations.  Also, we may on occasion allow selected partners to
  send you special offers in blind mailings.  Generally, you will be
  given the opportunity to opt out of having your personal information
  shared with these third parties.  However, if you request or
  download an evaluation copy of any of our products, VMware may
  provide your information to third party distributors and resellers
  who may subsequently contact you directly to purchase VMware
  products or services.  In connection with these requests for
  evaluation copies of VMware products, you will not have the
  opportunity to opt out of having your information shared with these
  third party distributors and resellers.

  <p></p>

  Any user statistics that we may provide partners regarding VMware
  product or service usage are provided in the aggregate only and do
  not include any personally identifiable information about any
  individual user.

  <p></p>

  VMware could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or
  some or all of its assets could be acquired.  Such a transaction may
  involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or
  actual purchasers.  VMware's intent is to seek appropriate
  protection for personal information in these types of transactions.

  <p><br></p>

  <b><a name="choice">What are my choices regarding collection, use,
  and distribution of my information?</a></b><br>

  VMware may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products
  and services. Only VMware (or agents working on behalf of VMware and
  under confidentiality agreements) or VMware distributors or
  resellers will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to
  receive such mailings, tell us when you give us your personal
  information. Or, at any time, you can edit your <a href="https://www.vmware.com/vmwarestore/newstore/login.jsp">VMware
  account information</a> to no longer receive such offers and
  mailings. You will need your VMware ID and password in order to
  access your <a href="https://www.vmware.com/vmwarestore/newstore/login.jsp">VMware
  account information</a>.

  <p></p>

  You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your
  browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to
  be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.

  <p><br></p>

  <b><a name="update">What is VMware's policy on allowing me to
  update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable
  information?</a></b><br>

  You may edit your <a href="https://www.vmware.com/vmwarestore/newstore/login.jsp">VMware
  account information</a> at any time by using your VMware ID and
  password. If you have forgotten your password, please <a href="https://www.vmware.com/vmwarestore/newstore/forgot_password.jsp">click
  here to retrieve your password</a>.

  <p><br></p>

  <b><a name="protect">How does VMware protect my
  information?</a></b><br>

  Keeping your information private is very important to us.

  <p></p>

  Please note that there are several places on the VMware Web site
  where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete
  a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. By default, any
  time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card
  number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure
  socket layer) encryption. If you are not able to use SSL encryption,
  VMware offers you the option of providing this information in other
  ways, including by fax and over a non-secure Web connection.

  <p><br></p>

  <b><a name="newsgroups">How can I protect my privacy on the VMware
  newsgroups?</a></b><br>
  VMware makes <a href="/support/using/newsgroups.html">newsgroups</a>
  available to its users. Please remember that any information that is
  disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should
  exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal
  information. VMware may, from time to time, send email regarding our
  products and services to users who have posted to our newsgroups.
  Each participant's opinion expressed in a newsgroup is his or her
  own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of
  VMware. 

  <p><br></p>

  <b><a name="changes">Can this privacy policy change?</a></b><br>
  VMware may revise this privacy policy.  This privacy policy was last
  updated on February 4, 2003.  If there are updates to the terms of
  this privacy policy, we will post the revised policy and update the
  revision date in this paragraph.  For material changes to this
  privacy policy, VMware will provide notification to affected
  customers.  Please review this policy periodically to be apprised of
  any updates. </span></span></td>
