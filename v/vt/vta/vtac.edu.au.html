<p>Consistent with its obligations under the&nbsp;<em>Information Privacy Act 2000 (Vic)</em><em> </em>and  principles outlined in the&nbsp;<em>National Privacy Policy  Principles 2001</em>, VTAC has a Code of Privacy and Ethics to ensure  that any information provided, including identification of individuals, will be  used only for the purpose(s) intended. Where the intention includes  confidentiality, information will be treated as such unless otherwise required  by law.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement explains how your personal  information (being information capable of identifying you as an individual)  will be treated by VTAC.</p>
<p>The institutions that participate in VTAC are committed to  observing the VTAC Code of Privacy and Ethics. This code is designed to protect  the rights of you, the applicant, institutions and the Victorian Tertiary  Admissions Centre (VTAC).</p>
<h2>Associate institutions</h2>
<p>An Associate institution is an institution that lists all of  their courses in the VTAC Guide as ‘Direct to the institution’ and manages the  application and offer process directly with the applicant.</p>
<p>As a result, all data provided by you, as part of your  direct application to one of these institutions should be in accordance with  that institution’s obligations under the&nbsp;<em>Information Privacy Act 2000  (Vic)</em><em> </em>and  principles outlined in the&nbsp;<em>National Privacy Principles  2001.</em></p>
<p><em>For further information about how  your information is handled when you apply directly to one of these  institutions, refer to each institution’s website for a copy of their privacy policy.</em></p>
<h2>VTAC institutions</h2>
<h3>What  VTAC collects and why</h3>
<h4>All applicants</h4>
<p>The information we collect will include contact details,  personal details, residential status, current or previous results for  Australian Year 12 studies, the Victorian General Achievement Test (GAT),  tertiary studies and any other tests required by participating institutions as  part of their selection process.</p>
<p>To assist institutions with enrolments VTAC will also  collect information about languages spoken at home, place of birth and  ethnicity. Your responses are not used as part of the selection process but  rather for the collection of governmental statistics.</p>
<p>On behalf of VTAC institutions we ask that you indicate  whether or not you have a disability. The choice to answer this question is  optional and your response is not used as part of the selection process, but  rather to ensure that you have adequate access to support services.</p>
<p>Once you have applied we will endeavour to obtain any  current or previous results for Australian Year 12 studies, the General  Achievement Test (GAT), tertiary studies and any other tests required by VTAC  institutions as part of their selection process directly from the respective  state databases, university or testing centres.</p>
<p>With regard to university results, a Grade Point Average  (GPA) is calculated:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you undertake university studies in Australia  and</li>
<li>if VTAC has been able to access the results  electronically via the Automated Results Transfer Scheme (ARTS).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Current Year 12 students</strong></p>
<p>In order to establish and maintain the  VTAC applicant file and VTAC CourseLink (web based course information and  counselling program), we collect personal information from the Victorian  Curriculum and Assessment Authority and its interstate equivalents on:</p>
<ul>
<li>students undertaking one or more VCE units of study  (or interstate equivalent) </li>
<li>students undertaking one or more Senior VCAL units  of study </li>
<li>International Baccalaureate (IB) students (studying the IB with an  Australian school). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What information is used?</strong></p>
<p>We will limit use of your personal  information to carrying out business which includes confirming the data  contained within your application, confirming past and/or current results,  distributing your application to the institutions and courses to which you have  applied (through VTAC), notifying you of cancelled courses, change of  preference and offers.</p>
<p>Using the results received from  the VCAA, VTAC calculates an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) for  tertiary entrance for eligible VCE students and a notional ATAR for Victorian  IB students.</p>
<p>While current and previous Year 12  results are stored on a national database, this information can only be  accessed, by the Director (or nominee) of any state-based tertiary admission  centre if you initiate an application with that centre for tertiary study  within that state.</p>
<p>The Grade Point Average (GPA) will  be used as stated under each published course or institutional selection mode.  Refer to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wss9.vtac.edu.au/current/grade-point-averages.html">GPA</a> for further information.</p>
<h3>Who has access to your information?</h3>
<h4>All applicants</h4>
<p>We distribute your personal information to institutions to  which you have applied for the purpose of application, Special Entry Access  Schemes, Scholarships and selection only. Institutions are not permitted to  share, sell or trade your information without your express permission.</p>
<p>We will not share, sell or trade your personal information  to any institution to which you have not applied.</p>
<p>We may use your information to conduct research; however at  no time is personal or sensitive data made available to any person or authority  outside of VTAC and its governmental responsibilities without your permission.</p>
<p>We do allow your information to be provided to other  organisations that perform certain functions or operations for us. We bind  these companies to the same privacy requirements as we do ourselves so that  they cannot provide this information to anyone else.</p>
<p>We enforce these requirements through contractual  agreements.</p>
<h4>Current Year 12 Students</h4>
<p>As the year progresses, VTAC will distribute your course  preference data, ATAR (Victorian schools only), offer and enrolment details to  your school for the purposes of counselling and the development of generic  student reports.</p>
<p>If you are studying in Victoria and have been allocated an  ATAR, VTAC will distribute your ATAR to the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment  Authority to assist them in confirming the Premiers Awards.</p>
