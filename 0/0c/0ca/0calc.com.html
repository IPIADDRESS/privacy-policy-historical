July 2018</small></h1>The protection of our users' personal information is important to us. You can expect us to handle your data sensitively and carefully and to ensure a high level of data security. We naturally observe the provisions of the Federal Data Protection Act (German "BDSG") and the Telemedia Act (German "TMG"), the General Data Protection Regulation (Europe "GDPR", German "DS-GVO") 2016/679 and will only collect and process personal user data to the extent described in this data protection declaration.
<h2>Responsible Entity</h2>Responsible entity in the sense of § 3 para. 7 Federal Data Protection Act (German "BDSG") and service provider in the sense of § 13 German Telemediengesetz ("TMG") is: <i>(hereinafter referred to as "we" or "us)</i><br><br><blockquote>Andre Massow<br>Arminiusstr. 17<br>33100 Paderborn<br>Germany <br><br>britnex+privacypolicy@gmail.com<br>05251892396<br></blockquote>You can find further details about the responsible body in our imprint.
<br><br><h2>Data Protection Officer</h2>The appointment of a data protection officer is not necessary for us, because the criteria for the necessity specified by the DS-GVO are currently not given. For contact, see our <i>Responsible Entity</i>.
<br><br><h1>Personal information, purposes and legal basis of data processing</h1><h2>Rights Affected</h2><blockquote>The basic data protection regulation guarantees you certain rights which you can assert against us - insofar as the legal requirements are met.

This includes information such as your real name, address, postal address, telephone number and email address. Information that is not directly associated with your real identity (such as favorite websites or the number of users of a site) is not included.
The IP address can also be a personal date. An IP address is assigned to each device connected to the Internet by the Internet provider so that it can send and receive data.
<br><br><strong>You can use our online offer without disclosing your identity. </strong><br><br>Some functions of this website require the collection and processing of the following personal information:
<ol><li><strong>Email Address</strong><ul><li>We recommend that you create your own new email address for this website, where the address does not allow any inference to your person!
</li><li>Your email address will not be used for marketing purposes and will not be passed on to third parties.
</li><li>Stored email addresses are not displayed to other website users and can only be accessed by a few specially authorized persons who are responsible for maintaining the servers and the forum.
</li><li>We use your email address only for the following purposes:
<ol><li>At the end of the registration process an email with a registration confirmation link will be sent. Note: After successful registration you can update your email address under "My Profile" with an empty string and remove it from our database.
</li><li>If you have forgotten your password, you can receive a link to reset your password by email.
</li><li>If you create a question in the discussion forum, you can enter your email address to receive a notification email after your question was answered. Input of your email is voluntary and not necessary for the creation of your question.
</li></ol></li></ul></li></ol><br>The legal basis for such processing is Article 6 Abs. 1 lit. b) DS-GVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the aforementioned purpose.
<br>Storage period: We store personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes listed above. Art. 5 para. 1 lit. e) DS-GVO.

</li></ul></li><li><strong>User image / Avatar image</strong><ul><li>Select a picture here that does not allow any conclusion on your identity. Never use a personal photo here!
</li></ul></li><li><strong>Posts in the forum and message center</strong><ul><li>Never enter personal information, even if requested by other forum users!
</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><h2>Contact by E-mail</h2><blockquote>If you contact us by e-mail, we will at least process your e-mail address and any other personal information contained in the e-mail. This happens exclusively to answer your inquiry.

<br>You have to expect that your contributions will be recorded in search engines and will be accessible worldwide even without a specific call to our website.
Deletion or correction of such entries often cannot be enforced by foreign operators. Furthermore, there is no claim to deletion of this non-personal information vis-à-vis us as website operator.
</blockquote><h2>Cancel User Account</h2><blockquote>You can cancel your account at any time. To do this, use the Message Center to send an informal message to the user "admin" with your deletion request.
</blockquote><h2>Receiver of Data</h2><blockquote>We store your data on specially protected servers. Only a few specially authorised persons who are involved in the technical support of the servers have access to them.
<br>The data you enter is transmitted between your web browser and our servers in encrypted form. (SSL or TLS encryption).
</blockquote><h2>Order Data Processing</h2><blockquote>Should data be passed on to service providers within the scope of order data processing, they are bound to the BDSG, other legal regulations and contractually to this Privacy Policy.
Insofar as we are legally or by court order obliged to do so, we will transfer your data to bodies entitled to receive information.
