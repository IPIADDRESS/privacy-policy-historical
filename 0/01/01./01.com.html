It's important to 01.com to help our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.

														<p id="standard">When you place orders or access your personal account information, you're utilizing a secure server using 256-bit SSL, which encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies available.</p>
														<p id="standard">In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

If your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from purchases made from us over our secure server.

Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.</p><p id="standard">When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal identification number, then send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours.

We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer, when those services may impact service, such as with upgrades and new features about which you may want to know. When you order from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. For your convenience, we do save billing information to bill you for any recurring services you may have ordered, and in case you want to order from us again, and we don't use this information again without your permission.</p>
														<p id="standard">01.com will disclose your personal information, without notice,  if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on 01.com or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of 01.com and its family of Websites,  (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of customers of 01.com, its Websites, or the public, and, (d) conform to the policies of your organization in the case in which your organization is a client in good-standing of 01.com.</p></td>
