                <p>Information Collection and Use                       Information Collection<br>

                </p>

                <p>US  Home Base Business is the sole owner of the information collected from  the Member for use of the 10aMonth.com System. 10aMonth.com  collects information from our on several pages throughout our website.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Registration:</strong></p>

                <p> A Members is required to register in order to use the 10aMonth.com  System. During registration the Member is required to give contact  information (such as name and email address).

                </p>

                <p>We  request information from the Member on our order form when registering  a new account. A Member must provide contact information (such as name,  email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit  card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing  purposes. In addition, this information may be given to the network  marketing company for the purpose of tracking and measuring success of  the system.

                </p>

                <p><strong>Information Use:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>We  will use personal information that we gather about you to provide the  services that you have requested. In addition, we will use the  information you have supplied to encourage you to buy the products and  services offered by our company.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Profile:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>We  store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear  gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile  is stored information that we keep on individual users that details  their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied  to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and  improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to  tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent  marketing promotions to them. We do share your profile with other third  parties. Your profile is shared together with your personally  identifiable information. YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION, SOCIAL SECURITY OR  EIN NUMBER IS NEVER SHARED FOR ANY REASON WITH ANY OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY  UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, EXCEPT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENROLLMENT IN OUR MLM  OPPORTUNITES.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Cookies:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>A  cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to  information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and  persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the  browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small  text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of  time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser  help file directions.</p>

                <p>By  setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password  more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject  the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is  that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Persistent  cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to  enhance the experience on our site. See the “Profile” section.</p>

                <p>Some  of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example,  advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these  cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for  advertising.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Log Files:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>Like  most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet  protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),  referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of  clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in  the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate  use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable  information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable  information to enable our Web-based service.</p>

                <p> Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)<br>

                We employ [or our third party advertising company employs] a software  technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help  us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is  effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,  similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online  movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that  clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the  size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to  users’ personally identifiable information.</p>

                <p>Clear  Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both  from the same Web site or advertising company. That means, for example,  that if a person visited “www.companyX.com”, which uses an advertising  company's clear gif, the Web site or advertising company would match  the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID  number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This  collected information would then be given to the advertising company or  Web site.<br>

                In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails  to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This  allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the  effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to  opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.</p>

                <p><strong>Communications from the Site                       Special Offers and Updates</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>We  send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username.  Established members will occasionally receive information on products,  services, special deals, and a newsletter.<br>

                  Newsletter<br>

                </p>

                <p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Service Announcements:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>On  rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related  announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for  maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not  opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their  account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Customer Service:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>We  communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services  and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email  or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.</p>

                <p><strong>Sharing                       Legal Disclaimer:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>Though  we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose  personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith  belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial  proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.<br>

                </p>

                <p>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)<br>

                  We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and  advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable  information.<br>

                </p>

                <p>Third Party AdvertisersParties:<br>

                We use the information you have voluntarily provided to cause  information, offers, products, and/or services that appear to us to be  consistent with your expressed interests to be directed to you. This is  typically accomplished by using your information to direct to you  information, offers, products, and/or services from us and/or one of  our affiliated companies. Your information may, therefore, ultimately  be used for marketing purposes by us, our affiliated companies, and/or  any one or more the associated businesses with which we work.</p>

                <p>We  cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other  personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not  otherwise described in this Privacy Statement. For example, we may be  forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under  certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or  access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you  authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement  or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe  necessary or appropriate.</p>

                <p>After  we share your information with our affiliated companies and/or any of  the several businesses with which we work, we lose control over how  they will use, collect, and/or disseminate your information.  Accordingly, we recommend that you review the Privacy Statements of the  corresponding affiliated companies with whom we have shared your  information in order to acquaint yourself with their information  collection, use, and/or sharing policies.<br>

                </p>

                <p>You  understand and agree that US Home Base Business is not responsible for  the privacy practices or the content of these other websites, and you  agree that US Home Base Business is not responsible for how such  information is ultimately used.</p>

                <p><strong>These are the instances in which we will share users’ personal information:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>We  Share Personal Contact Information with third parties. If you want to  ensure that your information is never shared with any third party, you  must request to be unsubscribed or cancelled from our service. Failure  to unsubscribe or cancel your service will imply that you are  interested in having your personal information shared with various  third parties.</p>

                <p><strong>Third Party Intermediaries:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>We  use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card  processing company to bill users for goods and services. These  companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable  information for any secondary purposes.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Service Providers:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>We  partner with other third parties to provide specific services. When the  user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or other  contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide  these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally  identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these  services and for purposes referenced in their privacy policies.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Business Transitions:</strong></p>

                <p> In the event 10aMonth.com goes through a business transition, such as  a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of  its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be  part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email prior  to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If  as a result of the business transition, the users’ personally  identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that  stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent  with our notification of changes section.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Choice/Opt-out:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>Our  users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their  information used for purposes not directly related to our site only by  completely opting-out of our service and/or canceling a paid  subscription to our service.</p>

                <p>Users  who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional  communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by  following the unsubscribe instructions sent with every email.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Links:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>This  Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we,  10aMonth.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such  other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our  site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that  collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement  applies solely to information collected by this Web site.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Security:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>This  Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When  users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information  is protected both online and off-line.</p>

                <p>When  our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information  (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that  information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption  software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our  order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as  Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as  opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.</p>

                <p>While  we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also  do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of  our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned  above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the  information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk  or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally  identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected  screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must  re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and  privacy practices. Every [quarter], as well as any time new policies  are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the  importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our  users’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that store  personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a  secure facility.</p>

                <p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can contact us at <a href="http://support.ushbb.com">SUPPORT</a></p>

                <p>Supplementation of Information</p>

                <p> In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users  it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with  information from 3rd party sources.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Enhancement of Marketing Profile:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>We  purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user  database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers  we think our users would be interested in. We use this information to  enhance or overlay the ‘profile’ of individual users. This aggregate  marketing data is therefore tied to the users’ personally identifiable  information. See also the “Profile.”<br>

                  Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information<br>

                  If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip  code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires  our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate  users’ personally identifiable information. This can be done in the  Member Back Office.<br>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Notification of Changes:</strong><br>

                </p>

                <p>If  we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to  this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem  appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we  collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we  disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy  policy under which the information was collected.</p>

                <p>If,  however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information  in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we  will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or  not we use their information in this different manner. However, if  users have opted out of all communication with the site, or  deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor  will their personal information be used in this new manner. In  addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that  do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will  post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change.  In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have  opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes  in our privacy practices.<br>
