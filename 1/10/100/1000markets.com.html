<h1><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Privacy Policy<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">Effective Date: August 29, 2008</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At 1000 Markets, Inc., we care about how your personal
information is used and shared. We respect your right to privacy and we
recognize that visitors to http://www.1000markets.com (“<b><i>Site</i></b>”) need
to understand and control the uses of their personal information. On our Site
you may browse and purchase products from our merchants, you may express
yourself and participate in the community, and, if you are a merchant, you may
display, sell and promote your products and your business. The privacy policy
below describes the measures taken by us to protect your privacy in connection
with your use of our Site. </p>

<h2><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">WHAT PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT, AND WHEN DO WE COLLECT IT? <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">We receive and store any information you enter on our Site
or otherwise provide to us, including information that is generated by your
activities on our Site. We use the information that you provide for such
purposes as opening your account, processing your orders, responding to your
requests, communicating with you, and customizing your experience. We also let
you provide optional information in order to express yourself on the Site.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here are the types of information we <a name="collect"></a>collect:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><span class="GramE"><b>Registration</b>.</span> If you choose, you may become a
registered user by creating an account with us. When you create an account, we
require that you supply a user name, password, and e-mail address. If you wish
to become a merchant and sell products, you may be asked to provide additional
information related to you and your business, such as your business name.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>Purchases</b>.</span> If you decide to
purchase products from a merchant on our Site or from us, you must be a
registered user. If you go through the checkout process without specifying an
existing registered account, we will ask you for an email address and create an
account on your behalf (in which case, we will send a computer-generated user
name and password to the email address you supply). When you make a purchase,
you may be also asked to provide information necessary to fulfill the order,
such as contact information and a shipping address. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>Payment Processing</b>.</span> In order
to send or receive payments, or access additional services, you are required to
have an account with our third-party payment service provider, Amazon Payments,
Inc., which may request additional information such as your full name, billing
address, and banking or credit card information.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"> </span>Their
use of such information is subject to their own privacy policies and applicable
law. For more information, you may review the <a href="https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/about?nodeId=6020">Amazon Payments
Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span class="GramE"><b>Forms</b>.</span>
We use various forms for listing, selling, purchasing and returning products or
services offered on our Site. We may use these forms, for instance, to collect
your contact information (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., your user name, e-mail address,
mailing address and/or telephone number) in order to facilitate the sale and to
provide our registered users with a means to get in touch with one another when
deemed necessary. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><span class="GramE"><b>Surveys, Special Contests or Promotions</b>.</span> We may
occasionally present a survey, special contest or promotion that is sponsored
by 1000 Markets or by another company. To participate in such survey, contest
or promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to
share your personal information with the sponsor(s) or with others, we will
provide a statement to that effect in the survey, contest or promotion terms.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>User Content.</b></span><b> </b>You may
elect to contribute content to the Site including forum postings, blog entries,
personal photos, videos, and other content that you own or have the right to
display and reproduce. Providing such information is optional. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>User Home Page.</b></span> Every
registered user has a home page that is accessible by anyone who uses the Site
(a “<b>User Home Page</b>”). Your User Home Page is how you present yourself to
the community. Some of the information on your User Home Page is provided by
you and some is generated automatically by your activities on the Site. As a
registered user, you may update your User Home Page and adjust its privacy
settings. If you are a merchant selling on our Site, then your shop home page
incorporates your User Home Page.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><span class="GramE"><b>Feedback</b>.</span> We may ask you for feedback on other users
with whom you have had transactions. Providing feedback is optional.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>Computer and Connection Information</b>.</span>
We collect and analyze information provided to us by your computer (or other
internet-enabled device) when you connect to and use our Site, such as browser
type and version, operating system, and platform. We also collect and store
your IP Address. An Internet Protocol (“<b><i>IP</i></b>”) address is a unique
string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service
Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to
administer our Site. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad
demographic information.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>Cookies</b>.</span> A “cookie” is a
small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain
websites. We may use cookies supplied by your browser or by third-party
add-ins, such as Flash. We use cookies to collect, store and sometimes track
information for statistical purposes to improve the services we provide. We
also use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and
personalized services (including, without limitation to hold your shopping cart
information). These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your
personally identifiable information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit
other websites you may be required to accept cookies. Advertisers and partners
may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and
expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>URL Click Steam</b>.</span> We may
collect the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) click-stream to, through, and
from our Site, including any time and date information associated with it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>Page Interactions</b>.</span> We may
use software tools such as Flash or JavaScript to collect page interaction
information (clicks, drags, hover-<span class="SpellE">overs</span>) as well as
information about page response times, errors, and length of visits to certain
pages.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</b>. Clear gifs are
tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In
contrast to cookies, which are placed on a user’s hard drive, clear gifs are
embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear gifs to track information for
statistical purposes to improve the services we provide. Our use of clear gifs
will not enable third parties to access any of your personally identifiable
information. Additionally, be aware that advertisers and partners may also use
their own clear gifs. We do not control use of these and expressly disclaim
responsibility for information collected through them.</p>

<h2><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">HOW DO WE USE YOUR
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION? <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>Order processing</b>.</span> As part of
the transaction process, we will pass along certain personally identifiable
information to either the buyer or the seller, as the case may be, and to
certain third-party service providers. Such information may only be used to
process the transaction and to ship your purchases to or from you, as the case
may be. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>Customized experience</b>.</span> We
gather your personally identifiable information to provide you with a
customized experience on our Site. Your personally identifiable information
helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current
and future needs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>E-mail; Physical Mailings</b>.</span>
If you register with our Site, from time to time, we may send you e-mail
messages or postal mail informing you of our products and services and also
third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as
new features and services, special offers and updated information. The e-mails
we <span class="GramE">send &nbsp;may</span> contain code that enables our
database to track your usage of the e-mail, including whether the e-mail was
opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine such
information with other information we have about you and may use this
information to improve your experience with our Site and/or provide customized
e-mail communications to you. We may use third-party service providers to
process our emails and we may pass along certain personally identifiable
information to them. Such information may only be used to process the emails.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b>History</b>.</span> We may maintain
records of your selling and purchasing activities on the Site.&nbsp; Merchants
may access historical order records showing transaction between them and buyers
who purchased products from them, such records may include all information from
the original order including user name, shipping address, products purchased,
and payment amounts.</p>

<h2><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">WHO DO WE SHARE
YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH?<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify">If you make
a purchase on the Site, we share certain personal information about you with
the seller to complete the transaction (such as your name, order details and
shipping address). We may also share this information with third parties to
facilitate the order, such as payment processing companies, shipping partners
and sales tax affiliates.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We employ other companies and individuals to perform
functions on our behalf or on behalf of our merchants. Examples include sending
postal mail or e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
processing payment transactions, verifying identity, fraud screening and
providing customer service. These third parties may have access to your
personal information solely as needed to perform their functions.&nbsp; We will
not share your personally identifiable information with third parties (aside
from entities that perform services for us that either are bound to comply with
our privacy policy or have privacy policies that protect your information, or
as described in the following three paragraphs) unless you have “opted-in” to
such sharing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify">However, we
may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have
a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or
with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property;
or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify">We may
gather demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level
or household income) from time to time. We will not share such information with
any other person or entity in a manner that identifies you as an individual,
unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your
permission. When we share demographic information with third parties, we will
give them aggregate information only.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify">As we
develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the
transaction, your personally identifiable information may be one of the
transferred assets. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your
personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring
party. We will notify by notice on the Site of any change of ownership or
control of your personal information.</p>

<h2><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">WHAT ARE YOUR
OPTIONS TO CONTROL THE USE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION? <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify">Although
most users of our Site tell us they value receiving our newsletters, special
promotions and information regarding service provided by others, we recognize
the importance of providing you with choice and control. If you would rather
not receive emails about new services, promotions, or other noteworthy news,
you can change your settings in your user profile or you may contact us at
support@1000markets.com.</p>

<h2><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">HOW CAN I UPDATE MY
PROFILE?<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify">You can help
us maintain the accuracy of your profile by notifying us when you change your
contact information, such as your mailing address or e-mail address. If at any
time you wish to update your information or stop receiving communication from
us, you may go to and update your profile by signing in to your account and
going to the My Account area.</p>

<h2><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">WHAT ABOUT KIDS’
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify">Our Site is
not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume products purchased through
Amazon Payments are purchased by adults or minors supervised by a parent or
guardian. We respect the privacy of parents and children and are committed to
complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<b><i>COPPA</i></b>”).
On those areas of our Site that ask for age, we do not collect personal
information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13
except in those limited circumstances where we believe that such collection is
permitted under COPPA. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify">We may ask
prospective users to provide their age during the registration process and on
other areas of our Site. If a user indicates that he or she is under the age of
13 then all personal data collected during the registration process is
automatically deleted except that we may retain and use limited information,
such as the child’s email address, for a limited period of time, in those cases
where we believe that the collection and use of such information is permitted
under COPPA. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify">If a parent
believes that his or her child has provided us with personal information, he or
she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. We will promptly
delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age
of 13. If we learn that a user of the Site who is under 13 is publicly posting
or sharing personally identifiable information, the user will be blocked from
accessing these areas of the Site.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify">We believe
that parents should supervise their children’s online activities and consider
using parental control tools available from online services and software
manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools
can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address
and other personal information without parental permission. </p>

<h2><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">WHAT ELSE SHOULD
YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY? <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><b>Forums,
Chat Rooms, and Other Areas with User Generated Content. </b>If you use forums,
chat rooms, or other areas of our Site where you post your own content and
participate in the community (including your own User Home Page), you should be
aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be
read, collected or used by other users of the Site, and could be used to send
you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable
information you choose to submit in these areas of the Site.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><span class="GramE"><b>Security</b>.</span> We have security measures in place to
protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of
information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant
the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and we
accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><span class="GramE"><b>Links to Other Sites</b>.</span> Our Site contains hyperlinks
and pointers to Internet sites maintained by third parties. These links are
provided for your reference only. We do not control, operate or endorse in any
respect information, products or services on such third-party sites and are not
responsible for their content. Many third-party sites have their own privacy
policies that differ from ours. This privacy policy only covers our Site and
does not cover any other site. While we make every effort to keep your
information secure, we do not control the policies of other sites.</p>

<h2><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">CHANGES TO THIS
PRIVACY POLICY<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may make changes in our privacy policy from time to time.
When we do so, we will post the revised privacy policy on our Site with a link
at the bottom of our home page. Our home page will also contain a statement
notifying readers that the policy has changed and the effective date of that
