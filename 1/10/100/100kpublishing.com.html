<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">2. Web Site Use
Information</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web
site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and web server
log files to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web
server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web
sites visited just before and just after our Web site.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">How Do We Use the Information That You
Provide to Us?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Broadly speaking, we use personal information
for purposes of administering our business activities, providing the products and services you requested, to
process your payment, , to monitor the use of the service, our marketing and promotional efforts and improve our
content and service offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, services and for other lawful purposes.
These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Furthermore, such information may be shared with
others on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or business information will not be shared with
parties except as required by law.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Occasionally, we may also use the information we
collect to notify you about important changes to our Website, new services, and special offers we think you will
find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at the link
provided on the newsletter.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What Are Cookies?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A cookie is a very small text document, which
often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer
for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site
can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your
browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by
other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you
may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies,
it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie
cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">How Do We Use Information We Collect
from Cookies?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">As you visit and browse our Web site, the site
uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having
to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to
calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This
helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us
to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your
browser provided to us in your cookies.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">IP Addresses</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">IP addresses are used by your computer every
time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to
identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and
profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Sharing and Selling
Information</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the
information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to
the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">How Can You Access and Correct Your
Information?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">You may request access to all your personally
identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at the usual
address.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What About Legally Compelled Disclosure
of Information?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We may disclose information when legally
compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection
of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms
of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our
Web Site?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We are not responsible for the practices
employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the information or content contained therein. Often links
to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our
Web site.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Please remember that when you use a link to go
from our Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on
any other web site, including web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules
and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Your Consent</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">By using our Web site you consent to our
collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend
this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Our Commitment To Data
Security:</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Please note that your information will be stored
and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be
less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain
data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic,
and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that
they will not receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending the particular messages as
soon as technically feasible.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Surveys &amp;
Contests</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">From time-to-time our site requests information
from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user
therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact
information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact
information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of
monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A Special Note About
Children</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Children are not eligible to use our services
unsupervised and we ask that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any personal information to us. If you
are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or
guardians.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Acquisition or Changes in
Ownership</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In the event that the web site (or a substantial
portion of its assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of
those assets that are transferred.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Policy Modifications</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We may change this Privacy Policy from time to
time. If/when changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us permission to do so.
We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the
Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this
Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior
consent</span></p>
