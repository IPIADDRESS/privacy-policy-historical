                    content of your messages. The use of this information will be in accordance with this Mobile Policy. If fees are charged to your 
                    wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier 
                    and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own 
                    policies. You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to 
                    transmit communications over complex networks. We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery 
                    is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis. We do not guarantee 
                    that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may 
                    experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended 
                    use of the SMS Service. You may opt out of the SMS Service at any time by replying "STOP", "END", or "QUIT" to the SMS text message you 
                    have received. This process impacts only the future delivery of the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for
