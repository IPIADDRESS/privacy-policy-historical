<h3>3. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</h3>
<p>
<strong>(a)	Traffic Data.</strong>  Like most website operators,  Blue Global automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website; and (v) full Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") click stream data, including referring URLs, date and time, and content viewed or searched for on the Website (collectively "Traffic Data").  Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>(b)	Cookies.</strong>  A "Cookie" is a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website.  The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website.   Blue Global uses "session" cookies to collect information about your use of the Website and to give you a more personalized browsing experience and help you navigate the Website more efficiently from page to page.

In each case, you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Website will not gather it surreptitiously. BY PROVIDING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, YOU THEREBY EXPRESSLY CONSENT THE COLLECTION BY BLUE GLOBAL OF SUCH INFORMATION.  Blue Global may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies, third-party service providers, etc.) who may lawfully provide such information to Blue Global.
</p>

<p>
<strong>(f) Widgets.</strong> The Website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button.
