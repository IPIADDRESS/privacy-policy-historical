                    <strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong>
                    <br>
                    Beginning January 1, 2005 under California's "Shine the Light" law, California residents who provide personal
                    information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to either: (1)
                    a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided;
                    or (2) to be notified of a mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having their information shared with third
                    parties. <!--We have elected the second option. To opt-out of having your information shared with third parties, 
                    <a href="">click here</a> and follow the opt-out instructions.-->

                    <strong>HOW DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION AND WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong>
                    <br>
                    We collect and combine personally identifiable information ("PII") and non-personally identifiable information
                    ("Non-PII") through various sources, including those discussed below. For your reference, PII is data collected with
                    an intention to specifically identify, contact or locate a person, including but not limited to name, address, telephone
                    number, or e-mail address. Conversely, Non-PII is data that is not used to specifically identify, contact or locate an
                    individual, including but not limited to zip code, gender, age, or IP address.
                    <br>

                    the website publisher partner may submit all or a portion of the information that you submitted on the form to the Company.

                    You may be familiar with the term "cookies," which are unique alphanumeric identifiers that store information on your

                    you can choose through most web browsers to make website visits anonymous. Of course, cookies let you have a more satisfying
                    website experience, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.
                    <br>

                    We also collect information through our web server applications. This information includes your Internet Protocol or "IP"

                    Additionally, we may use pixel tracking technology to track the completion of transactions with us or our advertisers,
                    the source information for those transactions, and your IP address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.

                    <strong>Government Forms</strong>
                    <br>
                    The Company may be required to create, collect, maintain, and submit certain information required by
                    the government, such as IRS Forms W-9 and 1099. This information, which may include your taxpayer identification

                    <strong>HOW DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION?</strong>
                    <br>

                    you submitted to the Company during the website registration process. Additionally, this technology may pre-fill some or
                    all of the offers' data fields with the information you submitted during the website registration process in order to prevent
                    you from having to re-enter this information. We may not show all of the pre-filled data fields to you.

                    We may use your information to operate the website promotion, service your account and to fulfill rewards earned through
                    Company websites. We may also use your information to verify your identity or claimed account status and, where we consider
                    appropriate, investigate your compliance with the terms and conditions of the website promotion or any advertiser offer. We
                    do retain customer service correspondence.

                    We may share your information with various third party vendors that are not part of the Company, including but not limited
                    to vendors that provide us with technology to deploy commercial e-mail, vendors that sell the products or services for which

                    <br>
                    When you participate in an offer by completing a form, we will transfer the information you submitted on the form to the

                    registration process will be transferred to advertisers that we believe may be of interest to you without providing you with

                    <br>
                    We may use third party ad networks or ad serving companies to serve advertisements on our websites. We pass information

                    This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or submitted to the Company. Other affiliated entities
                    of the Company may obtain information independently from transactions and experiences with you or from other sources.

                    <strong>WHAT IS THE POLICY WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNICATING WITH CHILDREN?</strong>
                    <br>
                    We recognize the unique privacy concerns regarding children. We are committed to carefully protecting
                    privacy where children are involved no matter the point of contact. In particular, our intention is to fully

                    PII from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian is made aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided
                    us with PII through any point of contact, please contact us and we will delete the information about the child referenced
                    from our files.
