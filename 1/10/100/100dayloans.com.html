    <p>Please note that, while certain lenders may offer up to 100 days to repay a loan, a 100-day repayment period is atypical. Most consumers can expect a significantly shorter repayment period. 100DayLoans.com encourages you to confirm your loan repayment period with your lender prior to finalizing the loan.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</h3>
    <p><strong>a. Traffic Data.</strong>  Like most website operators, we automatically gather information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website; and (v) full Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") click stream data, including referring URLs, date and time, and content viewed or searched for on the Website (collectively "<span class="underline">Traffic Data</span>").  Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you. </p>

    <p><strong>b. Cookies.</strong>  A "<span class="underline">Cookie</span>" is a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website.  The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website.  We use "session" cookies to collect information about your use of the Website and to give you a more personalized browsing experience and help you navigate the Website more efficiently from page to page. These Cookies are temporary and are deleted when you close your browser. We use "persistent" cookies to gather statistical information about repeat usage from your computer or workstation. For additional information on our uses of Cookies, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies and Web Beacons, below. </p>

    <p><strong>If you do not wish to have Cookies placed on your computer, you should set your browsers to refuse Cookies before accessing the Website, with the understanding that certain of the services and certain features of the Website may not function properly without the aid of Cookies.  If you refuse Cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>c. Web Beacons.</strong> "<span class="underline">Web Beacons</span>" (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access Cookies. Unlike Cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, Web Beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages (or in e-mail). Web Beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. For additional information on our uses of Web Beacons, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies &amp; Web Beacons, below. </p>

    <p><strong>d. Ad Serving.</strong> We use third-parties for advertising and analytics for pages that we host. These third-parties may place Cookies on your machine, use Web Beacons, gather Personal Information, gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data in order to deliver relevant metrics, content, and advertising. The collection of this information by third-parties are subject to such third-parties' privacy policies.  For additional information, see the section concerning Third-Party Websites, below.</p>

    <p><strong>e. Personal Information.</strong> During the loan application process, you will be asked to provide us certain
        information that personally identifies you ("<span class="underline">Personal Information</span>"). Personal Information includes, without
        limitation: (1) "<span class="underline">Identity/Contact Data</span>" (such as your name, address, email address, social security number,
        driver's license or state ID number, your employer and your employer's address); (2) "<span class="underline">Financial Information</span>"
        (such as your bank, bank address, bank phone number, bank account type, length of time with your bank, your ABA
        routing number and your account number); (3 ) "<span class="underline">Demographic Data</span>" (such as your birthday, city/town, zip code, state,
        home ownership status, employment history, pay period frequency, next pay period and monthly income). In each case,
        you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Website will not gather it surreptitiously. <strong>By providing
        financial account numbers and social security numbers, you consent the collection by us of such information.</strong>
        We may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public
        sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies, third-party service providers, etc.) who may
        lawfully provide such information to us.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION USE AND DISCLOSURE PRACTICES</h3>

            <p>"100DayLoans is the easiest application to fill out because you only have to fill it out once. If later you need another loan, the information has been saved, all you need to do is update what is there. I have gotten loans from 100DayLoans previously and recommend them to anyone in need of quick, short term cash!"</p>
