<br>
Your privacy is important, so we have created the following Privacy and Security Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit our websites, 101groupdeal.com (the "Site"), why we collect it, and how it is used. This Privacy and Security Policy also addresses our data security practices, the options you have to access and control any personally identifiable information you provide to us, and other matters. This Privacy and Security Policy is governed by our Terms and Conditions. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of the Privacy and Security Policy and the Terms and Conditions, the Terms and Conditions shall govern. We may periodically make changes to this Privacy and Security Policy which will be included on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy and Security Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. By using the Site, you agree to this Privacy and Security Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy and Security Policy and it supersedes any earlier version.<br>

         ·                                    Navigation and Clickstream Data<br>

As you browse our Site, we may gather navigational and clickstream data that shows what pages are visited and how long various features are used. This information will not reveal your identity or be linked to you personally. We use this information to complete, support and analyze your purchases from us; to facilitate and improve your use of the Site; to comply with any requirements of law; to serve, or have a third party serve specialized or relevant advertising content and/or recommendations to you on the Site or on a third party’s website; for internal purposes; and to determine any commissions due to our Affiliates.

We may from time to time supply the owners or operators of third party sites from which it is possible to link to our Site with information relating to the number of users linking to our Site from their sites. You cannot be identified from this information.<br>
<br>
<b>IV.    We May Use Third Party Advertising Companies To Serve ADS For Us</b><br>
<br>
These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. They may also use this technology to serve specialized or relevant advertising content and/or recommendations to you on the Site or on a third party’s website. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous and does not contain any personal contact information. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, including how to opt-out, please drop us an email at: support@101groupdeal.com.<br>
<br>
<b>V.   When and Why We Might Disclose Your Personal Information</b><br>
<br>
We may disclose your information to our staff and to third parties involved in the completion of your transaction, the delivery of your order, and the analysis and support of your use of the Site. We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct, or we have good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the requirements of law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on us or (2) to protect and defend our property or other rights, the users of the Site or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk protection. If we should ever file for bankruptcy, are part of a reorganization, sell our assets or merge with another company, we may sell the information you provide to us through the Site to a third party or share your personal information with the third party or company we merge with.<br>
<br>
<b>VI.     What are Cookies? Why Do We Use Them?</b><br>
<br>
Cookies are very tiny text files that are stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages that record your preferences. We use cookies to provide you with the best level of service by keeping track of what you have in your shopping cart, remembering you when you return to our store and using them to help us show you advertisements which are relevant to your interests. They cannot harm your computer and they do not contain any personal or private information. You must accept cookies to shop through the Site. You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but the Site may not work correctly or at all if you set your browser not to accept cookies.<br>
<br>
<b>VII.     How Long Do We Keep User Information?</b><br>
<br>
We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it (for instance for taxation or insurance purposes or in case orders may give rise to claims). We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.<br>
<br>
<b>VIII.    Third Party Websites?</b><br>
<br>
This Site may contain links to third party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites even if you access those using links from our Site. Your use of these third party websites is entirely at your own risk and we recommend that you check the privacy and security policy of each site you visit. When you click on a third party link, you are essentially taken to a third party’s website. We make no representation or warranty as to the effectiveness, quality, legitimacy or data protections of any third party website.<br>
<br>
<b>IX.     Information about Products and Services We Offer</b><br>
<br>
It is very important to us that we provide you with the highest level of service. In order to help us do this, from time to time we may send you details of products and services which we think may be of interest to you. We may send you marketing communications with your consent. If at any time you do not wish to receive these details and wish to unsubscribe from marketing communications, you may do so by accessing your account through the My Account link located at the top of each page on the Site.<br>
