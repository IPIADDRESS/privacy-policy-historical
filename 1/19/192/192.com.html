	      <h2> About www.192.com</h2>
	      <p> 192.com has been providing online directory enquiries since 1997. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users by keeping all personal information that we collect secure and by only using such data for the purpose(s) for which it was collected and for which we have our users’ consent. While our objective is to provide the most comprehensive UK directory of people and businesses we also respect the choice of people to be removed from particular published databases. We are registered with the Office of the Information Commissioner under the Data Protection Act 1998. </p>
	      
	      <h2>Information that we collect during the registration process </h2>
	      <p> If you register with 192.com we will ask you to provide a small amount of personal information including, but not limited to, your name, address and email address. This information helps us to ensure that your account is protected and allows us to display private information to you about your account. Your e-mail address is used as your 192.com username, but it also provides us with a means of contacting you about your account, about the service we offer and to promote our products and services to you.</p>
	      
	      <h2> Personally Identifiable Information </h2>
	      <p> We do not share Personally identifiable Information with Third Parties. </p>
	      <p><strong>Choice/Opt-out </strong> We provide you with the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/ser vice but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.</p>
	      <h2> The 192.com Newsletter </h2>
	      <p> When you register with 192.com we will seek your consent to send you our monthly newsletter by email through which we will keep you informed about our service and provide offers and promotions.

	      <p> We may also collect supplementary information about you from other sources such as public records or information obtained by other companies and legitimately supplied to 192.com.</p>
	      <h2> Does anyone else have access to my information? </h2>
	      <p> Except where detailed elsewhere in this policy 192.com does not disclose your personal information to any other person or organisation except when we may disclose personal information to our employees and companies acting as data processors on our behalf. In addition we may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (i) comply with the legal process, (ii) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of 192.com, our users or the public.</p>
	      <h2> Information that we collect about your usage of the service </h2>
	      <p> We keep automatic logs of usage by all users (whether registered or not) including the IP (Internet Protocol) address from which a user session was conducted, the date and time of each search made and the results provided in response to a search. We may use this information to assist in improving the nature and quality of the service we offer; we may, if requested by data subjects, provide them with details of searches conducted on them; and we also reserve the right to pass on such logs to the police in the event that it might assist with an investigation.
