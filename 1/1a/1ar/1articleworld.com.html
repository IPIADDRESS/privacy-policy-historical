If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of
your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We
provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ
in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
<strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard
technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and web
server log files to collect information about how our Web site is used.
Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date
and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web
sites visited just before and just after our Web site. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Do We Use the
Information That You Provide to Us?<br>
</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Broadly
speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business
activities, providing the products and services you requested, to process your
payment, to monitor the use of the service, our marketing and promotional
efforts and improve our content and service offerings, and customize our site's
content, layout, services and for other lawful purposes. These uses improve our
site and better tailor it to meet your needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Furthermore, such
information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally
identifiable information or business information will not be shared with parties
except as required by law. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Occasionally, we may also
use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our
Website, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable. You
may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing
us, after which we will remove your records from our system. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What Are Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique
identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer
for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically
designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if
your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser
only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not
the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept
cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the
configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your
browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not
function as effectively when viewed by the users. </span><b>
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A cookie cannot retrieve any
other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Do We Use
Information We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you
from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having
to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our
Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people
visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps
us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our
clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you
and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser
provided to us in your cookies. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">IP Addresses</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the
Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network
to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web
server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that
data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Sharing and Selling
Information</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely
identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone
except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services
that you have requested. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Can You Access
and Correct Your Information?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we
collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at the usual address.
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What About Legally
Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>
</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We may disclose
information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good
faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal
rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe
that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring
legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to
protect the safety of our users and the Public. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What About Other
Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from
our Web site or the information or content contained therein. Often links to
other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that
may be useful to the users of our Web site. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Please remember that when
you use a link to go from our Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is
no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site,
including web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web
site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before
proceeding. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Your Consent</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal
information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend
this privacy policy at any time with or without notice. </span></p>
<p><em><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
Our Commitment To Data Security:<br>
</span></b></em><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Please note
that your information will be stored and processed on our computers. To prevent
unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of
information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and
managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Surveys &amp; Contests<br>
</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">From time-to-time
our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation
in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has
a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may
include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic
information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to
notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for
purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A Special Note About
Children<br>
</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Children are not
eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask that children (under the
age of 14) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you
can use this service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your
parents or guardians. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Acquisition or Changes
in Ownership<br>
</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In the event that
the web site (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your
information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of those
assets that are transferred. </span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Policy Modifications<br>
</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We may change this
Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to this privacy
policy, we will email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post
any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be
assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the
personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a
manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your
prior consent.</span></p>
