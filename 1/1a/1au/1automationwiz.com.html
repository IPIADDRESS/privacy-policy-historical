Said notice shall be made immediately upon confirmed discovery of the breach and the time necessary such as to allow us to determine the scope of the breach, to identify organizations and individuals affected by the breach, and to restore reasonable integrity of the data system that was breached.</p>
					<p>If a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency determines that notice to organizations required under this policy would interfere with a criminal investigation, the notice shall be delayed upon the written request of the law enforcement agency for a specified period that the law enforcement agency determines is reasonably necessary. A law enforcement agency may, by a subsequent written request, revoke such delay as of a specified date or extend the period set forth in the original request made under this paragraph to a specified date if further delay is necessary.
