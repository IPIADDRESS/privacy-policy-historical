<h1>1AutomationWiz Privacy Statement:</h1>
<p class="smalltxt1">Cyber Samurai Marketing, Inc. strives to offer its visitors
the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized
experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,
street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy Policy. We
will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party.
Period."</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">How we gather information from users</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">How we collect and store information depends on the page you
are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided.
For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access
to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters
or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in
sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas
of our site. </p>
<p class="smalltxt1">Like most Web sites, our company also collects information automatically
and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors.
For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie
technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things,
the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter
that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter
a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology,
we may also gather information through other means. </p>
<p class="smalltxt1">In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information,
for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you
may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter
your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features
according to your preferences.</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">What we do with the information we collect</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance
your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your
privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about
your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance
our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features
are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our
advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally
Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
Cyber Samurai Marketing, Inc., 1AutomationWiz.com, and our company web sites to communicate
with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service
and privacy Policy; services and products offered by Cyber Samurai Marketing, Inc.
and other topics we think you might find of interest. </p>
<p class="smalltxt1">Personally Identifiable Information collected by Cyber Samurai
Marketing, Inc., 1AutomationWiz.com, and our company web sites may also be used for
other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting,
processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests,
and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support
for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such
information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge
or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information
may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do
so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or
to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please
note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">Cyber Samurai Marketing, Inc., 1AutomationWiz.com, and our company
web sites expect its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy
of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers,
affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their
own privacy and data collection statement and practices. For example, during your
visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame of content that is
actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through our company web sites
you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features,
contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Cyber Samurai Marketing, Inc. is
not responsible for the actions or statements of such third parties. You should check
the applicable privacy statements of those third parties when providing information
on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or
other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some
of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising
is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to
determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features
available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies
or other technology to gather information. Cyber Samurai Marketing, Inc. does not
control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information,
and is not responsible for any actions or statements of such third parties.</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can
be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge
and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such
activities are beyond the control of Cyber Samurai Marketing, Inc. and this Policy.</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">Children</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">Cyber Samurai Marketing, Inc. does not knowingly collect or
solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except
as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child
under 13 in violation of this Policy, we will delete that information immediately.

under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.</p>

<p class="smalltxt1">Changes to this Policy</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">Cyber Samurai Marketing, Inc. reserves the right to change this
Policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued
use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept
those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will
be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information
was collected.</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">Governing law</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">This Policy and the use of this Site are governed by Missouri
law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with
the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: St. Louis,
Missouri. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation
will be shared equally by each of us.</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory
solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration
at the following location: St. Louis, Missouri, under the rules of the American Arbitration
Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in
any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p class="smalltxt1">This statement and the statements outlined herein are not intended
to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any
party.</p>
