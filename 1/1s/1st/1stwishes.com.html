<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Celebrate Express is very concerned about the protection of online privacy for all our Web site visitors. Although we track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site, personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. Additionally, customers may use our "Tell A Friend" feature to forward an e-mail to their friends telling them about Celebrate Express, however, we do not retain e-mail addresses captured in this process.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Our Web site uses Microsoft Site Server technology which allows IP Addresses to be collected and used for administrative purposes, and to analyze traffic patterns for this site. However, no single individual is identified in the analysis of Web traffic. This technology also includes the use of cookies which benefit visitors by saving their information so they don't have to re-type it on subsequent visits to our site. Cookies may be disabled by the user, however, the user would not be able to order products from our site because our shopping cart functionality requires the use of cookies to operate. Orders can always be phoned in by calling 1-800-424-7843.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">We also use pixel tags - tiny graphic images - to tell us what parts of our Web site you have visited and/or to measure the effectiveness of any searches you may do on our site. In addition, we may contract with other companies that use cookies or other online tools such as pixel tags to measure the performance of a marketing effort on our behalf. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">We make it our top priority to safeguard the privacy of our online customers, and we take great care in making sure that your personal identifiable information is secure.

</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">We also collect payment information in order to bill shoppers for items they ordered. To complete business transactions, credit card numbers are verified by a qualified financial institution using secure encryption technology before an order is shipped.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">In some instances, when an e-mail address has been provided by the visitor (age 18 or older), we will send notices to the visitor, usually in the form of e-mail. These periodic notices will announce the status of an order or Web site changes. Information submitted by visitors who sign up for our Birthday Club is collected in a separate area of our site than information submitted by customers who are placing product orders. While we may communicate with visitors via e-mail about their order, we will not send promotional e-mails unless the visitor has specifically chosen to receive such messages.
