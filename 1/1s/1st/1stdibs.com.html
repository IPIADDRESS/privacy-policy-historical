                <p>The 1stdibs.com website and mobile application (collectively the “Site”) are owned and operated by 1stdibs.com, Inc. This Privacy Policy describes how information, including Personal Information, is collected from you and subsequently used, shared, secured and otherwise processed by 1stdibs.com, Inc. and our affiliated companies (“1stdibs.com”, “1stdibs”, “us” or “we”).</p>
<p><strong>“Personal Information”</strong>, is any information that enables us to identify you, directly or indirectly, such as your email address, name, shipping and billing address, telephone number, company name, credit card information, any form of identification number or one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.</p>

We encourage you to check our Site frequently to see the current Privacy Policy and User Agreement in effect and any changes that may have been made to them.</p>
<p>2. Information 1stdibs.com collects from you.</p>

<p>4. 1stdibs.com uses cookies.</p>
<p>The Site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users. This helps us to analyze the use of the Site to customize and improve the content and the layout of the Site. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them, see our Cookie Policy&nbsp;<a href="https://support.1stdibs.com/s/article/Cookie-Policy/">https://support.1stdibs.com/s/article/Cookie-Policy/</a>.</p>
<p>5. How does 1stdibs.com use your Personal Information?</p>
<p>We use your Personal Information according to the terms of the Privacy Policy and User Agreement in effect at the time of our use. We will process your Personal Information where (1) you have provided your consent which can be withdrawn at any time, (2) where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party (for example, we will share your Personal Information with sellers with whom you have entered into a transaction), (3) where we are required by law, (4) where processing is required to protect your vital interests or those of another person, or (5) where the processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate commercial interests, except where such interest are overridden by your rights and interests.</p>
<p>a) We may use the Personal Information you give us for our legitimate commercial interests including, among other things:</p>
<p>– to respond to your inquiries and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us;</p>
<p>– to provide information on the products or services of our registered sellers with whom you are placed in touch with in connection with a prospective purchase;</p>
<p>– to verify that you qualify as a member of the Site;</p>
<p>– to send you communications about (1) our own products and services, (2) products and services offered by sellers or advertisers on our Site and (3) products and services of third parties (those not offered by sellers on our Site) that we think you may find of interest, provided you have given your consent;</p>
<p>– where the processing is required in order to enforce or apply our User Agreement and other agreements you have entered into; and</p>
<p>– to contact you as necessary.</p>
<p>b) We may use the Personal Information we collect in either an identifiable or an anonymized form (independent of any personal identifiers):</p>
<p>– to administer the Site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;</p>
<p>– to improve the Site and to customize the content you see on the Site;</p>
<p>– as part of our efforts to keep the Site safe and secure;</p>
<p>– to measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you; and</p>
<p>– to do internal research on our Site visitors’ interests and behaviors to better understand and serve our members.</p>
<p>We use email as the primary form of communicating transactional and relationship information with registered sellers and registered Site users. We may send mobile users notifications through the application but only if the user has agreed to receive notifications from us in their preferences. Preferences can be changed via Settings at any time. We may also use your street addresses and telephone numbers to provide these communications.</p>
<p>When users of the Site wish to negotiate a sale with sellers or make a purchase from a seller they do so by contacting the seller using a telephone number displayed on the Site which is operated by Us. When a user connects with a seller by telephone that call may be recorded by us to log transactions and for training and quality purposes. We may use a carefully selected third party to carry out such call recording and transcription services on our behalf. If a user or seller does not agree to this when notified of this fact by us at the beginning of a call, the call should be terminated. No call recordings are shared with third parties other than as described in this Privacy Policy, and we take steps to eliminate Personal Information from the call recording.</p>

Once your offer is submitted, your Personal Information will be delivered by 1stdibs.com to that seller, and your order will be placed.</p>

<p>Third parties who will have access to your Personal Information include (without limitation) sellers selling items on the Site that you have contacted or made a purchase from, shipping companies selected by you or the dealer, and payment processors completing a transaction at your request.</p>
<p>Sellers from whom you purchase items may use your Personal Information for their own purposes including marketing purposes.

<p>We will only transfer your Personal Information to trusted third parties who provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures governing the processing to be carried out and who can demonstrate a commitment to compliance with those measures.</p>
<p>Where third parties are processing Personal Information on our behalf, they will be required to agree, by contractual means or otherwise, to process the Personal Information in accordance with the applicable law. This contract will stipulate, amongst other things, that the third party and its representative shall act only on our instructions, or as permitted by law.</p>
<p>These companies may use your information for their own purposes including marketing to you where you have consented to receive notifications relating to their products and services. We may also disclose your Personal Information to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce our User Agreement or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our users or others (e.g., to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection etc.).</p>
<p>In the event of a corporate transaction, such as the purchase, sale or other transfer of all or part of our services or assets, we may transfer your Personal Information along with those assets or services to a prospective transferee.</p>
<p>7. International transfers</p>
<p>The Personal Information we receive may be held on our computers and systems in the European Union and in the computers and systems of our offices and data centers in the United States and may be accessed by or given to our staff working outside the European Union.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the United States, where laws regarding data protection may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By using this Site and by providing any Personal Information to the Site, all users, including without limitation users in Canada and the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such Personal Information in the United States.</p>
<p>In addition, sellers registered on the Site are located around the world. Due to the nature of our business and to enable us to offer goods and services worldwide, your Personal Information may be transferred to and held by merchants or sellers in any country in the world. By using this Site and by providing any Personal Information to the Site, all users, including without limitation users in Canada and the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such Personal Information by such third parties.</p>
<p>8. How you can access and amend your Personal Information.</p>
<p>You are required to provide us with accurate and up to date Personal Information. 1stdibs.com gives you the ability to amend your Personal Information at any time by accessing your account on our Site (by clicking on the “account details” link on the website homepage or the Account icon on the mobile application), modifying the Personal Information on your account page, acknowledging our User Agreement by clicking on the box at the bottom of the page and then clicking on submit.</p>
<p>If you do not want to share search terms, or items you have viewed, saved, or purchased history with sellers you contact, you can update your profile preferences on your account page at any time.</p>
<p>Subject to any legislation which might, from time to time, oblige us to store the Personal Information for a certain period of time, we will respect your wishes to correct inaccurate Personal Information. Otherwise, we will hold your Personal Information for as long as we believe it will help us to achieve our aims as detailed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You can ask us whether we are keeping Personal Information about you and you can ask to receive a copy of that Personal Information. Before sending you any Personal Information, we will ask you to provide proof of your identity. If you are not able to provide proof of your identity, we reserve the right to refuse to send you any PersonalInformation. We will respond as quickly as we can to your requests for details of Personal Information we hold about you.</p>
<p>9. Security.</p>
<p>As a registered user of the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password. Please keep your user ID and password confidential.</p>
<p>If you share your computer, we recommend that you log-out and close your browser window after visiting the Site in order to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information including your credit card information, your offer status and buying history.</p>
<p>You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, or remove or edit content at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>We use reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help us protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of data stored on our system. The Site encrypts your credit card number and other Personal Information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure transmission of the Personal Information from your PC to our servers.</p>
<p>Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your Personal Information to the employees, officers, third-party contractors, and strategic partners of 1stdibs.com who need the Personal Information in order to perform their duties.</p>
<p>SSL is an industry-standard protocol for encryption over the Internet. While no system is 100% secure, we believe that the measures we have implemented minimize the risk of a security breach to an appropriate level given the types of Personal Information involved. Please note that any Personal Information you provide us by email is unencrypted.</p>
<p>Please note that transmission of Personal Information via the internet is not completely secure and although we will endeavor to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Site; any transmission is therefore at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access, however.</p>
<p>10. Opt- out</p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive offers or other notices from us in the future, you can “opt-out” by changing your preferences in My Account or by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this policy. We will try to complete your request as promptly as possible. You can elect not to receive emails from us either by “unsubscribing” to an email you receive or by contacting us as indicated below. Any changes will affect only future uses of your information.</p>
<p>11. Your California privacy rights</p>
<p>For California Residents Only. We may disclose your Personal Information to our affiliates or registered sellers when the third party receives Personal Information solely as a consequence of a single transaction where, as a part of the transaction, Personal Information had to be disclosed in order to effectuate the transaction.</p>
<p>12. Your European privacy rights</p>
<p>For individuals within the EEA only. Under the GDPR, in certain circumstances, you have the right to: (a) request access to any Personal Information we hold about you and related information, (b) obtain without undue delay the rectification of any inaccurate Personal Information, (c) request that your Personal Information is deleted provided the Personal Information is not required by 1stdibs.com for compliance with a legal obligation under European or Member State law or for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim, (d) prevent or restrict processing of your Personal Information, except to the extent processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and (e) request transfer of your Personal Information directly to a third party where this is technically feasible.</p>
<p>In addition, where you believe that 1stdibs.com has not complied with its obligation under this Privacy Policy or European law, you have the right to make a complaint to an EU Data Protection Authority, such as the UK Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>
<p>13. Links to third-party sites</p>
<p>When you use the Site or our service, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control. These may include merchant sites where you select items for purchase or payment sites where you pay for your purchases.</p>
<p>We may also allow third party sites or applications to link to the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties or the content of linked sites, but we do encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such parties or websites.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy only applies to our Sites.</p>
