The Site encrypts your credit card number and other Personal Information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure transmission of the information from your PC to our servers. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your information to the employees, officers, third-party contractors, and strategic partners of 1stdibs.com who need the information in order to perform their duties.  SSL is an industry-standard protocol for encryption over the Internet. While no system is 100% secure, we believe that the measures we have implemented minimize the risk of security breach to an appropriate level given the types of information involved. Please note that any information you provide us by email is unencrypted. </p>
            <p class="legal-copy"> Please note that transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and although we will endeavor to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Site; any transmission is therefore at your own risk.
