            <p class="legal-copy"> 9. Security. </p>
            <p class="legal-copy"> As a registered user of the Site you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password. Please keep your user ID and password confidential. If you share your computer, we recommend that you log-out and close your browser window after visiting the Site in order to protect the confidentiality of your data including your credit card information, your offer status and buying history. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, or remove or edit content in our sole discretion. </p>
            <p class="legal-copy"> We use reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help us protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of data stored on our system. The Site encrypts your credit card number and other Personal Information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure transmission of the information from your PC to our servers. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your information to the employees, officers, third-party contractors, and strategic partners of 1stdibs.com who need the information in order to perform their duties. SSL is an industry-standard protocol for encryption over the Internet. While no system is 100% secure, we believe that the measures we have implemented minimize the risk of security breach to an appropriate level given the types of information involved. Please note that any information you provide us by email is unencrypted. </p>
            <p class="legal-copy"> Please note that transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and although we will endeavor to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Site; any transmission is therefore at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access however. </p>
            <p class="legal-copy"> 10. Opt Out </p>
            <p class="legal-copy"> If you do not wish to receive offers or other notices from us in the future, you can "opt out" by changing your preferences in My Account or by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this policy. We will try to complete your request as promptly as possible. You can elect not to receive emails from us either by "unsubscribing" to an email you receive or by contacting us as indicated below. Any changes will affect only future uses of your information. </p>
            <p class="legal-copy"> 11. Your California Privacy Rights </p>
            <p class="legal-copy"> For California Residents Only.

            <p class="legal-copy"> 12. Links to Third-Party Sites </p>

These may include merchant sites where you select items for purchase or payment sites where you pay for your purchases. We may also allow thirds-party sites or applications to link to the Site.
