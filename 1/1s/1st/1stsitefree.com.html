<p><a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (COPPA) is designed to safeguard children's privacy online by regulating the collection of personal information from children under 13. COPPA was passed by Congress in October 1998 and went into effect on April 21, 2000. 

</p><ul>
<li>The primary goal of the Act is to place parents in control over what information is collected from their children online. And as parents, it is important to be involved in children's online activities and educate them about playing it safe. 

</li><li>Many resources are available to help parents when it comes to children's privacy. I encourage parents to check out these sites for additional information: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy">www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy</a> and <a href="http://www.getnetwise.org/">GetNetWise</a>.
