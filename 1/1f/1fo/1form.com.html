<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>1form.com.au is committed to privacy legislation in the way it collects, uses, secures and discloses personal information.</p>
<p>1Form Online Pty Ltd is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the Web site www.1form.com.au. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our privacy officer David Mitchell at <a href="mailto:tenantenquiries@1form.com.au">tenantenquiries@1form.com.au</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=">http://watchdog.truste.com</a></p>
<p>TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.</p>
<h4>The information we collect</h4>
<p>When you sign up as a tenant we collect your name, email address, mailing address and phone number. We also collect sensitive information such as your passport number. We collect demographic information such as date of birth and gender. We collect information from you about joint applicants.  We collect information directly from any joint applicant who signs up with us, and we link that information to your account.</p>
<p>If you provide us with information about another person, we rely on you to inform those individuals that you are providing their personal information to us and to advise them that we can be contacted for further information.</p>
<p>After you have created your profile you may provide us with additional information such as your Driver’s License number, photo (which will appear on your application), previous address of residency, and employment information as well as a personal reference and a business reference.</p>
<p>All the information you provide to us (other than your credit card number) is passed onto the real estate agent, property managers or landlord and forms part of your rental application for the purposes of assessing your application for tenancy to live in the property for which you are applying.</p>
<p>If you are a Property Manager you will need to download the PDF form and fill it out and fax it back to us at the fax number indicated on the form. We use the information to create your account so that you may manage your tenancy applications online.</p>
<p>If you choose not to provide certain personal information (e.g. your date of birth), we may not be able to provide you with the services you require.</p>
<h4>How we use your information</h4>
<p>We collect information from you for the purpose of creating an online account for you so that you may use our platform.</p>
<p>We use and disclose your personal information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To establish and maintain your relationship as a customer of 1form.com.au.</li>
	<li>To provide the services you have requested from 1form.com.au.</li>
	<li>To administer and manage those services.</li>
	<li>To answer your inquiry.</li>
	<li>Where you have consented to the use or disclosure of your personal information.</li>
	<li>For direct marketing by email, specials on products or services you have shown interest in.</li>
	<li>To provide you with information about offers, promotions, goods or services, which we believe may be of interest to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may share your personal information with our service providers and other third parties and their contract partners for the purposes of analytics and reporting, including reporting to agents, lead generation to real estate agents and so that the third parties can contact you directly about their offers, promotions, goods or services.
</p><p>We may share your personal information with third parties who provide products and services regarding property and real estate. In doing so, we ensure that such third parties have a privacy policy that applies to your information. If you would like a list of who we provide your personal information to, please contact our privacy officer. If you do not wish to have your personal information provided to third parties, please contact our privacy officer.</p>
<p>If we contact you for direct marketing without obtaining your prior consent, we will provide you with the opportunity to decline any further marketing communications. If you at any time receive any communication from 1form.com.au which you would not like to receive, please contact us at <a href="mailto:tenantenquiries@1form.com.au">tenantenquiries@1form.com.au</a> and we will remove your name from our mailing list, or you may use the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each email communication.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
<p>You consent to our use and disclosure as set out above</p>
