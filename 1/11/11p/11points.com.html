<span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 10pt;">
At 11Points, I am committed to protecting your privacy and providing an honest, pleasant experience. The policies and disclosures are provided so that you may understand how I operate this site and how your privacy is protected.<br><br>
<b>Aggregate Visitor Information</b> <br><br>
For each visitor to 11Points, the Web server automatically recognizes anonymous information such as the name of your ISP, browser used, connection speed, date and time of visit and the pages you access. This data does not allow for the specific identification of any particular user, but is aggregated with all other visitor information. The information is used to help improve the site, analyze trends and provide a better experience for my readers.
To try and bring you online offers that are of interest to you, I have relationships with other companies that I allow to place ads on 11Points. As a result of your visit, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, IP address and location. No personal contact information is collected without your consent. For further information, consult the privacy policies of any advertiser you find on our site.<br><br>
<b>Visitor Contact Information</b><br><br>
No personal information is collected from visitors without their knowledge and consent. Email addresses are collected from visitors who choose to communicate with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, or from those leave comments on the site. Visitors may also provide links to their websites, responses to reader polls or other information when using the site. Personal contact and financial information may be collected from visitors who make purchases on the site or register for additional access or services. Any financial information provided by the user will be transmitted through a secure server.<br><br>
The information I collect is used to improve the content of our web page and to contact readers for personal communication and marketing purposes. I do not sell or distribute any contact information to other businesses or organizations unless required by a financial institution to complete a financial transaction initiated by the visitor. This means your email and postal mail addresses will not be given to others who might want to sell you stuff unless you specifically request it. Any email or postal mail from Blogging Startup to promote our site or services will be infrequent and provide you with an option to request that no further emails be sent.<br><br>
If you do not want to receive email from me, please let me know by sending me and email. My email is supplied at the bottom of this document. Visitors who supply me with their telephone numbers online will only receive telephone contact from me with information regarding orders they have placed online or for reasons specifically requested by the individual.<br><br>
Upon request, I will provide site visitors with a description of information that is maintained about them and access to this information with proof of identity. If you are interested in accessing this information contact me through the website or at any of the contact addresses at the bottom of this document. Upon request, visitors may be given the ability to have inaccuracies corrected in contact and transaction information. Again, contact should be made through the website or at any of the addresses below.<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b><br><br>
This website may use cookies to track information relevant to affiliate marketing, advertising and to improve the user experience. A small piece of data written on a user's hard drive that records information about a visitor to be used at a later time.<br><br>
If you do not want cookies to be added to your hard drive during your visit, you may disallow cookies on your individual browser. The disable cookie function is found under options or Internet options on most browsers. You can also delete cookies that have been added to your computer through a feature on most browsers. The location of this feature varies from one browser to another.<br><br>
<b>Comments</b><br><br>
Visitors are encouraged to leave comments on any post that allows commenting. Please make an effort to leave comments that are relevant to the topic and further the conversation. Simple comments such as "thank you" or "good article" may be kind, but do not add to the experience for other readers. Comments such as these may be deleted.  In addition, comments without a verified first and last name may be deleted or rejected.<br><br>
Comments are appear to only have the purpose of promoting other websites or commercial ventures will also be deleted. This site uses state-of-the-art spam control, so most spam comments will never make it to the webpage. Additionally, I will report any commenter as a spammer if they attempt to leave unrelated, self-promoting links on this site.<br><br>
When leaving a comment, users are warned not to use only keywords for their website.  Names with overt keyword plugs will be deleted. You may use your personal name or a branded pseudonym when leaving comments. You may also include a link in your comment if that link is relevant to the topic discussion.<br><br>
<b>Links</b><br><br>
This site contains links to other sites and services. I encourage you to review the privacy statements of those sites and services that you choose to visit, so that you can understand how they may collect, use and share your personal information. I am not responsible for the privacy statements or practices of sites and services controlled by other companies or organizations.<br><br>
Additionally, the presence of a web link on 11Points is not an endorsement of that websites content. Although I do occasionally recommend some content found on a particular site, I can not fully endorse all content or ensure that content is not changed subsequent to my recommendation.<br><br>

From time to time, I may update this privacy notice. I will notify you about important changes in the way I treat personally identifiable information by placing a notice on this site. I encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you always will know what information is collected, how it is used, and to whom information is disclosed. Your continued use of the Blogging Startup website following the posting of any changes to these terms will mean that you have accepted those changes.<br><br>
