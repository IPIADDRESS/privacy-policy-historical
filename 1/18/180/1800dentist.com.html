<h4 class="ptitle">Privacy Statement of 1800dentist.com</h4>
<p class="ctext">
<a href="https://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.1800dentist.com" target="_blank"><img src="img/verify.gif" align="right" border="0" alt="Site privacy statement reviewed by TRUSTe, click to verify"></a>
Your privacy is very important to us. As part of the normal 
operation of our site we collect and disclose information about you. This 
Privacy Statement describes the information we collect about you and what may 
happen to that information. As described below, some of your personally 
identifiable information is used only by 1800dentist.com</p>
<h4 class="ptitle">Information We Collect</h4>
<p class="ctext">In our online find-a-dentist pages, to match you with a 
dentist, we require you to provide us with your full name, contact information, 
and dental need. In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain 
information about you. This information includes the URL that you just came from 
(whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you go to next (whether this 
URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. 
Most sites automatically collect this information. </p>
<p class="ctext">In addition, we use cookies on certain pages of our site. 
Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. You are always free to 
decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may be 
required to re-enter certain information more frequently during a visit to our 
site. </p>
<p class="ctext">If you send personal correspondence to us, such as e-mails or 
letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. </p>
<h4 class="ptitle">Our Use of Your Information</h4>
<p class="ctext">We use the information you provide to return to you a list of 
up to&nbsp;three member dentists from which you may choose your new dentist. 
Additionally, we use personally identifiable information about you internally to 
improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site 
usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's 
content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and 
better tailor it to meet your needs. </p>
<h4 class="ptitle">Our Disclosure of Your Information</h4>
<p class="ctext">Once you have selected a new dentist using our site, we send 
your name and contact information via fax to your new dentist. </p>
<p class="ctext">We have never&nbsp;sold, shared, or rented any personally 
identifiable information about you to any third party. 1800dentist.com 
cooperates with all law enforcement inquires. Therefore, local, state and 
federal law enforcement can request your name, street address, city, state, zip 
code, phone number, and e-mail address. Unfortunately, due to the existing 
regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications 
and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways 
not otherwise described in this Privacy Statement. By way of example (without 
limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the 
government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may 
unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Further, 
we can disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government 
officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. 
Therefore, although we use industry-standard practices to protect your privacy, 
we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable 
information or private communications will remain private. </p>
<h4 class="ptitle">Security</h4>
<p class="ctext">1800dentist.com uses industry-standard efforts to safeguard 
the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as 
firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist 
on the Internet. </p>
