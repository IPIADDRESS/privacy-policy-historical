	    This policy describes  the personal information we collect about you, why we collect it, and how we  use it. Our policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect  and use your information.</p>
	  <p>If you have any  questions about our privacy policy, please contact us via:<br>
	    Email at <a href="mailto:info@1800contacts.com">info@1800contacts.com</a><br>
	    Call us toll-free at 1-800-CONTACTS (1-800-266-8228)<br>
	    Write to us at: 8757 South State    St. Sandy, UT   84070.</p>
	  <p>If our information  practices change in the future, we will notify you by posting the policy  changes directly to this web page. We will post any such change before we use  any of your information in any way other than as explicitly stated in this  policy.</p>
	  <p>At 1-800 CONTACTS, we  value our customers and respect your privacy. We don't sell, rent or loan any  information about you to any third party. We collect customer information to be  able to process your order and verify your prescription (if necessary and only  with your authorization), as well as improve your shopping experience and to  communicate with you about our products, services, contests, surveys and  promotions. 1-800 CONTACTS recognizes that it must maintain and use customer  information responsibly.</p>
	  <p><strong>What kind of  information does 1-800 CONTACTS collect?</strong><br>
	    We collect information  (such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, patient name, contact lens  prescription, phone number, credit card numbers and the name and phone number  of your eye care provider) that you provide when you place an order, register  with us or participate in a contest, survey, or promotion. We also maintain a  record of your historical purchases that are placed through the phone, mail,  fax, e-mail and over the Internet. Because all of our information systems are  fully integrated, when you place an order with us, your customer information is  available to you through any channel through which you may choose to contact us  (phone, postal mail, fax, Internet or e-mail.)</p>
	  <p>We have contracted with  and are currently using Omniture, a third party service provider, to track and  analyze non-personally identifiable information about our visitors and  customers. We use this information to improve our site and plan for technical  improvements. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of 1-800 CONTACTS is  owned and used solely by 1-800 CONTACTS. We reserve the right to publish  non-personally identifiable summary information regarding our website visitors  for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers.  Please note that this is not personal information, but consists of only general  summaries of the activities of our visitors and customers.</p>
	  <p>Omniture uses cookies  to help track visitor behavior and sets cookies on behalf of 1-800 CONTACTS.  These cookies will be listed under the domain 207.net.

	  <p><strong>How does 1-800 CONTACTS  use my information?</strong><br>
	    We use your personal  information to respond to and fulfill your orders. We will also send you an  e-mail to confirm your order, and we may need to contact you via phone, mail or  e-mail if we have any questions regarding your order. We may contact you by  e-mail, postal mail or by phone (either directly or through a service provider  bound by strict confidentiality standards working on our behalf) to help us  learn more about your shopping preferences so that we may better serve you in  the future. In addition we may use your information to help us better improve  our site design and your shopping experience. We may also send you notices  about our products, services, contests, surveys and promotions or news about  contact lenses through postal mail.</p>
	  <p><strong>Does 1-800 CONTACTS  share my information with third parties?</strong><br>
	    Except as explained in  the next paragraph, we do not share your personal information with any third or  outside party. We do not sell, rent or loan any information about you to any  third parties.</p>
	  <p>PLEASE NOTE: On all  orders placed, we do attempt to verify or obtain a copy or your contact lens  prescription from the eye care provider that you designate. This information is  held under the same strict confidentiality standards as described above and in  accordance with all applicable law.</p>
	  <p><strong>How do I access my  information? How do I update my information?</strong><br>
	    Registered customers  can access their account information online by clicking the "My  Account" link at the top of any of the pages on <a href="../">www.1800contacts.com</a> and entering your email address and password. This will load the My Account  portion of the website and allow you to edit your billing, shipping and email  preferences, and alter your login and password settings. You can also make  general changes to your account information by calling us at 1-800-CONTACTS  (1-800-266-8228) to speak with a Customer Service Representative.</p>
	  <p><strong>How do I remove my  information from e-mail, postal mailing and telephone lists?</strong><br>
	    If you prefer not to  receive notice of promotions, reorder information or updates on contact lens  laws by email, please click the "My Account" link at the top of any  of the pages on <a href="../">www.1800contacts.com</a> , enter your email address and password and click on "email options".  You will be able to specify your email preferences on this page. If you wish to  be removed from all email communications not related to your order, you can  call one of our Customer Service Representatives at 1-800-CONTACTS  (1-800-266-8228). If you prefer not to receive postal mail, please let us know  by sending us an email at info@1800contacts.com or call one of our Customer  Service Representatives at 1-800-CONTACTS (1-800-266-8228).</p>
	  <p>PLEASE NOTE: Requests  to be removed from the postal mail list may take up to 6-8 weeks to become  effective. In addition, if you ask to remove your name and address from our  e-mail or postal mailing lists, we will maintain your name in a "do not  mail" file to ensure that we can honor your request. When you make a  purchase, we will send you an e-mail to confirm your order and may also need to  contact you via phone, postal mail or e-mail if we have other questions  regarding your order.</p>
	  <p><strong>How does 1-800 CONTACTS  protect children's privacy?</strong><br>
	    Like you, we are  concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent  with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never  request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.</p>
	  <p>If we become aware that  a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable  parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable  registration information from our files.</p>
	  <p><strong>What about links to  other Internet sites and services?</strong><br>
	    We may maintain links  to other websites that are not under our control. These websites have their own  policies regarding privacy, which you should review before visiting them. We  have no responsibility for linked websites and provide these links solely for  the convenience and information of our customers.</p>
	  <p>	    <strong>How does 1-800 CONTACTS  make sure my order information is secure?</strong><br>
	    Protecting your order  information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology  to protect the security of your online order information.</p>
	  <p>	    More than 90% of  Fortune 500 companies use SSL security to protect their sensitive information.  When you use our secure ordering page you can be assured that your sensitive  information and monetary transactions with us are encrypted, safe, and secure.</p>
	  <p>	    To check the security  of your connection, look at the lower corner of your browser window after  accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on  your browser), the SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check  by looking at the URL line of your browser. When assessing a secure server, the  first characters of the site address will change from "http://" to  "https://".</p>
	  <p><strong>What is adware? What is  spyware? Does 1-800 CONTACTS use adware or spyware?</strong><br>
	    Adware  is software that is installed on your computer that can, for example, create  pop-up advertisements or cause your browser to be redirected to other websites.  We do not participate in or use third party services that use adware, such as  Gator.com, whenu.com or ezula.com. We have determined that there are instances  where this type of advertising could be construed as confusing for customers.  Therefore, we work to ensure that these third party adware services do not  function on the 1-800 CONTACTS website, <a href="../">www.1800contacts.com</a></p>
	  <p>	    Spyware is also  software that is installed on your computer that can, for example, record and  transmit information regarding the websites you visit, or record or transmit  your keystrokes to a third party. Spyware, like adware, is often installed  without the knowledge of the person using the computer. We do not use spyware  and we work to ensure that spyware does not function on the 1-800 CONTACTS  website.</p>
	  <p><strong>What are cookies? How  does 1-800 CONTACTS use cookies on its site?</strong><br>
	    A cookie is a small  file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit  their websites. A cookie may contain information that is used to track the  pages of the sites you've visited.</p>
	  <p>	    We use cookies in order  to improve your shopping experience. When you visit the 1-800 CONTACTS website,  your cookie helps us keep track of your order as you shop at our site. If you  are a registered customer, your cookie allows us to recognize you when you  return to our site and provides you with access to your account information. If  you register with or order from us, we also use cookies to monitor and maintain  information about your use of our website in a manner that identifies you as a  customer. This information helps us serve you better by improving our site  design, as well as our products, services, contests, surveys and promotions.</p>
	  <p>	    You  can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off  cookies, however, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make  a purchase from our site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered  user to allow you access to your account information.</p>
