            <p><span class="SmTitle"><a name="12"></a>How does 1-800 CONTACTS, 
              INC. protect children's privacy?</span><br>
              Like you, we at 1-800 CONTACTS, INC. are concerned about the safety 
              of children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's 
              Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never request personally 
              identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.</p>
            <p>If we become aware that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and 
              has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will 
              remove his or her personally identifiable registration information 
              from our files.</p>
            <p><span class="SmTitle"><a name="13"></a>What about links to other 
              Internet sites and services?</span><br>
              1-800 CONTACTS, INC. may maintain links to other sites that are 
              not under our control. These Web sites have their own policies regarding 
              privacy, which you should review before visiting them. We have no 
              responsibility for linked Web sites and provide these links solely 
              for the convenience and information of our customers. </p>
            <p><span class="SmTitle"><a name="security"></a>Internet Security:</span><br>
              How does 1-800 CONTACTS, INC. make sure my order information is 
              secure?</p>
            <p>Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use 
              Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of 
              your online order information.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies use SSL security to protect 
              their sensitive information. SSL security makes eavesdropping on 
              the Internet nearly impossible. When you use our secure ordering 
              page you can be assured that your sensitive information and monetary 
              transactions with<br>
              1-800 CONTACTS, INC. are encrypted, safe, and secure.</p>
            <p>To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand 
              corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you 
              see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), 
              the SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check 
              by looking at the URL line of your browser. When assessing a secure 
              server, the first characters of the site address will change from 
              "http://" to "https://."</p>
            <p>Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't allow or permit 
              communication through secure servers. In that case, we have established 
              a "Standard Server" option that you may select. This option 
              is available on the Home page and is located just below the "Existing 
              Customer" button. This connection does not use SSL technology 
              and is not secure. If you can't access either of these servers or 
              for any reason and would like to place your order by calling one 
              of our Customer Service Representatives please dial 1-800-CONTACTS 
              (1-800-266-8228).</p>
