<h3>
 Data Security</h3>
<p>
 <strong>How do we protect your data?</strong></p>
<p>
 Drillinginfo takes data security very seriously and we use industry-standard physical, technical, and administrative procedures. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.</p>
<p>
 Our services use industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.

<p>
 It's important to stress, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about our security protocols, please email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@drillinginfo.com">support@drillinginfo.com</a>.</p>
<p>
 <strong>How can you improve your data security from side?</strong></p>

 When logging into the Drillinginfo website and specific products, you should take every precaution to protect your own personal information, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters, numbers and symbols, and make sure you use a secure browser.</p>

We commit to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources and non-human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>
