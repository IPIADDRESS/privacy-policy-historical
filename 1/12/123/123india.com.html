<li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you; 
</li><li>What cookies are and how they are used;
</li><li>How your information is used;  
</li><li>Who is collecting your information;  
</li><li>With whom your information may be shared;

<p></p>
<ul><li><b> What personally identifiable information does 123India.com collect from  
             me?</b></li></ul>
123India.com collects information in several ways from different parts of  
             our network of web sites.  
<p>   Some personal information is gathered when you register. During  
             registration, 123India.com asks for your name, email address, birth date,  
             gender, zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests. The more  
             information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are  
             able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer  
             anonymous to 123India.com - you are given a 123India.com ID and are  
             able to take full advantage of 123India.com's many offerings.  
</p>
<p> In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at  
             other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes,  
             contest or promotion sponsored by 123India.com and/or our many  
             partners; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a  
             problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact 123India.com we  
             may keep a record of that correspondence. 123India.com also  
             occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research  
             purposes. Wherever 123India.com collects personal information we make  
             an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 
</p><p></p><ul><li><b> What are cookies and how does 123India.com use them?</b></li></ul>  
             As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized  
             services, 123India.com uses cookies to store and sometimes track  
             information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to  
             your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard  
             drive. All sites on 123India.com where you are prompted to log-in or that  
             are customizable require that you accept cookies. (See "What are my  
             choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?"  
             for more information on cookies.)  
<p></p>
<p>
</p><ol>Generally, we use cookies to:  
<p></p><li>Remind us of who you are and to access your account information  
             (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more  
             personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In"  
             and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. 123India.com also  
             uses cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as Yellow  
             Pages.  <p></p>
<p></p></li><li> Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing 123India.com is  
             given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of  
             repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user,  
             and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.  <p></p>
<p></p></li><li> Track your progress and number of entries in some of our  
             promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a 123India.com-hosted  
             promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates  
             the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track  
             entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings.  <p></p>
<p></p></li><li>Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of 123India.com's  
             network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the  
             aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are  
             similar or different from one another so that we can make each new  
             experience on 123India.com a better one. We may use this information to  
             better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and  
             other users will see on our sites. <p></p>
</li></ol>
<p><b>Third Party Cookies :</b>Advertising networks that serve ads onto 123India.com may also use  
their own cookies. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser
may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.</p>
<p></p><ul><li><b>How does 123India.com use my information?</b></li></ul>
123India.com's primary goal in collecting personal information is to  
             provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of  
             sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications,  
             and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to  
             you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display  
             advertisements. By knowing a little about you, 123India.com is able to  
             deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better  
             service, to you.<p></p>
<!-- <p> In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, 123India.com plays the  
             middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of  
             audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old).  
             123India.com takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting  
             that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual  
             account information. Only 123India.com has access to individuals'  
             accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads.  
             You will only receive special offers via email from 123India.com if you  
             have indicated in your account preferences that you would like to  
             receive them. You can change your account preferences at any time.  </p> -->
<p> 123India.com does research on our users' demographics, interests, and  
             behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration,  
             during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this  
             to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and  
             analyzed on an aggregated basis. 123India.com may share this  
             aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.  </p>

 When you are on a 123India.com site and are asked for personal  
             information, you are sharing that information with 123India.com alone,  
             unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some 123India.com  
             services, like 123India.com Travel, are offered in conjunction with a  
             partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it is  
             necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner  
             company. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company  
             other than 123India.com, you will be notified prior to the time of the data  
             collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can  
             choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. <p></p>
<p> Promotions that run on 123India.com may be sponsored by companies  
             other than 123India.com or may be cosponsored by 123India.com and  
             another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be  
             shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior  
             to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to  
             participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. </p>

<p></p><ul><li><b> With whom does 123India.com share my information?</b></li></ul> 
 As a general rule, 123India.com will not disclose any of your personally  
             identifiable information except when we have your permission or under  
             special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the  
             law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see  
             the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and  
             services for more detailed information about how your personal  
             information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways  
             that your information may be disclosed.  <p></p>
<p>   Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: 123India.com may disclose your personal  
             information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically  
             described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data.  
             Details of shared use can be found in specific Terms of Service or Use  
             Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions rules. Some or all data  
             collected during a 123India.com promotion may be shared with a  
             sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will  
             tell you before we collect or transfer the data. </p>
<p> Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information  
             from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give 123India.com  
             permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they  
             can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will  
             be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will  
             be notified prior to the transfer.  </p>
<p> From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive  
             materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt-in to receive  
             information from these third parties, 123India.com will (with your  
             permission) share your name and email address with them . </p>
<p> Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality  
             agreements, 123India.com may match user information with third party  
             data. Also, 123India.com discloses aggregated user statistics (for  
             example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to  
             current and prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and  
             for other lawful purposes. </p>
<p> Other: 123India.com may also disclose account information in special  
             cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is  
             necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who  
             may be violating 123India.com's Terms of Service or may be causing  
             injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally)  
             123India.com's rights or property, other 123India.com users, or anyone  
             else that could be harmed by such activities. 123India.com may disclose  
             or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law  
             requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem  
             necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.</p>
<p></p><ul><li><b> What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my

 123India.com may, from time to time, send you email regarding our

             that you are interested in receiving offers or information from  
             123India.com and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail  
             about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only  
             123India.com (or agents working on behalf of 123India.com and under  
             confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only  
             if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you do not

             drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you  
             automatically receive promotion-related email, unless you choose the no- 
             email option that some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion- 
             related email messages may include targeted advertisements. </p>
<p> You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your  
             browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be  
             notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to  
             reject all cookies you will be unable to use those 123India.com services  
             that require registration in order to participate </p>
<p> 123India.com does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will  
             notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be  
             shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not  
             permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be

             password. <br>
  Your 123India.com account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so  
             will result in not being able to access any members-only area of the  
             123India.com network, including your 123India.com Mail account (if you  
             have one). If you saved the confirmation email you received when you

             in that message to delete your account at any time. Please contact <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@corp.123india.com">

<p></p><ul><li><b> What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or  
             alteration of my information?</b></li></ul>  
 Your 123India.com Account Information and 123India.com Profile are  
             password-protected so that you and only you have access to this  
             personal information. You may edit your 123India.com Account  
             Information and 123India.com Profile by using your 123India.com ID and  
             password.  <p></p>
<p>  We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.  
             123India.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited  
             phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your  
             123India.com account and close your browser window when you have  
             finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your  
             personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with  
             someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or  
             Internet cafe. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless  
             network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we  
             strive to protect your personal information, 123India.com cannot ensure  
             or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our  
             online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we  
             receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security  
             on our systems.  </p>
<p></p><ul><li><b> What else should I know about my privacy?</b></li></ul>
 Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal  
             information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in  
             chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In  
             short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the  
             public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in  
             return.  <p></p>
<p> Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your  
             passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and  
             responsible whenever you're online.  </p>
