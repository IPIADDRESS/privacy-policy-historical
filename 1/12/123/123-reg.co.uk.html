				<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
				<p>The purpose of this policy is to explain how Pipex collects, protects, and uses personal 
				data. Pipex is committed to ensuring that any personal data supplied by its customers or is 
				otherwise generated by its business activities is collected and processed fairly and lawfully.</p>

				<h3>2. What Types Of Personal Data Does Pipex Collect?</h3>
				<p>Pipex needs certain personal data to enable it to provide its products and services to its 
				customers and end users. The personal data collected will generally include: company name, 
				company size and sector, individual contact names and job titles for delivery, installation, 
				support and billing, postal address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses. Pipex also 
				has access to personal data that is generated over the Network utilised by Pipex services 
				including IP and email addresses for incoming and outgoing data and network usage data. 
				In certain circumstances Pipex may also collect financial information about Pipex customers and 
				end users from third parties to enable Pipex to assess its risks in granting credit terms and 
				contact information about organisations Pipex considers may be interested in Pipex products and 
				services.</p>

				<h3>3. How Does Pipex Obtain Personal Data?</h3>
				<p>Pipex obtains personal data in a number of ways including from orders placed by customers 
				and end users (whether by telephone, fax or email or by application form); from enquiries made 
				by existing customers and potential customers, (including information gathered at marketing 
				events and via the Pipex website); from third party list brokers; from resellers who pass on 
				personal data to Pipex about end users; and directly from the Network utilised by Pipex services.</p>

				<h3>4. How Does Pipex Use The Personal Data It Holds?</h3>
				<h4>4.1 Providing and Improving the Pipex Service</h4>
				<p>Most of Pipex's use of personal data is necessary to enable it to provide a service to its 
				customers and its end users, including order processing, delivery, installation and support 
				services as well as for invoicing and in order to answer general customer enquiries. In 
				addition, Pipex may also use personal data to improve on the level and type of service Pipex 
				offers to its customers. As part of this interest in improving the service provided Pipex may 
				process personal data for the purposes of sales analysis and customer usage statistics.</p>

				<h4>4.2 Direct Marketing</h4>
				<p>Pipex may from time to time inform its customers, end users and potential customers about 
				Pipex and Pipex affiliate products and services and other information Pipex feels may be of 
				interest.</p>
				<p>Customers and other recipients of information from Pipex may indicate at the time they first 
				place an order with Pipex whether or not they wish to receive such information or at any later 
				time by simply contacting Pipex as indicated in paragraph 9 below.</p>

				<h3>5. Does Pipex Transfer Personal Data Overseas?</h3>
				<p>As Pipex is part of a global organisation with local operating companies in a number of 
				countries worldwide, to fulfil its customer service obligations it is necessary for Pipex to 
				transfer and process personal data outside the country in which the personal data is collected. 
				This will include transfers to Pipex affiliates based in the United States. Prior to making any 
				such transfer Pipex will put in place security procedures and firewalls designed to prevent 
				unauthorised use of or access to personal data.</p>

				<h3>6. To Whom Does Pipex Disclose Personal Data?</h3>
				<p>Pipex will pass personal data within its internal departments in order to fulfil sales and 
				support obligations as well as to finance departments to enable invoicing.</p>
				<p>As a general rule, Pipex does not disclose personal data to unaffiliated third parties except 
				where customer consent has been obtained, where Pipex is under an obligation by law to disclose 
				personal data or where Pipex has contracted with third parties to assist in providing services 
				to Pipex customers such as for delivery, installation and systems support services.</p>

				<h3>7. How Does Pipex Protect the Personal Data it Holds?</h3>
				<p>Pipex takes customer confidentiality and security very seriously. Pipex has implemented 
				appropriate internal security procedures that restrict access to and disclosure of personal 
				data within Pipex. These procedures will be reviewed from time to time to determine whether 
				they are being complied with and are effective.</p>
				<p>Pipex will also actively investigate and cooperate with law enforcement agencies any 
				allegations of abuse or violation of system or network security as set out in the applicable 
				Pipex Acceptable Use Policy 
				(<a href="http://www.pipex.net/legal/aup/" title="Pipex Acceptable Use Policy">http://www.pipex.net/legal/aup/</a>).</p>

				<h3>8. Customers' Rights</h3>
				<p>The law in certain jurisdictions (including countries within the European Economic Area) 
				gives individuals whose personal data is held by Pipex specific rights to access and rectify 
				personal data held about them. These include the right to:</p>
				<h4>8.1</h4>
				<p>obtain from Pipex, for a prescribed fee, confirmation that personal data is held, as well 
				as a written description of such personal data, the purpose(s) for which it is being used, 
				the source(s) of the personal data and details of any recipients;</p> 
				<h4>8.2</h4>
				<p>request the deletion or rectification of personal data which is 
				inaccurate; and</p>
				<h4>8.3</h4>
				<p>as explained in paragraph 4.2 above to object to any unsolicited 
				information sent by Pipex regarding promotions or new products and services.</p>

				<h3>9. Contact Details</h3>
				<p>If any individual wishes to contact Pipex regarding the personal data held about them or has 
				any other question about Pipex's data privacy procedures, they should direct an email to 
				<a href="mailto:privacy@pipex.net" title="contact Pipex regarding personal data">privacy@pipex.net</a> or send a letter to the direction of "Pipex Customer Services Department" 
				at the local Pipex office.</p>

				<h3>10. Policy Updates</h3>
				<p>As part of Pipex's commitment to compliance with data privacy requirements, and to reflect 
				changes in Pipex's operating procedures, Pipex may update the terms of this policy from time to 
				time, and will post the revised policy at 
				<a href="http://www.pipex.net/legal/dppp/" title="revised policy">http://www.pipex.net/legal/dppp/</a>.</p>
