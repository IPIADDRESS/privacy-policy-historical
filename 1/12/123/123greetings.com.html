Also, if you ask one of our customer service representatives to help you send an eCard or to verify that an eCard was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the card, including the recipient's e-mail address and the message.<br></p><p>
If we have reason to believe, that a card has been sent using a false email address or attempt to pose as someone else when sending a card, information about you - including your computer's IP address - may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.<br></p><p>
123Greetings.com uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to third parties we believe to be responsible.
