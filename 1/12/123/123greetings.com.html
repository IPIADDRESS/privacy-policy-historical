            <!--span class="submitted">Submitted by admin on Tue, 06/02/2009 - 12:11.</span-->    <div class="content"><p><b>Overview</b><br>
123Greetings.com, Inc. is a leading provider of free greeting cards on the Internet. This Overall Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for the entire 123Greetings.com website.</p>
<p><b>Statement</b><br>
123Greetings.com respects your right to privacy. Because we gather certain types of information about our users we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather and how we use it.</p>
<p><b>What Information does 123Greetings.com collect ?</b><br>
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services. Because we derive revenue mainly from advertising, collecting information is essential to keep our services affordable to users.</p>
<p>We collect personal information about our users during usage of the 123Greetings.com service, from our use of 'cookie' technology as you use the service and during sending or viewing an ecard through 123Greetings.com or while subscribing to our newsletter and special offer services.</p>
<p><b>What is 123Greetings.com's practice regarding cookies ?</b><br>
Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to Internet websites. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit 123Greetings.com. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information which we may use to enhance your services in the ways described below. You may choose not to allow cookies to be collected by adjusting your settings on your browser.</p>
<p>We use technologies, including electronic images known as Web beacons (called a transparent GIF or single-pixel GIF) that allow us to track general user traffic patterns. We also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our website, and information about pages you visited. The information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you unless you have specifically given us personally identifiable information. We may use the information to enhance your services in the ways described below.</p>
<ul>
<li> We use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including:</li>
<li>Keeping count of return visits to our website or our advertisers' or partners' websites.</li>
<li>Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on website and advertisement usage.</li>
<li>Determining which features our overall user population likes best.</li>
<li>Saving your name &amp; e-mail address so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our website.</li>
<li>Display the most appropriate advertising based on your interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>We allow other companies that are presenting advertisements on our websites and, sometimes, in our newsletters to use tracking technology on your computer. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Unless you visit the website of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable information about yourself, these tracking technologies tell those advertisers nothing about who you are. Our advertisers' use of tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
<p><b>How does 123Greetings.com use the information it collects ?</b><br>
We use the information we gather for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li> To customize the advertising and content you see</li>
<li>To enhance the user experience in our website. We use tracking information to determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</li>
<li>To fulfill your requests for fresh content and services.</li>
<li>To send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How does 123Greetings.com share this information and with whom ?</b><br>
We aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. For example, we may tell our business partners how many customers in certain demographic groups sent certain ecards.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above policies, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to appropriate third-parties if we are required to do so by law or we believe that such action is necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>To comply with legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order;</li>
<li> To protect the company's rights and property;</li>
<li>To investigate reports of users sending material using a false e-mail address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages;</li>
<li>To protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website and/ or the 123Greetings.com service;</li>
<li>During emergencies, such as when we believe someone's physical safety is at risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address can be accessed by recipients in the source of the ecard HTML. Under certain circumstances, recipients, their legal representatives, and/ or law enforcement authorities may be able to combine this with information disclosed by ISPs to determine the source of a particular communication. By using this service, you knowingly and voluntarily assume any risks associated with such disclosure.</p>
<p><b>What is 123Greetings.com's practice regarding IP addresses ?</b><br>
We collect and analyze traffic on our website by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally. However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message.</p>
<p>123Greetings.com includes the sender's IP Address in the source of each ecard HTML that is created at the website. This is available to the ecard recipient and anyone else who has access to the recipient's ecard. This limits your ability to communicate anonymously using ecards. ecards are not intended for anonymous communications, and such activity is expressly prohibited by our Terms of Use. What does 123Greetings.com do with the ecard messages &amp; information ?</p>
<p>When you send one of our ecards, the information you provide to us is used to customize your greeting with the recipient's name and with your message, and to deliver an e-mail to the recipient. We treat our ecards as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient and the contents will not be disclosed to anyone other than the intended recipient.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, we will not monitor or edit the contents of the online ecards you send. Occasion, however, we may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your ecard or the maintenance of our network. Also, if you ask one of our customer service representatives to help you send an ecard or to verify that an ecard was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the ecard, including the recipient's e-mail address and the message.</p>
<p>If we have reason to believe, that an ecard has been sent using a false e-mail address or attempt to pose as someone else sending an ecard, information about you - including your computer's IP address - may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.</p>
<p>123Greetings.com uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive the information. 123Greetings.com also links to a wide variety of other websites. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users.</p>
