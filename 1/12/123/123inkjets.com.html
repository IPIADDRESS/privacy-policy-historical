<p>
This Privacy Policy 
discloses the privacy practices for 123inkjets website and various related 
services (together referred to as the "site"). <b>As the provider of this, we 
are committed to protecting your privacy online. In a nutshell our privacy policy states that we will never 
rent, sell or lease your information to anyone else. 
So, please read the information below to learn the following regarding your use 
of this site.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>
You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our Site Terms of Use, and 
by accessing or using our site, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and 
conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use this 
site. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes, 
modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice 
thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to issuing an 
email to the email address listed by registered users and posting the revised 
Policy on this page. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to 
maintain a valid email address as a registered user, review this site and this 
Policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications. Your continued use of 
the site after such modifications will constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of 
the modified Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the modified 
Policy. </p>
<p><b>1.&nbsp; Types of Information Collected </b>
</p>
<p>In order to better provide 
you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our 
users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable 
Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide 
you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us 
know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this 
site, such as registering for a membership, ordering a product or service, 
submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public 
areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us 
feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by 
filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to 
elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us 
personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address 
(including zip code), email address, employer, job title and department, 
telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal identifying information. 
When ordering products or services on the site, you may be asked to provide a 
credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask 
you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not 
provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not 
be able to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable 
Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a 
specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where 
you visit on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed 
on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web 
site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you 
next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") 
address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the 
World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a 
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the 
World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route 
information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP 
address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you 
are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. 
Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the 
Internet.
</p>
<p><b>2.&nbsp; Collection Methods and Use of 
Information </b>
</p>
<p>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless 
you voluntarily provide it to us.&nbsp; You provide certain Personally Identifiable 
Information to us when you (a) register for our services and register your email 
address with us; (b) enter sweepstakes or contests sponsored by us or one of our 
partners; (c) sign up for special offers from selected third parties; (d) send 
email messages, submit forms or transmit other information by telephone or 
letter; or (e) submit your credit card or other payment information when 
ordering and purchasing products and services on our site. We may also collect 
information from you at other points on our site that state that such 
information is being collected.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In addition, we may also 
collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain 
Non- Personally Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored 
in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your 
IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our 
site and to gather demographic information. Our third party ad servers will also 
provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many 
ads were presented and clicked upon at out site.
</p>
<p>We will primarily use your 
Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you, as required 
by our agreements with you. We will also use Personally Identifiable Information 
to enhance the operation of our site, fill orders, improve our marketing and 
promotional efforts, statistically analyze site use, improve our product and 
service offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, and services. We 
may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you and to 
contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personally 
Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce 
our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use, Sales Terms and 
Conditions, and this Private Policy.
</p>
<p><b>3.&nbsp; Release of Information </b>
</p>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to 
others. We do provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with 
affiliates, services providers, partners and other third parties. We (and our 
service partners) use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our 
sites and to deliver their services. For example, we must release your credit 
card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and 
services purchased on this site; release your address information to the 
delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order 
information to third parties that help us provide customer service.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>We will encourage our 
service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your 
Personally Identifiable Information by our service partners is governed by the 
privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control.
</p>
<p>Occasionally we may be 
required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally 
Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will 
disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, 
subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully 
cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our 
services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law 
enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be 
unlawful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
We may also provide 
Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers' sales, traffic 
patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers, but these 
statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information. </p>
<p><b>4.&nbsp; Updating and Correcting Information </b></p>
<p>We believe you should have 
the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information that you 
have provided to us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable 
Information in your account online at any time by linking to your account in 
accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on this site. You may also access 
and correct your personal information and privacy preferences by writing us at: </p>
<p>123Inkjets<br>
25 E. Easy Street<br>
Simi Valley, California 
93065&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please include your name, address, and/or email address when you contact us. </p>
<p>
We encourage you to promptly 
update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to 
have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we 
keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with 
past transactions on this site. In addition, it may be impossible to completely 
delete your information without some residual information because of backups. </p>
<p><b>5.&nbsp; User Choices on Collection and Use of 
Information </b></p>
<p>
We may, from time to time, 
send you email regarding our products and services. In addition, if you 
indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or 
information from us and our partners. Only we 
(or agents working on behalf of [~ name of us and under confidentiality 
agreements) will send you these promotional offers and only if you indicated 
that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such 
mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any 
time you can edit your account information to no longer receive such offers and 
mailings. </p>
<p>
You also have choices with 
respect to cookies, as described below. By modifying your browser preferences, 
you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, 
or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our 
site may not work properly in your case. </p>
<p><b>6.&nbsp; Security of Information </b></p>
<p>
At our site you can be 
assured that your Personally Identifiable Information is secure, consistent with 
current industry standards. The importance of security for all Personally 
Identifiable Information associated with our user is of utmost concern to us. 
Your Personally Identifiable Information is protected in several ways. Access by 
you to your Personally Identifiable Information is available through a password 
and unique customer ID selected by you.&nbsp; This password is encrypted. We 
recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your 
Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only 
selected key personnel and contractors have access to via password. We encrypt 
your Personally Identifiable Information and thereby prevent unauthorized 
parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us.</p>
<p>
Personal information that 
you provide that is not Personally Identifiable Information also resides on a 
secure server and is only accessible via password. Since this information is not 
accessible from outside our company you will not be asked to select a password 
in order to view or modify such information. </p>
<p>
In order to most efficiently 
serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by 
established third party banking, processing agents and distribution 
institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your 
card or other payment information and to process and ship your order. </p>
<p>
Unfortunately, no data 
transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 
100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally 
Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and 
privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the 
security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged 
between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such 
information and data may be illegally viewed or tampered with in transit by a 
third party.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>7.&nbsp; Cookies </b> </p>
<p>When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to 
facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text 
file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser 
permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies store 
randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are 
located, and your first name to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make 
your use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us to 
maintain a secure site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your 
browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly in that case. </p>
<p>We may use an outside ad serving company to display banner advertisements on our 
site. As part of their service, they will place a separate cookie on your 
computer. We will not provide any third-party ad server with any of your 
Personally Identifiable Information or information about your purchases. We and 
our third party ad server will collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable 
Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your 
computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server 
and whether you responded to a particular ad. Other advertisers may also place 
banner ads on our site in the same manner as above, but we will not disclose any 
Personally Identifiable Information to them.</p>
<p><b>8.&nbsp; Privacy Policies of Third Party Sites </b> </p>
<p>Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only 
addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other sites 
accessible through our site have their own privacy policies and data collection,

not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Additionally, 
other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information 
about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of 
cookies. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact 
these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the 
information that they collect.</p>
