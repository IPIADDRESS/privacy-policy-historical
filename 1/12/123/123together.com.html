    </div>
    <div id="MPcontentsmtxt">
      <p><strong>123Together.com Privacy Statement:</strong><br>
        123Together.com has created this privacy statement ("Statement")
        in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on
        the 123Together.com web site (the   "Site") is of great importance
        to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers,
        we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information
        gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this
        Statement and will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30)
        business days prior to the change taking effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Collected Information:</strong><br>
        We require customers who register to use the services ("Services")
        offered on our Site to give us contact information, such as their name,
        company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial
        qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address,
        credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that
        will be using the Services. You may also add additional personal information,
        such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information,
        such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry, when adding
        users. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by
        not entering it when asked. Customers can update or remove their personal
        information at any time by logging into the Website and editing their Personal
        Information within Setup. Customers can view their updated profile to confirm
        their edits have been made.</p>
      <p>123Together.com uses the information that we collect to set up Services
        for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information
        to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company,
        the Services that we provide, and to send information regarding our company
        or partners, such as promotions and events. Customers are invited to receive
        an email newsletter by providing an email address. Customer email addresses
        and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared
        with any third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us,
        or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email
        to Support@123Together.com. Separately, customers are also asked to provide
        an email address when registering for the Service, in order to receive
        a username and password. We may also email information regarding updates
        to the Service or company, and will send a Customer Newsletter. Again,
        email will not be distributed or shared and customers can opt out of receiving
        any communication by emailing Support@123Together.com at the time it is
        distributed, or at the time any customer registers for the Service.</p>
      <p>Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as
        provided for in the 123Together.com Master Subscription Agreement, we do
        not disclose to any third-party the information provided. All financial
        and billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely
        to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for Services.
        This billing information is not used by 123Together.com for marketing or
        promotional purposes. 123Together.com uses a third-party intermediary to
        manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in
        the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the
        information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.
        Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on
        the web Site but they are not permitted to collect any information nor
        does 123Together.com share any user information with these parties.</p>
      <p>Customers will be using the Services to host data and information ("Data").
        123Together.com will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference
        any Data except as provided in the Terms of Service, or as may be required
        by law. 123Together.com does not claim ownership of any of the Data, including
        any text, data, information, images, photographs, music, sound, video,
        or other material, that is uploaded, displayed or stored as part of the
        customerâs Data. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed
        only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected
        violation of the Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. Of course,
        customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security
        of their user registration and password.</p>
      <p>123Together.com may also collect certain information from visitors to
        and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information
        is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site
        in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also
        track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical
        information from our visitors and customers and provide such information
        to third parties.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies:</strong><br>
        When you interact with the 123Together.com Website we strive to make that
        experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Web site, our Web
        server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers
        place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers
        and visitors have visited the Site previously.</p>
      <p>Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize
        your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to 123Together.com,
        either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering
        for a 30-day Test Drive, you remain anonymous to 123Together.com. Cookies
        come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist
        only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you
        close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies
        remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off
        your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for
        your browser.</p>
      <p>123Together.com uses session cookies containing encrypted information
        to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This
        information allows 123Together.com to process your online transactions
        and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you
        are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the 123Together.com
        application. 123Together.com uses persistent cookies, that only 123Together.com
        can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a 123Together.com customer
        or prior 123Together.com Website visitor (whatever the case may be). We
        are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information
        stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers
        or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers'
        ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Website but will not
        be able to successfully use our service.</p>
      <p><strong>Third-Party Sites:</strong><br>
        The Site contains links to other web sites. 123Together.com is not responsible
        for the privacy practices or the content of these other web sites. Customers
        and visitors will need to check the policy statement of these others
        web sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access
        a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is the
        responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential.</p>
      <p><strong>Security:</strong><br>
        Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss,
        misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Site is
        accessed using Netscape Navigator, or Microsoft Internet Explorer versions
        5.0 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information
        using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that
        Data is safe, secure, and available only to you. 123Together.com also
        implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded
        session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment
        that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference
        or access from outside intruders. Finally, 123Together.com provides unique
        user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs
        on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data
        accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.</p>
      <p><strong>Opt-Out Policy:</strong><br>
        123Together.com offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how
        we may use information provided. If, at any time after registering for
        information or ordering Services, you change your mind about receiving
        information from us, send us a request specifying your new choice. Simply
        send your request to Support@123Together.com.</p>
      <p><strong>Correcting &amp; Updating Your Information:</strong><br>
        If customers need to update or change registration information they may
        so by editing the user or organization record. To update a User Profile,
