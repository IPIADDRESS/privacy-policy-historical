<p><a name="covers"><strong>What This Privacy Policy Covers</strong></a><br>This policy covers how 12Frenz treats personal information
	that 12Frenz collects and receives, including information related to your past
	use of 12Frenz products and services. Personal information is information about
	you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or
	phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies
	that 12Frenz does not own or control, or to people that 12Frenz does not employ
	or manage. <br></p><p><a href="privacyPolicy.do#top">[top]</a><br> </p>

<p><strong><a name="use">Information Collection and Use</a><br>General</strong></p>

<p>12Frenz collects personal information when you register with
	12Frenz, when you use 12Frenz products or services, when you visit 12Frenz
	pages or the pages of certain 12Frenz partners, and when you enter promotions.
	12Frenz may combine information about you that we have with information we
	obtain from business partners or other companies. </p>

<p>When you register we ask for information such as your name,
	email address, birth date, gender, post code, occupation, industry, and
	personal interests. When you register with 12Frenz and sign in to our services,
	you are not anonymous to us. </p>

<p>12Frenz collects information about your transactions with us
	and with some of our business partners. </p>

<p>12Frenz automatically receives and records information on
	our server logs from your browser and/or hand phone, including your IP address,
	12Frenz cookie information, phone number and the page you request. </p>

<p>12Frenz uses information for the following general purposes:
	to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for
	products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and
	provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. </p>

<p><strong>Children</strong><br>When a child under age 13 attempts to register with 12Frenz,
	we ask the child to have a parent or guardian create a 12Frenz Family Account
	to obtain parental permission.<br>12Frenz does not contact children under age 13 about special
	offers or for marketing purposes without a parent's permission.<br>12Frenz does not ask a child under age 13 for more personal
	information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to
	participate in a given activity or promotion.</p><p><a href="privacyPolicy.do#top">[top]</a> </p>

<p><a name="disclosure"><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></a></p>

<p>12Frenz does not rent, sell, or share personal information
	about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide
	products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under
	the following circumstances: </p>

<p>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on
	behalf of or with 12Frenz under confidentiality agreements. These companies may
	use your personal information to help 12Frenz communicate with you about offers
	from 12Frenz and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have
	any independent right to share this information. </p>

<p>We have a parent's permission to share the information if
	the user is a child under age 13. Parents have the option of allowing 12Frenz
	to collect and use their child's information without consenting to 12Frenz
	sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this
	information for their own purposes.</p>

<p>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or
	to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>

<p>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to
	investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
	fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
	person, violations of 12Frenz's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. </p>

<p>We transfer information about you if 12Frenz is acquired by
	or merged with another company. In this event, 12Frenz will notify you before
	information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy
	policy. </p>

<p>12Frenz displays targeted advertisements based on personal
	information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that
	people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting
	criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. </p>

<p>12Frenz does not provide any personal information to the
	advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by
	interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that
	the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria
	used to display the ad. </p>

<p>12Frenz advertisers include financial service providers
	(such as banks, insurance agents, stopk brokers and mortgage lenders) and
	non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). </p>

<p>12Frenz works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other
	service providers in different industries and categories of business. For more
	information regarding providers of products or services that you've requested
	please read our detailed reference links.</p><p><a href="privacyPolicy.do#top">[top]</a> </p>

<p><a name="cookies"><strong>Cookies</strong></a><br>12Frenz may set and access 12Frenz cookies on your computer.
</p>

<p>12Frenz lets other companies that show advertisements on
	some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other
	companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not
	this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to 12Frenz's
	cookies. </p>

<p>12Frenz uses web beacons to access 12Frenz cookies inside
	and outside our network of web sites and in connection with 12Frenz products
	and services.</p><p><a href="privacyPolicy.do#top">[top]</a> </p>

<p><strong><a name="info">Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and
	Preferences</a><br>General</strong><br>You can edit your 12Frenz Account Information, including
	your marketing preferences, at any time. </p>

<p>New categories of marketing communications might be added to
	the Marketing Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can
	opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories
	or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages
	they receive. </p>

<p>We reserve the right to send you certain communications
	relating to the 12Frenz service, such as service announcements, administrative
	messages and the 12Frenz Newsletter, that are considered part of your 12Frenz
	account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. </p>

<p>You can delete your 12Frenz account by visiting our Account
	Deletion page. Please click here to read about information that might possibly
	remain in our archived records after your account has been deleted. <br><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong> </p>

<p>We limit access to personal information about you to
	employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that
	information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their
	jobs. </p>

<p>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to
	protect personal information about you.</p><p><a href="privacyPolicy.do#top">[top]</a> <br></p>

<p><a name="policy"><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></a></p>

<p>12Frenz may update this policy. We will notify you about
	significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a
	notice to the primary email address specified in your 12Frenz account or by
	placing a prominent notice on our site.</p><p><a href="privacyPolicy.do#top">[top]</a> </p>
