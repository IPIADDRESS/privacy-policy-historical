  </p>
  <p>
    You do not have to provide us with your health information, however this means that you may not be eligible to enter some competitions, nor able to receive tailored information specific to your needs.
  </p>
  <h4>User submitted content</h4>
  <p>
    The Website allows you to post and submit content, including photographs and images, height, weight, marital status, age, fitness levels and nutrition details.  You do not need to post or submit any content, however, if you do, we collect the information that you submit.

  </p>

    We collect, hold and use your personal information for a number of purposes, as outlined below:
  Providing services to you and operating the Website
  </p>
  <p>In general, we use the information that we collect to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>assist us in providing goods and services to you;</li>
    <li>contact you or respond to your queries;</li>
    <li>display, update and maintain the content of the Website;</li>
    <li>
      tailor your experience of the Website and our communications to you; and
    </li>

      send information about future events, regular email communications or newsletters (both electronic and hardcopy) outlining news, services or events.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Running Competitions and Promotions</h4>
  <p>
    If we collect information from you as part of any competitions or promotions, we use the information that we collect in profiling your fitness, displaying the results of competitions, promoting the service and encouraging other members of the Website.
  </p>
  <h4>General uses</h4>
  <p>We may also use the information that we collect from you:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      to advertise our services and the Website.  However, we will seek your consent before we use your photograph publicly for this purpose;
    </li>
    <li>
      for our internal administrative, marketing and planning requirements;
    </li>
    <li>
      to compile and report statistics, with all the relevant personal and/or proprietary information de-identified prior to the completion of such statistics; and
    </li>
    <li>
      for purposes that are expressly permitted under any agreement with you.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>2.3 To whom will 12WBT disclose my personal information?</h3>
  <p>
    We generally do not disclose contact information about you publicly or to other third parties by us unless it is authorised or required by law (or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us in relation to the Website) or as otherwise outlined in this policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may display personal information about you (including your health information and your profile photograph) on the Website.  This is for the purposes of publicly profiling your fitness, displaying the results of competitions, promoting our services and Website and encouraging other members.  If you do not wish this to happen, then you must contact us where directed below.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will display your user submitted content as part of the Website.  The Website may include functionalities that allow you to control whether or not the public or other users of the Website are able to view your user submitted content.  We will use reasonable endeavours to implement your selection.
  </p>
  <p>
    From time to time, we will also disclose your personal information (on a confidential basis) to agents and others that we use in the ordinary operation of our business, such as account and billing, shipping and fulfilment, marketing and promotion, user experience research and surveys, website hosting and support and maintenance.  We will only disclose your information to the extent required for the limited purpose of the third party providing services contracted to us so that we may service you.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also disclose aggregated data (in a form that does not identify you individually) to our advisors for the purposes of conducting market and user experience analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    While we store the majority of the personal information that we collect from your in Australia, we may from time to time store some of the information in a computer server located in the United States.  We will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles.
  </p>
  <h3>2.4 Testimonials</h3>
  <p>We publish customer testimonials on our website, in social media profiles, on our Youtube channel and within advertising creative material. These testimonials may contain personally identifiable information. We obtain your written consent at the time the testimonial is recorded. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@12wbt.com">admin@12wbt.com</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>2.5 Manner of collection</h3>
  <p>
    We will use reasonable endeavours to only collect information directly from you.  If you are disclosing details of another person (for example, a minor on whose behalf you are registering), it is your sole responsibility to ensure that that person understands and consents to the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information in the manner set out in this policy.
  </p>
  <h2>3. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY OUR WEBSITE</h2>
  <h3>3.1 Tracking of user experience</h3>
  <p>
    A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies on the Website.  We link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Website.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Website.  A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.  If you reject cookies, you may still use our Website, but your ability to use some areas of our Website may be limited.
  </p>
  <p>
    We, and our third party tracking utilities-partners, employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users on our Website.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on webpages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
  </p>
  <p>
    As is true of most web sites and mobile applications, we and, in some instances, our third party tracking-utility partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
