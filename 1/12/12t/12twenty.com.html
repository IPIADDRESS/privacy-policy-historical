                                            In order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on 12Twenty is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the 12Twenty website. To protect any data you store on our servers, 12Twenty also regularly audits our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to 12Twenty. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, instant messaging, and similar means of communication are generally not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.

                                            Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on 12Twenty. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up-to-date antivirus software.
