<h2>5. How We Protect Information</h2>
<p>In order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on 12Twenty is password-protected, and&nbsp;sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your&nbsp;web browser and the 12Twenty website. To protect any data you store on our servers, 12Twenty also regularly audits&nbsp;our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However,&nbsp;since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you&nbsp;transmit to 12Twenty. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed&nbsp;by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of&nbsp;your login information. Please note that emails, instant messaging, and similar means of communication are generally&nbsp;not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.&nbsp;Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security&nbsp;measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your&nbsp;information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We are not responsible for&nbsp;third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on 12Twenty. You can reduce these risks by&nbsp;using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different&nbsp;services, and using up-to-date antivirus software.</p>
