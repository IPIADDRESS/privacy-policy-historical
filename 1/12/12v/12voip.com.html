	<li>Geographical information –&nbsp;e.g.&nbsp;your geographical location.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<p><b>Why we collect and use personal information.</b></p>

<p>DELLMONT collects, uses and stores your Personal Data in accordance with applicable law and EU directives regarding the Protection of Persons and Personal Data, as modified.</p>

<p>DELLMONT uses your Personal Data for the provision of&nbsp;Services and billing purposes.</p>

<p>DELLMONT may use your Personal Data to improve their&nbsp;Services.</p>

<p>DELLMONT may use your Personal Data to detect misuse of its system and / or a customer account.</p>

<p>DELLMONT may use the Personal Data to provide you with information relating to your account.</p>

<p>DELLMONT may use the Personal Data for marketing purposes, unless you object to this. Thus, you may at any time and without charge, contact DELLMONT to stop any use of your Personal Data for advertising or solicitation purposes.</p>

<p>DELLMONT and any partner involved in providing the&nbsp;Services will store your Personal Data no longer than the time necessary to provide&nbsp;Services and, in any case, no longer than the maximum period permitted by the local laws, rules and regulations on Personal Data protection.</p>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<p><b>Disclosure and sharing of your Personal Data</b></p>

<p>DELLMONT ensures the confidentiality of your Personal Data and will never disclose them to third parties without your consent, apart from the partners involved in providing the&nbsp;Services.</p>

<p>However, these partners involved in providing the&nbsp;Services will only receive the Personal Data required to perform&nbsp;Services. DELLMONT and its partners are prohibited from using your Personal Data for any other purposes.</p>

<p>Your Personal Data can be transmitted and stored in&nbsp;the European Union&nbsp;and in Switzerland, offering an adequate level of protection.</p>

<p>By using the&nbsp;Services provided by DELLMONT, you agree that your Personal Data can be transmitted to partners in Members States of European Union or in countries providing adequate protection for the provision of the&nbsp;Services.</p>

<p>Personal Data may additionally be communicated to any employee of DELLMONT or any partner involved in providing the&nbsp;Services. The communication to these third parties is limited to data necessary for the performance of their tasks for the same purposes as the one of DELLMONT.</p>

&nbsp;

<p><b>Access to your Personal Data</b></p>

<p>You can request free access to your Personal Data processed and stored by DELLMONT in the secure MyAccount section.</p>

&nbsp;

<p><b>You have the following rights:</b></p>

<p>Right of access to your Personal Data: You have the right to ask us for confirmation on whether we are processing your Personal Data, and access to the Personal Data and related information on that processing (e.g., the purposes of the processing, or the categories of Personal Data involved).</p>

<p>Right to correction: You have the right to have your Personal Data corrected, as permitted by law.</p>

<p>Right to erasure: You have the right to ask us to delete your Personal Data, as permitted by law. This right may be exercised among other things: (i) when your Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; (ii) when you withdraw consent on which processing is based and where there is no other legal ground for processing; (iii) when you object to processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or when you object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (2) GDPR; or, (iv) when your Personal Data has been unlawfully processed.</p>

<p>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR): You have the right to request the limiting of our processing under limited circumstances, including: when the accuracy of your Personal Data is contested; when the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your Personal Data and request the restriction of the use of your Personal Data instead; or when you have objected to processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of DELLMONT override your grounds.</p>

<p>Right to data portability: You have the right to receive the Personal Data that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and you have the right to transmit that information to another controller, including to have it transmitted directly, where technically feasible.</p>

<p>Right to object: You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data, as permitted by law. This right is limited to processing based on Art. 6 (1) (e) or (f) GDPR, and includes profiling based on those provisions, and processing for direct marketing purposes. After which, we will no longer process your Personal Data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.,</p>

&nbsp;

<p><b>Data Retention</b></p>

<p>We will retain your Personal Data for as long as you maintain an account or as otherwise necessary to provide you the&nbsp;Services. We will also retain your Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>Where we no longer need to process your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we will delete your Personal Data from our systems.</p>

<p>Where permissible, we will also delete your Personal Data upon your request, after which we may not be able to continue to provide you with the&nbsp;Services. Information on how to make a deletion request can be found by logging into your MyAccount.</p>

&nbsp;

<p><b>Security of your Personal Data</b></p>

<p>DELLMONT uses standard security technologies and procedures to ensure the protection of your Personal Data against unauthorized access, use, disclosure or destruction.</p>

<p>DELLMONT takes security measures, such as technical and organizational measures against unauthorized or unlawful access to your Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to your Personal Data.</p>
