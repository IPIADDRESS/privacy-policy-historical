<div class="articleparagraph section">

<p></p><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Protecting privacy and maintaining the trust of our customers, their students, and parents has always been a key priority for us. To enhance learning, we need access to data, measurement, insight and other feedback that inform us 

about students' knowledge and skill levels and learning development.

</p><ul style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
<li>Our goal is to use data in the course of current learning activities to provide adaptive pathways of learning; not drive commerce.</li>
<li>We want to communicate with parents and schools about the educational benefit of using technology to create a personalized learning path based on past performance, and the need to use student information for educational 

purposes.</li>
<li>We want to build trust about the way we use personally identifiable student data for educational purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>And our commitment to privacy and innovation goes beyond compliance, it's part of our culture:

</p><ul style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
<li>We have implemented policies and procedures around these issues to support schools and institutions in their COPPA and FERPA compliance efforts.</li>

<p></p><li>In 2013, we appointed one of the education industry's first Chief Privacy Officers.</li>

<p></p><li>We've taken a leadership role with Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) in setting the agenda for self-regulatory goals for student privacy in the industry.</li>

<p></p><li>We have an internal Privacy Council comprised of senior leaders throughout our company insuring best practices across our business.</li>

<p></p><li>We do not support business models that create tolls and taxes on interoperability.</li>

<p></p><li>We conduct regular scans of all of our applications to prevent and detect any possible security breaches. We recognize that no system is 100% secure, but do everything we can to prevent and mitigate any impact of adverse 

events.</li>
</ul>

<p>By increasing awareness and transparency, we hope to better understand the concerns and learn how to talk with each other about privacy, security, and confidentiality.

</p><p>Educational institutions are ultimately responsible for providing a full understanding of the privacy practices around how their students' personally identifiable information is collected, shared, and used. To obtain more detailed 

information about how data is collected, used, and shared by an educational institution, please contact the appropriate individual at that institution.

<p><b><i>What is personally identifiable information (PII)?

</i></b></p><p><b><i>Personally Identifiable Information, or PII, is information that can identify you, or when combined with other information can be used to identify you.</i></b>

</p><p>Personally identifiable information, or PII, is information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, or ID numbers. PII also includes information that can be combined to identify you, such as you date of birth and 

birthplace. Any information that is combined with PII, is also considered PII as long as it is linked to PII. For example, we couldn't identify you based on your grade level, however grade level is PII as long as it is connected to you.




</p><hr style="border-top:1px solid #636363;">





<p><b><i>What PII do we collect and how do we use it?

</i></b></p><p><b><i>We collect PII, such as contact information and education details, in order to provide, maintain and improve our products and services.</i></b>

</p><p>We only collect the information we require to provide, maintain and improve the digital learning solution you and your child use. When you and/or your child register, or are registered within one of our digital learning solutions, we 

typically only collect your name, school, instructor, class, and login information. However, once you begin using one of our solutions, we collect your input to questions, technical specifications, and other information about how you use 

the solution. As mentioned above, we use this information to provide you and your child with the solution, as well as maintain and improve the solution.




</p><hr style="border-top:1px solid #636363;">

address, operating systems, pages viewed, and time spent. This information is also used to enable the functions of the digital learning system, as well as customize, maintain, and improve our digital learning systems. You may disable

If you are under 18, we suggest that you review this information with your parents. Your school is ultimately responsible for your information, so we encourage you to reach out to your school if you have any questions or concerns about 

your privacy. Should the below information change, we will update it here, but more importantly, we will notify your school in writing and obtain their consent before implementing any new practices that affect your privacy beyond what is 

described.

</p><p>This information applies to all students who use our digital learning system. Educational institutions are best able to provide you with a full understanding of their privacy practices and more information on how their students' PII 

is collected, shared, and used. To obtain more detailed information about how PII is collected, used, and shared by or on behalf of an educational institution, please contact the appropriate individual at that institution.
