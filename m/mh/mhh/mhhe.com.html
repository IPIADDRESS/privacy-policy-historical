<h2><center>The McGraw-Hill Companies Customer Privacy Policy</center></h2>

<p></p><hr align="LEFT"><p></p>

<p>The McGraw-Hill Companies recognizes the importance of protecting the
privacy of Personally-Identifiable Information collected about you, our
customers and prospects. Personally-Identifiable Information includes your
e-mail address, employment status, and "click stream" data which
tracks how you use an online service. We have adopted a corporate-wide Customer
Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store and use this Personally-Identifiable
Information about our customers and prospects. Our intent is to balance
our legitimate business interests in collecting and using this Information
against your reasonable expectations of privacy. This Policy includes the
following:</p>

<p><b>1. Notice.</b> We will notify you as to the types of Personally-Identifiable-Information
we are collecting about you as well as the uses we intend to make of that
Information. For example, we need to collect and store your name, address,
and other basic Personally-Identifiable Information to provide you with
the service or product you requested and for billing purposes. This Information
also enables us to develop and customize products to better meet your needs
and preferences and to offer you products from both The McGraw-Hill Companies
and other sources that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p><b>2. Collection and Security.</b> We will only collect this type of
Personally Identifiable Information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary
to serve our legitimate business purposes and we will maintain appropriate
safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the Information.</p>

<p><b>3. Opt-Out.</b> From time to time, we are approached by companies
and organizations that produce a product or service that we believe may
be of interest to you. We see this as a value-added service helping you
to find products or services to help you work or play smarter. We will offer
you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your Personally-Identifiable
Information shared with parties outside of The McGraw-Hill Companies.</p>

<p><b>4. Sensitive Data.</b> If your relationship with us includes providing
one of the Corporation's business units with Personally-Identifiable Information
which is particularly "Sensitive", we will protect that information
with extra care. We define Sensitive Data as including Social Security numbers,
mother's maiden name, personal financial data such as salary-specific information,
specific stock holdings and net worth, information regarding someone's specific
medical condition and most information about children. There will be no
external distribution of this Sensitive Data outside of The McGraw-Hill
Companies. In addition, you may "opt out" of having this information
shared among business units within the family of The McGraw-Hill Companies.</p>

<p><b>5. Questions and Concerns?</b> Each business unit is in the process
of designating someone to implement privacy protection for that unit's customers
and prospects. You soon will find a contact name listed on each Web site
and in many of our print products.</p>

<p><b>6. Review and Correction.</b> In the near future, you will be able
to request a copy of the Personally-Identifiable Information a business
unit has collected about you, and request changes if you find it inaccurate.</p><p>
