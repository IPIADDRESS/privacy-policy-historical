			<h3 align="left">Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This Web site is the responsibility 
			of NicheInvestments.com and it's affiliated websites (the 
			"Company"). The Company can be contacted by mail, by phone, or by 
			e-mail. The following policies apply to the Web Site having the URL 
			http://www.NicheInvestments.com or all affiliated sites in the Niche 
			Investment Network that is owned and operated by the Company.</font> </p>
			<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1. Collection of 
			Personal Information from Site Visitors</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Company automatically collects 
			and/or tracks the following: (1) the home server domain names, IP 
			addresses, type of client computer, and type of Web browser of 
			visitors to the Company's web site, (2) the e-mail addresses of 
			visitors that communicate with the Company via e-mail, post messages 
			to the Company's bulletin boards, or post messages to the Company's 
			chat groups, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in 
			online forms, registrations forms, surveys, and contest entries, and 
			(4) aggregate and/or user-specific information on what pages are 
			visited within the Company's Web site.</font> </p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Company may from time to time 
			place Internet "cookies" on visitors' hard drives. Internet cookies 
			contain identifying information about the user that can only be 
			accessed by The Company's servers. When the visitor revisits the 
			Company's Web site, the Company will recognize the visitor by the 
			Internet cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly. 
			Internet cookies are stored on the visitor's hard drive and are not 
			stored, in any form, by the Company. Visitors may decline the 
			Internet cookie by using the appropriate feature of their Web client 
			software, if available.</font> </p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When a visitor performs a search on 
			the Company's search engine, the Company records information 
			identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search 
			performed. As necessary to provide service, the Company does record 
			limited information for every search request and uses that 
			information only to solve technical problems with the service and to 
			calculate overall usage statistics.</font></p>
			<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>2. Use of Personal 
			Data Collected</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Company's registration form 
			requires users to give us contact information (such as their name 
			and e-mail addresses), financial information (such as their account 
			or credit card numbers), and demographic information (such as their 
			zip code, age, or income level). The Company uses customer contact 
			information from the registration form to send the user information 
			about the Company and promotional material from some of the 
			Company's partners. The customer's contact information is also used 
			to contact the visitor when necessary and shared with other 
			companies who may want to contact the Company's visitors. Users may 
			opt-out of receiving future mailings. Financial information that is 
			collected is used to check the users' qualifications for use of the 
			various services offered by the Company, to bill the user for 
			products and services, and for other purposes. Demographic and 
			profile data is also collected by the Company. The Company uses this 
			data for other purposes. Personal data collected by the Company will 
			be used by the Company for editorial and feedback purposes, for 
			marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of 
			users' behavior, for product and services development, for content 
			improvement, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen 
			or clicked on their advertisements, and to customize content and 
			layout of the Company's Web site. Data on visitors' home servers is 
			aggregated for internal review and then discarded. Names, postal and 
			e-mail addresses, and phone numbers collected may be added to the 
			Company's databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding 
			site updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and status 
			of orders placed online.</font></p>
			<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>3. Disclosure of 
			Data to Third Parties</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In connection with the utilization of 
			the Company's Listing Services, user's contact information (name, 
			address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail) will be provided on 
			the Company's Web Site. Any third party other than these users to 
			which the Company shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses 
			personal data of subscribers to its services will be carefully 
			pre-screened by the Company, determined by the Company to be 
			reputable, and will use the personal data for marketing products and 
			services which the Company determines, in its sole judgment, that 
			visitors might find of interest.</font></p>
			<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>4. Opt-Out Right</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Visitors may opt out of having their 
			personal information collected by the Company, used by the Company 
			for secondary purposes, disclosed to third parties, or used by the 
			Company or third parties to send promotional correspondence to the 
			visitor, by contacting the Company via postal mail, e-mail, or 
			telephone, or by checking the appropriate box on the online forms. 
			However, if the Company has provided a user's information to a Third 
			Party, and subsequently receives an "opt-out" request from a user, 
			it will cease its own contact with the user but may not be able to 
			cause the Third Party(s) to stop its contact.</font></p>
			<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>5. Access to and 
			Ability to Correct Personal Data</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Upon request via postal mail, e-mail, 
			or phone, the Company will provide to visitors a summary of any 
			personal information retained by the Company regarding the visitor. 
			Visitors may modify, correct, change, or update their personal 
			record or cause their personal record to be removed from the 
			Company's database. The Company will only send personal records to 
			the e-mail address on file for the visitor name associated with it.</font></p>
			<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>6. Collection of 
			Personal Data from Children</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Company will not collect or post 
			information from children. The Company's Web Site is designed for 
			adults over eighteen (18) years of age.</font></p>
			<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>7. The Company's 
			Right to Contact the User</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Company reserves the right to 
			contact site visitors regarding account status and changes to the 
			membership services agreement, privacy policy, or any other policies 
			or agreements relevant to site visitors.</font></p>
			<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>8. The Company's 
			Right to Change Privacy Policy</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Company reserves the right to 
			change this policy at any time by notifying visitors of the 
			existence and location of the new or revised privacy policy.</font></p>
