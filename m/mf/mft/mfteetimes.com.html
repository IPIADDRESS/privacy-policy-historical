						<!-- CONTENT ================================================================================================== -->
						<h1 class="paneltitle" style="font-size: 2em;margin-bottom: 30px;">MembersFirst Inc. Privacy Statement</h1>
						

						<p>MembersFirst is committed to respecting the privacy of both our clients (generally, member-based organizations such as clubs, associations, and churches) and other users of our software (generally, members of a client's organization). Any personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be directly identified) that we collect will only be used to support user relationships with their member-based organization and client relationships with MembersFirst.</p>

						<p>We do not sell this information to 3rd parties. In the event that MembersFirst is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Statement will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>


						<h3>Awareness</h3>
						<p>MembersFirst provides this Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way information about you or your use of our software and websites is used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available from the bottom of every MembersFirst client webpage and every page on MembersFirst.com.</p>

						<p>With ever-evolving technology and the changing needs of our clients and their members, this Privacy Statement may be updated from time to time without notice. We will notify clients about significant changes by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in their MembersFirst account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p>


						<h3>Data Security</h3>
						<p>MembersFirst is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we receive online.</p>

						<p>MembersFirst makes a serious effort to keep our systems safe and secure from unauthorized access, including offering encrypted communications for nearly all software and services. As covered in MembersFirst's Terms of Use, you are responsible for reporting unauthorized use of your account and are restricted from behaviors that may damage the security of our websites and/or software or that conflict with this Privacy Statement or the Terms of Use.</p>

						
						<h3>Data We Receive + How We Use It</h3>
						<p>There are two kinds of data we receive; Personally Identifiable Information (PII), that is, information or a collection of information in which you can be identified, and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Anonymous or Non-PII), that is, information that is not connected to information in which you can be individually identified.</p>

						<p>In general, Anonymous Information is used to better understand user behaviors to improve our services and to improve marketing efforts, while PII is used to provide a service to you, respond to your requests, to keep you informed regarding your relationship with MembersFirst and/or your member organization, and to personalize our websites and services to you.</p>

						<p>When using any of our websites or web-based applications you can expect the collection and storage of your information on USA-based servers and in and any other country where MembersFirst or its member entities and/or business partners operate.</p>

						<p>On some web pages you can make requests or register to receive materials from MembersFirst or our Clients. The types of PII recieved from these pages generally include contact information, interests, and demographic information. There are other ways you may volunteer this information such as providing it over the phone, in writing, and via email.</p>

						<p>If you are employed by a Client of MembersFirst and/or have an Administrative User Account, we may use your PII to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving direct marketing, and we will not send unsolicited mass emails.</p>

						<p>Like nearly all service-based websites, MembersFirst uses "cookies" to improve your experience and support various interactive features. A cookie is a file containing a string of code stored by your web browser for later reference. For example, with cookies saved by your browser, our system can recognize you when returning to one of our sites so as to present you with personalized content. If you choose not to take advantage of these kinds of features, you can set up your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie has been sent. Many features cannot function without the use of cookies.</p>

						<p>When visiting one of our sites your computer may also receive cookies from third parties or from our clients. These cookies are covered by the additional policies of the specific website you are visiting and not this policy.</p>

						<p>We also use "pixel tags" (also known as "web beacons, "action tags", and "single pixel gifs") in some web pages and emails to determine when a user views that piece of content. No PII is transmitted through pixel tags, but the information may later be combined with PII in our database in order to confirm if you successfully received an e-mail or other important message.</p>	

						<p>MembersFirst products, services, and websites use Google Analytics to analyze site traffic and trends, user behavior, and user characteristics. The information (including your IP address) stored in the Google Analytics cookie about your use of the website is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the site and to compile statistical reports on website activity in conjunction with Google's inferred Demographics and Interest Reporting.</p>

						<p>Non-PII about users may also be used for online marketing purposes by MembersFirst or our Clients. For example, MembersFirst may use Display Advertising and Remarketing services from Google to show ads about MembersFirst products and services on other websites after a user visits the MembersFirst website. We may also utilize behavior tracking tools such as heat maps from clicks on a website to identify and fix poorly performing aspects of the site.</p>

						<p>Users can control and opt out of this kind of reporting by changing <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">their privacy settings with Google.</a> Google Analytics will not collect or send PII to Google, however, MembersFirst or a client may be able to identify individuals by cross-referencing data from Analytics with their own private database, or through the MembersFirst User Audit Tracking feature of their website. This is typically done to ensure any particular user completed a neccessary action on the website, such as participating in a proxy vote, reading board minutes, or aggreeing to updated member terms.</p>

						<p>For the entire privacy policy regarding information collected within Google Analytics please view the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Google Analytics Privacy Overview</a>.</p>
						


						<h3>Who We Share It With</h3>
						
						<p>MembersFirst will not sell, rent, or lease your PII to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the PII you provide online with other member entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf to complete the activities described above. Such member entities and/or business partners, including those located in other countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data. </p>

						<p>In general, we provide access to your personal information only to employees and contractors we believe need that access in order to do their jobs and to provide products or services to you. </p>

						<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Statement, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect MembersFirst's rights or property. However, nothing in this Online Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>


						

						<h3>Children</h3>
						<p>MembersFirst needs to ask all users, including children under age 13, for personal information that is reasonably necessary to determine the user's eligibility to use some features or services. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, many of the website's interactive services are only available to users and members who are at least thirteen years old. If you are under thirteen, you may not have access to many features nor your own user account.</p>

						<p>If you become aware that a child has created a user account, please contact us so that we may take steps to remove their information and terminate the child's user account. </p>



						<h3>Choice</h3>
						<p>MembersFirst will not use or share the PII provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we will do everything we can to honor such requests.</p>

						<p>As a client or member of a client, we reserve the right to send you certain important communications relating to our services, such as service announcements and administrative messages throughout the term of your MembersFirst account without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving those communications.</p>		


						<h3>Additional Information</h3>
						<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, you can contact <a href="mailto:support@membersfirst.com">support@membersfirst.com</a>.</p>
