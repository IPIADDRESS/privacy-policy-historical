<h3>What Information Does Mr Feature Collect From You?</h3>

<p>Whenever you visit Mr Feature , our web server logs automatically receive and record anonymous information from your web browser including your IP Address, Mr Featurecookie information, the Mr Feature page(s) you request, the time spent on each web page and any search terms you query.</p>
<p>Mr Feature uses this anonymous information to customize your experience on our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages, and to improve our services in general.

<p>The Mr Feature website is constantly evolving and changing in content and in features. Member Information helps guide such changes and the evolution of our websites. Our advertisers and affiliates may be provided general information or data regarding membership usage patterns or interests, so that they too can better serve your needs and preferences, but such disclosure will not include individually identifiable information. The collection of usage and interest information allows us to provide a constantly evolving and user-sensitive package of services, products, and features that satisfy member needs, wants and desires but always with the priority of protecting individual member privacy.</p>
<h3>Do Any Third Parties Receive or Collect Your Information Through Mr Feature?</h3>

Unless we tell you otherwise, these third parties do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to deliver your requested product or service; or </p>
<p>We are responding to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or- </p>

<p>Mr Feature nor is it personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>None if these third parties nor any other advertiser or advertising service, receives personally identifiable information from Mr Feature .

<p>Mr Feature updates this policy from time to time. If we are going to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our databases, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. Bear in mind that the only way to ensure your personal privacy whenever you are on the Internet is to make sure your browser is configured so that you are alerted to all cookies.</p>
