<h2><privacy policy<="" h2="">
	<div style="text-align:left">	
<p>MrWhat.is (“MrWhat”) operates the MrWhat.is. It is MrWhat’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<h2>Website Visitors</h2>

<p>Like most website operators, MrWhat collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MrWhat’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MrWhat’s visitors use its website. From time to time, MrWhat may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>MrWhat also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. MrWhat does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Certain visitors to MrWhat’s websites choose to interact with MrWhat in ways that require MrWhat to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MrWhat gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we may in the future require users who wish to sign up for an Account with MrWhat.is to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with MrWhat are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, MrWhat collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with MrWhat. MrWhat does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

<p>MrWhat may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, MrWhat may monitor the most popular searches on MrWhat.is. MrWhat may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, MrWhat does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>MrWhat discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MrWhat’s behalf or to provide services available at MrWhat’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using MrWhat’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. MrWhat will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, MrWhat discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when MrWhat believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MrWhat, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an MrWhat website and have supplied your email address, MrWhat may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with MrWhat and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MrWhat takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. MrWhat uses cookies to help MrWhat identify and track visitors, their usage of MrWhat website, and their website access preferences. MrWhat visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using MrWhat’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of MrWhat’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, MrWhat may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in MrWhat’s sole discretion. MrWhat encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a wordpress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
