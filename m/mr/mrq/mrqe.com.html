The expansion and penetration of the Internet into our daily lives has
yielded dramatic benefits, and potential risks.  The abuse of user
tracking and customization can result in the invasion of surfers'
privacy and confidentiality.  Further, privacy rights in the
information age is a personal concern of the MRQE publisher.  This
assurance notwithstanding, let the following statement serve as
MRQE's privacy policy statement.

All visitors to MRQE retain complete anonymity by default.  As pages
are delivered, MRQE does not acquire or collect any personal
information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email
address all remain your private properties. MRQE does, however,
collect information which is specific to the technical details of your
arrival at the site.  Our web servers may note non-personally
identifying details such as, but not limited to, your computer's IP
address and operating and windowing systems, the type of browser you
use, and your language preferences.  This information is collected
solely for customizing the pages delivered to you (minor differences
for Unix/X vs. MS Windows users, for instance) and for estimating 
<a href="/stats/">site popularity</a>.

<p>

There are instances where a visitor may provide specific personal
information in response to a survey, or as part of a future optional
user customization process.  For surveys, MRQE (or a third party
working in conjunction with MRQE) acquires this information to help
with the marketing of the web site, or to assist in the building of a
<a href="/survey/survey.html">demographic profile</a>
with the purpose of attracting appropriate
advertisers.  In such cases, the privacy policy statement of this
third party will be made available.  Any potential user
customization would be, of course, optional, and the information
collected would serve to improve the quality of the visitor's
experience.

The privacy policy statement of our primary advertising broker,
BURST!, is available <a href="http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp">

MRQE collects statistics on what titles its visitors are looking up,
and -- with the intent of gauging reviewer popularity -- plans to soon do
the same for the off-site links that are followed.  Any tracking of
individual user's actions is intended for customization purposes only,
and will never be shared with third parties.  Aggregate
(non-personal) statistics may be displayed on MRQE pages (<em>e.g.,</em>
the <a href="/lookup?special=fav12">Most Popular Titles pages</a>)
or shared with third parties.

MRQE may soon begin issuing cookies for two reasons: 1) to assist in
the estimating the extent of MRQE's popularity, and 2) to allow for
user customization of the MRQE experience.  We understand that some
people are not comfortable with cookies and have customized their
browsers to never accept them.  For that reason (and browser
compatibility), we will never require that one accept cookies to enjoy
