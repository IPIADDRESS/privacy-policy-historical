            <h1>Mr. Skin Privacy Policy</h1>
<small class="muted">Effective Date: September 1, 2012</small>

<div class="well">
  <p>At MrSkin.com, a site operated by SK Intertainment, Inc./SK Europe BV, we are committed to protecting your privacy online. We are also committed to providing you with the very best experience we can on our website. In order to do so, we may gather certain personal information about you. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our website. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.</p> 

  <h3>What information does MrSkin.com collect?</h3>
  <p>When you visit the MrSkin.com site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited, types of products purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.</p>
  <p>When you sign up with us or become a Mr. Skin member, you may be asked to provide the following personal information to us or one of our third-party processors:</p>
  <ul class="unstyled">
      <li>First and last name</li>
      <li>Billing address</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Phone number</li>
      <li>Credit card account number</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter promotions or contests, and when you respond to a survey.</p>

  <h3>What do we do with the information we collect? </h3>
  <p>We use the information that we collect to provide our services, to contact you regarding new offers, and for advertising purposes. We also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the services that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. When we send you emails that include a link to the MrSkin.com site, that link may contain an alphanumeric identifier that allows us to identify the person to whom we sent the message so that we can personalize our content for that individual.  If we ever send you emails concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an email address by which you may opt out of receiving such emails.</p>

  <h3>With whom do we share your information and for what purpose?</h3>
  <p>The information we collect may also be sold, licensed, transferred, rebranded, updated, appended and/or shared with individuals and companies engaged in the sales, marketing, advertising, and publishing industries for various products and services in which you may be interested.  When one or more of our business partners co-sponsor a service, promotion and/or contest, we may share some or all of the information collected in connection with such service, promotion or contest with the co-sponsor(s).</p> 
  <p>We may also share aggregate user information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to users more targeted advertising, products and services.</p>  
  <p>We may contract with third parties to conduct research and marketing on our behalf.  Such third parties will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Mr. Skin and may not use any personally-identifiable information provided by us other than as expressly instructed by us and in strict compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect from you with outside records (e.g., information we obtain from other companies, including wireless providers) to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. To fulfill your requests for products and services (e.g., provide you with content via your mobile phone), we may share the personally identifiable information you provide with your mobile phone service provider or their partner and subcontractor companies. Our privacy policy does not cover such entities’ use of information. To learn more about your provider's privacy practices, you should consult its privacy policy.</p> 

  <h3>What information do parties other than Mr. Skin collect?</h3> 
  <p>In addition to our credit card processors, some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you when you access or utilize those links. Mr. Skin does not control the collection or use of such information, and the practices of those advertisers and websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p> 

  <h3>What are cookies and how do we use them?</h3>
  <p>Our site may use cookies to speed navigation, keep track of items, and provide you with custom-tailored content. We also use cookies to remember information you gave us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the site. By showing us how and when members and shoppers use the site, cookies also help us see which areas are popular and which are not. We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our sponsors and advertisers.   Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own cookies.</p> 
  <p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. You will not be able to log in, view clips or order from MrSkin.com if you turn off the cookies option.</p>

  <h3>Credit card processing and security</h3>
  <p>Credit card security is an important aspect of the online experience. In order to keep your credit card information safe, your ordering information -- including your name, address, and credit card number -- is encrypted using a secure server, so that your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system.</p> 
  <p>Credit-card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution or Gateway processor, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions. We also offer other payment options via our join page and as a last resort you can pay by certified check and send it by mail to us.  Please contact Customer Support for how to proceed using certified checks.</p>

  <h3>Cooperation with law enforcement</h3>
  <p>MrSkin.com fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to release information about members who we believe are in violation of applicable laws or regulations. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful.</p> 

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>MrSkin.com member accounts are secured by member-created passwords. MrSkin.com takes precautions to ensure that member account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of our member information at any time.</p>

  <h3>Users Located Outside of the United States</h3>
  <p>We make an effort to protect the personal information of all users of mrskin.com.  If you are unsure whether this privacy policy is in conflict with the rules applicable where you are located, you should not submit your personal information to mrskin.com. <strong>IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS OF WHICH MAY BE DEEMED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION.</strong> Users of mrskin.com located in countries outside of the United States who submit personal information do thereby consent to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of the information in the United States.</p>

  <h3>COPPA compliance</h3>
  <p>Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults.  We have designed this privacy policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). We will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.</p>
  <p>If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to us, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived in web logs and back-up archives after we delete the information from its active database.</p>
  <p>We believe that parents should supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.</p>

  <h3>California User Consumer Rights.</h3>
  <p>In accordance with California Civil Code Sec. 1789.3, California resident users are entitled to know that they may file grievances and complaints with California Department of Consumer Affairs, 400 R Street, STE1080, Sacramento, CA 95814; or by phone at 916-445-1254 or 800-952-5210; or by email to dca@dca.ca.gov. For more information about protecting your privacy, you may wish to visit:</p>

  <h3>Business transitions&nbsp;</h3>
  <p>In the event MrSkin.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>

It is your responsibility to check this page periodically.</p>
