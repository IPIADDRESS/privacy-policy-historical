		We take seriously your interest in how your information is collected and used. Please read the following to understand about our privacy practices.	
	</p> <p>
		This Privacy Notice discloses the privacy practices of our websites, whether accessed through a computer, tablet, smartphone or other device (individually or 
		collectively, “Device” or “Devices”), and our Apps. Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using our Websites or 
		Apps (collectively, “Services”) or other websites, and the ways in which we use and share this information. This Privacy Notice does not apply to any information you 
		may provide to us, or that we may collect, offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail). In addition, this 
		Privacy Notice does not apply to our non-digital products and services. Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. By using the Services, you agree that your use of 
		our Services, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Notice and our <a href="index.php?a=28&amp;b=140">Terms of Service</a>. 
		Because the web and apps are evolving media, we may need to change our Privacy Notice at some point in the future. If we make a significant change in the way we 
		collect, use or share your information, the change will be posted days before the change takes effect. By continuing to use the Services after we post any such 
		changes, you accept the Privacy Notice as modified. Your access of the Services for the limited and exclusive purpose of reviewing this Privacy Notice does not 
		constitute your acceptance of this Privacy Notice unless you make any further use or access of our Services. 
	</p> <h3>
		SUMMARY
	</h3> <p>
		Collection. We collect information that you give us and information that is automatically collected. 	
	</p> <p>
		Use. We use the information for the purpose you gave it to us (for example, to register or make a purchase); to provide content and advertising; to contact you; and 
		for other purposes.
	</p> <p>
		Share. We share the information with our service providers and affiliates to administer the Services; to provide content for the Services; to provide advertising on 
		the Services; and for other purposes. We also share the information with other third parties to provide advertising on the Services, on other sites and apps, and 
		for other purposes.
	</p> <h3>
		Please read the rest of this notice for complete details.
	</h3> <h3>
		How We Collect Information
	</h3> <p>
		The information that we collect about you while you are using our Services falls into two general categories: information you provide to us, and information that is 
		automatically collected. All of the information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a vendor providing contractual services to us, 
		such as a service provider. 
	</p> <p> <b>1. Information You Provide to Us. </b>
		We may collect and store information that you voluntarily supply to us while using our Services, including information you send to us by email or other platforms in 
		connection with a feature provided through the Services. This may include information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name, email address, 
		postal address, telephone numbers, birthdate and gender. Some examples of this type of information include: 
	</p><li>
		information that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions or participate in contests, surveys or sweepstakes; 
	</li> <li>
		information that you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas accessed through our Services; 
	</li> <li>
		information and content you provide when you upload a photograph, video or audio file;
	</li> <li>
		information that you electronically submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Services; 
	</li> <li>
		information that you provide within an advertisement on one of our Services; and 

	</li> <li>
		information contained in search requests that you submit through our Services. 
	</li> <p></p> <p>
		
		We also may ask for information (including a credit card number and other financial information) from those users who make purchases or have payment transactions 
		through our Services.
	</p> <p> <b>2. Information that is Automatically Collected. </b>
		We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you use our Services. Some examples of this type of information include: 	
	</p><li>
		whether you downloaded an App; 
	</li> <li>
		the source of the download of the App (for example, through a particular advertisement for the App);
	</li> <li>
		your Device’s connection to the Internet;
	</li> <li>			
		your browser or operating system; which pages you visit through our Services and how often; 
	</li> <li>
		which features of our Services you interact with and how often; 
	</li> <li>
		which advertisements we serve to you and your engagement with them; and 
	</li> <li>
		information generated when you upload a photograph, video or audio file. 
	</li> <p></p> <p>
		
		In addition, certain Devices and browsers contain unique identifiers that can be used to identify other information about your Device. When you use such a Device or 
		browser to access our Services, your Device and/or your browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your Device's unique identifier, IP address, MAC 
		address, profile information (if you connect through a social network such as Facebook), location information, the make and model of your Device, the wireless 
		provider associated with your Device, and similar information. We may ask you whether we may access and collect your location information even when you are not 
		using the Services, but you may decline this request. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience 
		with our Services. Cookies are small files that your web browser or an App places on your Device for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors 
		use the Services or other websites, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They 
		also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences for certain Services when you have entered preference information before. We also may use web beacons 
		(single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who use the Services or other websites. Additionally, we may 
		assign an anonymous identifier to the tracking pixel or session cookie.
			
	</p> <p>
		We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the 
		cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these 
		technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and 
		settings (see below). The method for disabling local storage will vary depending on your browser and device. 
	</p> <p> <b>3. Your Choices. </b>
		When we request information from you through our Services, you may always choose not to provide us with that information. But if you decline to supply or provide us 
		with certain information while using our Services, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through our Services. 
	</p> <p>
		If you want to limit the information that is automatically collected while you use our Services or other websites, most web browsers allow you to disable certain 
		functionality or set certain privacy settings. If you choose to disable cookies or turn off other functionality, you may not be able to use or participate in some 
		or all of the features offered through the Services. 
			
	</p> <p>
		You can stop all future collection of information by the Apps by uninstalling the Apps according to the procedures outlined in the Apps or on your Device.
	</p> <p> <b>4. Collection of Information by Service Providers and Third-Party Advertising Service Providers. </b>
		In addition, our service providers and third-party advertising service providers may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect the 
		information listed above from our Services. The data collected in connection with the ad serving and ad targeting through our Services does not include your name, 
		postal address, email address, telephone number, birthdate or gender unless you affirmatively provide information within the ad. However, it may include Device 
		identifying information such as the IP address, MAC address, cookie or other Device-specific unique ID. These service providers also may assign an anonymous 
		identifier to the tracking pixel or session cookie. The collection of information by our service providers and third-party advertising service providers is governed 
		by their relevant privacy notices, for which we have no responsibility or liability, and are not covered by our Privacy Notice. If you have any questions regarding 
		the privacy notice of one of our service providers, you should contact the service provider directly for more information. 
	</p> <p>
		If you would like more information about the information collection practices of a particular third-party advertising service provider, or if you would like more 
		information on how to opt out of a third-party advertising service provider’s information collection practices, go to www.aboutads.info, or for apps, at 
		www.aboutads.info/appchoices. Additionally, some of our third-party advertising service providers are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). 
		You can obtain more information about these third-party advertising service providers' information collection practices, and opt out of such practices (and at the 
		same time opt out of the collection practices of other, or all, NAI members) by following the opt out instructions on the NAI's website at 
		http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
	</p> <h3>
		How We Use Information 
	</h3> <p>
		We may use the information we collect from you while you are using the Services for any purpose related to the Services and in a variety of other ways, including, 
		for example:

	</p> <li>
		for the purpose for which the information was submitted;
	</li> <li>
		to process your registration requests;
	</li> <li>

	</li> <li>
		to measure and analyze user interests, behavior, trends and traffic patterns;
	</li> <li>
		to protect the rights of the Services and others or to comply with applicable law; and
	</li> <li>
		to improve the features offered via the Services.
	</li> <p>
		We may use location information, either information you provided by you or information automatically collected, in order to provide you with location-based content, 
		interest-based content services and advertising. We also may combine information we collect from you while you are using our Services with information that we 
		collect from other sources, including other websites or apps, to customize features, content and advertising that appear through our Services.
	</p> <p>
		For more information on how service providers, third-party advertising service providers, affiliates, third parties and advertisers use information, please refer 
		to the next section. 
	</p> <h3>
		How We Share Information
	</h3> <p> <b>Sharing for Services Administration. </b>
		We may provide your information to our affiliates or to service providers for purposes related to Services administration. If you use a credit or debit card to 
		complete a transaction through our Services, we may share your personal information and credit card number with a credit card processing and/or a fulfillment 
		company in order to complete your transaction, or such service provider(s) may collect that information from you directly, on our behalf. 
	</p> <p> <b>Sharing for Additional Content, Products and Services. </b>
		We also make some content, products and services available through cooperative relationships with service providers, where the brands of our service provider 
		appear in connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share with our service provider any information you provide, or that is collected, in the 
		course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our service provider.
