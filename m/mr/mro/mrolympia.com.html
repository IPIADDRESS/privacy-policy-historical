                    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="/2008/mailto:webmaster@amilink.com">webmaster@amilink.com</a></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Children Under 13:</span><br>
                      WIN   cares about the safety of children. Since our content and services are not   directed towards kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register with our   website or to participate in public posting areas on our site. As a reminder,   children should always get permission from their parents before sending any   information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone   numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Information We Collect:</span><br>
                      Generally, the information we gather on our website   falls into two categories: (1) information you supply when you sign up for our   product offerings, participate in sweepstakes, contests, surveys and promotions,   or send us correspondence, and (2) tracking information collected as you   navigate through our site. Third-party providers featured on or linked to our   website, such as vendors of products and services offered through our site, may   gather the same kinds of information about you.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><em><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u></em><br>
                        We may ask you for   personal information when you sign up for products and/or services, complete a   survey, or report a problem with our site. Generally, we use this information to   communicate with you, process your orders and to help improve our site.</p>
                      <p>From time to time, we also may offer contests or other promotions involving   marketing or advertising partners. If you choose to participate in one of these   contests or promotions, you'll have to provide some information about yourself   (such as name, address, and email address). Generally, we use this information   to verify eligibility and to notify winners. We may share this information with   co-sponsors of the contest or other promotional partners, but we will always   identify that another party is involved. We don't control these third parties'   privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection and   use of personal information. We urge you to review their privacy policies and   learn how they will use the information before participating. If you don't want   us to collect the information requested in the promotion, or to provide it to   our co-sponsors or partners, please do not participate in the contest or   promotion.</p>
                      <p>When you use our site, we may also collect your browser type, access time,   and/or Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and keep records of this information.   Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet   to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can   be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. Like the IP   address, none of this other information identifies you personally either; we   collect it for aggregate reporting on site activity that we, and our   advertisers, may use. For example, we may want to know how long the average user   spends on our site, which pages or features get the most attention, and the   like. The aggregate information helps to understand our audience and confirm the   value of the advertising on our website.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">How Your Information Will Be Used:</span><br>
                      Among our primary goals in collecting information is to   provide you with a customized experience when visiting our site and to make our   site more valuable to you. We try to ensure that the banner advertisements we   deliver to you are consistent with your interests. We may also email you with   messages and advertising that we think may be of interest to you. </p>
                    <p>To make your online experience more useful and enjoyable, our site includes   links to other websites, and provides access to products and services offered by   third parties. We share with these third parties such information as is   necessary to provide the products or services. <em>We will not provide your email   address to such third parties unless it's necessary to provide services you have   requested, or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored promotion.</em> We   also may provide links to other websites, and provide access to products and   services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control.   When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct   other transactions through our website, use of any information you provide is   governed by the privacy policy and practices of the operator of the site you're   visiting or the provider of such products or services. When you provide   information in the course of obtaining products or services through our site,   use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy and   practices of the provider of those products or services, even if it appears that   you're on our site throughout the transaction. The provider's privacy policy and   practices may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of   our provider partners via a link either from the site's homepage or from the   pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the   provider directly for more information.</p>
                    <p>We may disclose your personal information when we believe disclosure is (i)   required by law or necessary for compliance with legal process, or necessary, in   our good faith belief, in order to conform with the edicts of the law or comply   with legal process; (ii) necessary to enforce our Visitor   Agreement or other agreements between you and us; (iii) necessary to protect   the rights, safety or interests of other visitors of our site or other members   of the public; and/or (iv) necessary to protect the rights or interests of WIN   or its partners, sponsors or affiliates. As our business grows, we may buy or   sell various assets. In the event that WIN (or a significant portion of our   stock), or our assets or our site (or a significant portion thereof) is acquired   by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred   assets. We may also disclose aggregate information to companies that provide us   with financing, technology, and corporate, financial and legal advice, as well   as to our partners and visitors. You acknowledge and agree to disclosure in each   of the foregoing circumstances. </p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Security:</span><br>
                      The personally   identifiable information we collect is securely stored within our database, and   we use standard, industry-wide procedures such as encryption, firewalls and SSL   (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information. However, as effective as   encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot   guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information   you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.   And, of course, any information you include in a message you post to any message   board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our sites is available   to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to know your name or   email address, for example, make sure not to include it in any message you post   publicly. Please see our Visitor Agreement (need link to Visitor Agreement here)   for more information related to posting materials on our site, including our use   of such materials. </p>
                    <p><strong>Unauthorized Use/Hacking:</strong><br>
                      WIN's website and   system are made available for lawful activities by authorized users only. Any   person using the site without authority or for any unlawful activity are subject   to having his or her activities monitored, recorded, investigated, examined   and/or disclosed by or to WIN and its agents, and law enforcement. WIN may also   monitor and record the activities of authorized users. Any information so   recorded may be disclosed in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy   Policy.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Miscellaneous:</span><br>
                      The Internet is   an evolving medium. Accordingly, WIN reserves the right to change this Privacy   Policy. If we need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future,   we'll post the changes or an amended Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the   site or any of the services offered therein following any such posting will   constitute your acceptance of all changes. In addition, by visiting any of our   sites, you agree that your visit, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by   this Privacy Policy. Please read both carefully before using or registering with   any of our sites.</p>
