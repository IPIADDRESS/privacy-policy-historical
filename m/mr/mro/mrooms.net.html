<p>Effective Date 1st April, 2014</p>
<p>I. PURPOSE<br>
As part of Moodlerooms’ commitment to protect personal privacy, Moodlerooms adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles, administered by the United States Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission with respect to client personal information. Moodlerooms has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Moodlerooms’ certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>
<p>II. SCOPE<br>
This Policy is maintained by Moodlerooms Inc. on behalf of itself, its parent entity and its US and non-US subsidiaries and divisions (collectively, “Moodlerooms”), and applies to all current clients of Moodlerooms.</p>
<p>III. DEFINITIONS<br>
“Agent” means any third party that processes, collects, or uses Personal Information pursuant to the instructions of, and solely for the benefit of, Moodlerooms, or to which Moodlerooms, Inc. discloses Personal Information for use on its behalf.<br>
“Personal information”, means information that can directly or indirectly lead to the identification of a living person, such as an individual’s name, e-mail, or other identifying characteristic. Personal information does not include information that has been made anonymous, encoded or otherwise stripped of its identifiers, or information that is publicly available, unless combined with other non-public personal information.</p>
<p>IV. SEVEN PRINCIPALS OF SAFE HARBOR<br>
1. NOTICE<br>
The following is our disclosure of how Moodlerooms, Inc. collects and uses personal information; any third parties to which we may disclose that information; how you can access your information and restrict our use of it; and how to contact us with any questions or complaints about how we use your information.<br>
Any personal information sent to us by our clients is used exclusively for the purposes and services for which we contracted. We do not share, transmit, rent or sell that information to any other parties.<br>
We may collect personal information such as name, title, firm, address, e-mail address, and survey results from individuals who have requested information from us or expressed interest in our products and services. You may provide this information to us electronically, over the Internet, or physically. Your personal information will be used by Moodlerooms, Inc., exclusively for the purpose of providing and improving service to you, or informing you of additional products and services which we think will be of interest to you.<br>
Other information gathered through this site is purely statistical, such as what Web pages are visited most often. This information is useful to Moodlerooms, Inc., and enables us not only to improve and upgrade our services but also to refine our product lines and marketing. This information is anonymous in nature.<br>
We do not collect sensitive personal information (e.g., personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, views or activities, social security benefits or information specifying the sex life of the individual or criminal or administrative proceedings) or receive sensitive personal information from any third parties.</p>
<p>2. CHOICE<br>
If you request information from us, you will be given the choice at that time to opt out of receiving future communications from us on information, products, or services that may be of interest to you.<br>
If you have provided us with your personal information in the past, and you do not wish to receive further communications of information, products, or services from us, you can opt out, by sending an email to: unsubscribe@moodlerooms.com.<br>
If you provide personal information to us as part of a service we provide to you or your organization, we do not share, transmit, rent or sell that information to any third parties except as described herein.</p>
<p>3. ONWARD TRANSFER<br>
Moodlerooms only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Moodlerooms in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<p>Where Moodlerooms receives personal information from persons in the EU, Moodlerooms will use and disclose such information only in accordance with the purposes for which it was originally collected or in accordance with notices we might provide to such persons.</p>
<p>We provide personal information to offices, subcontractors or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf or providing the services. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.<br>
We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Moodlerooms, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>Moodlerooms will provide notice and provide individuals with the opportunity to “opt out” if such personal information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for purposes incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected.</p>
<p>4. SECURITY<br>
Moodlerooms employs considerable precautions within the company — including physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards — designed to secure the privacy of all personal information we retain, and protect it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>
<p>Moodlerooms does not require or store any personal information from clients other than email address, name, phone numbers, fax numbers, business address, and contact name.</p>
<p>Moodlerooms Cookies – When you visit Moodlerooms, we send one or more cookies (a small file containing a string of characters) to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>
<p>However, some Moodlerooms features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For more information on Moodlerooms cookies and the EU Privacy Directive, please see section V. of the security policy below.<br>
Log Information – When you use Moodlerooms services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
<p>User Communications – When you send e-mail or other communication to Moodlerooms, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</p>
<p>Other Sites – This Privacy Policy applies to all Web sites and services that are owned and operated by Moodlerooms. We do not exercise control over the site links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Moodlerooms employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<p>5. ACCESS OF RECORDS<br>
Upon an individual’s request, Moodlerooms will offer clients reasonable access to their personal information and will afford clients a reasonable opportunity to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information. If a client would like to access personal information maintained by the Moodlerooms, the client should send an email to: security@moodlerooms.com</p>
<p>For security purposes, the individual may need to provide Moodlerooms with various pieces of personal information to process the request. Moodlerooms may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
<p>6. DATA INTEGRITY</p>
<p>Moodlerooms will take reasonable measures to ensure that personal information is relevant for its intended use, reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.</p>
<p>Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete client personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.</p>
<p>7. ENFORCEMENT<br>
Moodlerooms, Inc., Safe Harbor Compliance Committee, is responsible for verifying that our Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, completely implemented, accessible, and in compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles. The committee is also responsible for employee training related to the Privacy Policy and periodic review to make sure the proper procedures and protections are in place.</p>
<p>Any questions or complaints regarding Moodlerooms, Inc., handling of personal information can be addressed by sending an email to: privacy@moodlerooms.com.</p>
<p>Any complaints or disputes that are not satisfactorily resolved by the Safe Harbor Compliance Committee can be referred to the European Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) for investigation and resolution. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Moodlerooms, you may contact either the panel at ec-dppanel-secr@ec.europa.eu or individual EU DPAs (see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/eu/index_en.htm).</p>
<p>Moodlerooms, reserves the right to update and revise this Privacy Policy at any time consistent with the Safe Harbor Principles. You can determine if this Privacy Policy has been revised since your last visit by referring to the “Effective Date of Current Policy” date at the top of this page. Your use of our Site constitutes your acceptance of the terms of the Privacy Policy as amended or revised by us, and you should therefore review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of its terms.</p>
