This Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Moodlerooms Inc. or offices or subcontractors (collectively, Moodlerooms's "services"). In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post separate privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information, which are accessible from the navigation bar to the left of this notice.<br><br>If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at the address at the top of this page.<br><br><strong>Information we collect and how we use it:</strong><br><br>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Moodlerooms Search.

In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services.<br><br><strong>Choices for personal information</strong><br><br>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.<br><br>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes.

Such information does not identify you individually.<br><br>Please contact us at the address above for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.<br><br><strong>Information security</strong><br><br>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.<br><br>We restrict access to personal information to Moodlerooms employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.

We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.<br><br><strong>Enforcement</strong><br><br>Moodlerooms regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or Moodlerooms's treatment of personal information by contacting us. When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Moodlerooms's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Moodlerooms and an individual.<br><br><strong>Changes to this policy</strong><br><br>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.<br><br>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Policy, please feel free to contact us any time.<br><br><br>*Yes, this document bears a striking resemblance to Google’s policy.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Please download the following PDF as a desktop copy.</p> <a href="http://moodlerooms.com/images/mr_privacy.pdf"> <img src="images/stories/articles.jpg" alt=""> </a> <p>Last changed: June 2007 <br></p>
