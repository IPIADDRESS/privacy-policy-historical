<b>3. Storing Your Personal Data</b>
</p>
<p>
3.1 All information you provide us with is stored on secure servers in the United Kingdom and Bulgaria. We have taken security measures appropriate to the nature of the information stored and the harm that might come from a breach of security.
</p>
<p>
3.2 The information we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a place outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It is possible that it may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA, who work for our company, or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the processing of your bookings, the processing of your payment details and the provision of customer support services.

<p>
3.5 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our websites or our apps; any transmission is at your own risk.

</p>
<p>
<b>5. Your Rights Regarding Your Information</b>
</p>
