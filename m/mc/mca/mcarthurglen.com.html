This Privacy Policy ("Policy") tells you how we collect, use and disclose personally identifiable information that you provide via this website. Please be sure to read this entire Policy before using or submitting information to this Website. McArthurGlen UK Limited respects the privacy of each individual who subscribes to this Website. Your attention is also drawn to the website terms and conditions. This Policy is incorporated into and forms part of the terms and conditions which apply to your use of the website.</p>
<h3>Your Consent</h3>
<p>By visiting to and using this website, you agree and consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this Policy. Personal information is information which identifies you such as (but not limited to) name, email address, contact details etc.</p>
<h3>Active Information Collection</h3>
<p>McArthurGlen UK Limited collects information, including personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you access the website. The kinds of personal information which we may ask you to provide may include your name, the organisation you represent (if any), your contact details, telephone number, email address and professional organisation membership identification. This is not an exhaustive list and we may ask for additional information as relevant from time to time.</p>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<p>McArthurGlen UK Limited may use your personal information (i) to respond to your questions or requests for additional information; (ii) to provide you with information that you have specifically requested or that McArthurGlen UK Limited has asked if you would like to receive; (iii) to provide your contact details to our sales force or third parties to arrange a visit from a medical representative following a request from you and (iv) for internal analysis so that we can better understand how we can improve our products and services. In addition we may use your information to inform you from time to time of other products and/or services we offer which we consider may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive information in this way then you should leave the relevant box in the website blank when we ask for your consent to do this. You may otherwise email us at any time at <strong><a title="marketing@mcarthurglen.com" href="mailto:marketing@mcarthurglen.com" target="_blank">marketing@mcarthurglen.com</a></strong> to indicate that you do not want to receive information in this way from us.</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
<p>McArthurGlen UK Limited may disclose aggregated information that does not include personally identifiable information to third parties (such as its website operator(s), advertising agencies etc.) who assist McArthurGlen UK Limited in improving the presentation of its offerings to the general public. McArthurGlen UK Limited will not disclose your personal information to any third party unless (i) we have informed you about the disclosure when you submitted your information to us and you consented to the disclosure or (ii) the disclosure is required by law or by court order.</p>
<h3>IP Protocol (IP) Addresses</h3>
<p>When you access the Internet using your computer, your Internet service provider assigns you an IP Address. Generally, every time you connect to the Internet, your IP Address changes. In some circumstances (i.e. with some broadband connections) your IP Address may not change in which case it can be associated with your particular computer and may therefore amount to personal information. Examples of the type of information that can be collected using your IP Address include your type of Internet Browser and the type of computer operating system you are using. McArthurGlen UK Limited, or its authorized agents, use your IP Address to collect and report aggregate information on how the website is being used and ways in which the website can be improved.</p>
<h3>Web Log Information</h3>
<p>Web log information is non-personal information that is collected by the computer that hosts the website (the "Website Server") when you visit the website, including, but not limited to, the date and time you visited the website, the type of Internet Browser you are using and the type of computer operating system you are using. Web log information may be collected and used by McArthurGlen UK Limited or its authorized agents in aggregate to assess how the website is being used and how to improve the website.</p>
<h3>Passive Information Collection</h3>
<p>As you navigate through the website, certain information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies and navigational data collection.
