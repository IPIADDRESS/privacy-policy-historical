                    <p>To defend against these threats and the thousands of new threats that emerge each day, McAfee technologies may:&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>·&nbsp;Analyze data sent to/from your device(s) for risks, threats, vulnerabilities, suspicious activity, and attacks;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>·&nbsp;Assess the reputation of the sending/receiving device to determine whether access should be allowed or if the transaction should be continued;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The Information we collect McAfee collects some information that is personal (i.e., information that identifies an individual either alone or in combination with other data). McAfee also collects non- personal information that does
                      not, on its own, identify an individual person. When non-personal information is combined with other information so that it does identify an individual person, we treat that combination as personally identifiable information. McAfee
                      obtains personal information when you or someone acting on your behalf provides it to us. We also collect information when you obtain or use McAfee products or services or when you use a device with McAfee products or services installed.
                      The following are examples of the type of personal information that may be collected directly from you (or someone acting on your behalf):&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>·&nbsp;Contact information (including name, email address, social media ID/handle, mailing address, telephone, and fax number);&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>·&nbsp;Username, password, and other information used to verify identity; and&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>·&nbsp;Photographs, images, biometrics, and related hash values. The following are examples of the type of information that may be collected by McAfee from your web browser or from interactions with our products and services:&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>·&nbsp;Details about your computers, devices, applications, and networks (including IP address, browser characteristics, device ID and characteristics, operating system, system language, and preferences);&nbsp;</p>

                  <div class="faq-response">
                    <p>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer, mobile phone, server) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It is how
                      devices find each other on a network.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>While it is possible that IP addresses can be associated with a single individual’s device, they most often are associated with a group of systems, one system shared by many users, or a gateway into a group of systems or devices.
                      For instance, IP addresses included in an email communication are typically associated with the respective email service provider and not with an individual user’s device.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>McAfee security products and services use IP addresses to protect your information, your devices, and your data. For example, we may detect that a system or a group of systems associated with a particular IP address has been compromised
                      and is sending malware or spam to some of our users. Even without identifying who owns the compromised system or who compromised it, we can assign a score to that IP address to reflect the heightened threat it poses. Our products
                      and services can then divert your traffic away from this IP address or block this IP address from sending malware to your McAfee-protected device before your device is a victim of an attack. The use of IP addresses and other machine
                      data is necessary to keep security protections current, relevant, and effective as cyber threats and attacks evolve over time.</p>

                    <p>McAfee uses “cookies” to remember user preferences and to maximize the performance of our website and services. Additionally, cookies help us to identify returning users so, for example, we don’t need to ask them
