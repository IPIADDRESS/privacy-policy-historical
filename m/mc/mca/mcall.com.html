<b>Privacy Policy</b><br><i>Last Updated: November, 2000</i>
<p>
mcall.com is dedicated to providing visitors to this site with a highly interactive and personalized experience, while at the same time protecting users from any unexpected use of personally identifiable information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number). Like other Web publishers, we collect information from users in order to deliver more individualized content and advertising, and we sometimes permit our advertising and promotional partners to call to your attention products, special offers and unique content we believe might be of interest to you. In each case, we do so only within the guidelines in this policy. Your use of our site tells us you have read and accept the practices outlined in this policy. Please note that information collected prior to the time this policy was posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.
</p><p>
<b>How we gather information from users</b><br>mcall.com gathers information you provide to us when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters, news updates and other products. We also gather information you provide when you participate in interactive areas of our site, including sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities, message boards and chat rooms, etc. Also, in connection with our current and planned electronic commerce services, you may be asked to provide information, including credit card information, necessary to complete a transaction you have requested. Often, the information we request may be identified as "optional." 
</p><p>
mcall.com may also employ "cookies" and other technology to improve your navigation through the site and to allow customization of the site according to your individual preferences. Cookie technology involves a string of information (the cookie) that is passed to your Web browser and stored on your computer. This cookie then identifies you as a unique user and holds your preferences, as you have identified them, and other information from your visit. For example, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit and granting you certain access privileges.
</p><p>
Cookies may also be used to control the number of times you encounter particular advertisements while visiting our sites. For example, while you are on our site, you may see advertisements tailored to things you have shown an interest in. You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we will not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.
</p><p>
Like most Web sites, mcall.com also logs IP addresses (such as the name of your Internet Service Provider of browser), or the electronic location of your computer on the Internet.
</p><p>
<b>What we do with the information we collect</b><br>The information you share with us may be used in several ways. Typically, during your visit to our sites, we will use your registration and demographic information to deliver targeted editorial or advertising content we think might interest you. 
</p><p>
We may also combine information about you, your computer, and your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to create aggregate information about mcall.com users as a whole and to identify their preferences in content and advertising. This aggregated information does not include any personally identifiable information about you. Aggregated information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners or used by Tribune Interactive, Inc., and other Tribune Company affiliates.
</p><p>
We may also use personally identifiable information to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service [underline indicates a link] and privacy policies; services and products offered by Tribune Interactive, Inc., and other Tribune Company affiliates and partners; and other topics we think you might find to be of interest. For example, we may communicate with you from time to time about changes and improvements to mcall.com and about sweepstakes or promotions we are conducting. We also reserve the right to share your information with other Tribune Interactive Web sites and other Tribune Company business units and affiliates. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
</p><p>
From time to time our advertising and promotional partners may use your registration and other information to call to your attention products and offers they believe might interest you. If you prefer not to receive direct communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us any information we might use for this purpose. If you decline at the time you provide us with information, you will not receive e-mail or other communications sent directly by our advertisers utilizing information collected from our site, though we may on occasion send you information on their behalf.
</p><p>
Personal information collected by mcall.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of mcall.com (our Web hosting service and our newsletter provider, for example) may also have access to such information. In all cases, however, we will use your information only as permitted by law. We will also disclose your information in response to a court order and/or when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law. Please note that we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
</p><p>
<b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b><br>mcall.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. mcall.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
</p><p>
For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame that includes mcall.com content, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Through mcall.com, you may also be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Users should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information on a co-branded, affiliated, framed or linked site, or on a site hosted by a third party.
</p><p>
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information you provide. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. The use of cookies and such other technology by third-party servers is common on the Internet. mcall.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information; therefore, the information collected is not subject to mcall.com's privacy policy. 
</p><p>
Finally, you should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, or other messages) on message boards or in chat areas of mcall.com, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of mcall.com.
</p><p>
<b>Children</b><br>mcall.com does not knowingly collect or solicit personally-identifiable information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover that we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe mcall.com has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.
</p><p>
<b>Contacting Us</b><br>We can be reached by contacting:<br>mcall.com<br>c/o Elaine Hall, General Manager<br>101 North Sixth Street<br>Allentown, PA 18105<br>Email: <a href="mailto:elaine.hall@mcall.com">elaine.hall@mcall.com</a>
</p><p>
<b>Changes to this Policy</b><br>mcall.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes, however information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected. 
</p><p>
<b>Governing Law</b><br>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Pennsylvania law. Any claim related to the Site or this policy shall be brought in a federal or state court in Allentown, Pennsylvania, within one year after the claim arises. Users of mcall.com consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such court as the most convenient and appropriate for the resolution of disputes concerning this policy. mcall.com is controlled, operated and administered entirely within the United States. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
