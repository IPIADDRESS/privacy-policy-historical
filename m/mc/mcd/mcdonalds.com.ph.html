        <p>Thank you for visiting us online at www.mcdonalds.com.ph. At  McDonald's, we strive to do everything we can to respect the trust customers  have in our brand and our commitment to your privacy is no exception. We are committed  to protecting and safeguarding consumer privacy on the Internet, especially for  children.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thanks again for visiting our web-site and for placing your  trust in McDonald's.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>McDonald's Internet Privacy Policy</strong></p>
        <p>Golden Arches Development Corporation  ("McDonald's") is pleased to provide information to all of its  customers about its online privacy policy. Please be assured that McDonald's  uses its best efforts to protect the privacy of visitors to this web site. Be  first.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Information We Collect and How It Is Used</strong></p>
        <p>McDonald's only gathers personal information, such as, first  and last names, addresses and email addresses, when voluntarily submitted by  you. For example, personal information may be collected from you in order to  get your feedback on our web sites and our products or to enter you in one of  our contests or sweepstakes.</p>
        <p>In addition, McDonald's may gather complete and accurate  customer location and contact number/s only for food delivery services it  provides.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong></p>
        <p>McDonald's may share personal information within the  McDonald's Family. The McDonald's Family includes the McDonald's Corporation,  our franchisees, our subsidiaries and our affiliates. Of course, any use of  this information by the McDonald's Family will comply with this policy.  Occasionally, with your permission, we will send marketing information to you,  such as discount coupons, information about new product offerings, etc. If you  do not elect to receive such materials, we will not send them to you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Companies and other third – party providers of McDonald’s  may be engaged by McDonald's to perform a variety of functions, such as,  fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions, providing technical services for  our web sites, etc. These companies may have access to personal information if  needed to perform such functions.</p>
        <p>McDonald's does not sell, transfer or disclose personal  information to third parties outside the McDonald's Family or such other  entities as may be described above. However, with your permission, we will, on  occasion send marketing information on behalf of one of our business partners  about products or services they provide that may be of interest to you. You may  be asked if you wish to receive marketing materials from McDonald's business  partners. If you elect to receive such materials, McDonald's will not share  your personal information with such partners but rather will send a mailing or  email on behalf of the partners.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>McDonald's reserves the right to use or disclose any information  as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the  integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law  enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Our Privacy Policy Regarding Children</strong></p>
        <p>McDonald's is very sensitive to privacy issues. We are proud  of our longtime commitment to our customers. We are especially careful in any  communications with one of our most treasured customers - children.</p>
        <p>On our web sites, we offer many features, like games and  coloring books, which do not require a child to provide any personal  information. We collect only limited personal information from children 12 and  under (like their email addresses) to respond to their online requests. For  example, we may collect a child's email address in order to send the child a  screen saver, but we promptly delete the email address from our system. Or, we  may collect a child's email address in order to enter the child in a lucky draw  or sweepstakes. We may also ask a child to provide an email address of a parent  so we can notify the parent or seek consent. We will not collect more detailed  information from a child 12 and younger, such as a postal address or a  telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian. McDonald's will  not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child's  disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to  participate in that activity.</p>
        <p>Personal information collected from children is used solely  by McDonald's or other entities that provide technical, fulfillment or other  services to McDonald's. For example, such entities may provide services, such  as, improving our web sites, fulfilling requests or administering lucky draws  or sweepstakes. This personal information is not sold or transferred to third  parties.</p>
        <p>We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their  children's on-line activities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Access</strong></p>
        <p>You are in control of any personal information you provide  to us on-line. If at any time, you would like to correct the personal  information we have about you or if you would like to change your preferences  for contacts from us or on behalf of our business partners, you can let us know  by contacting us at the email or postal address listed below.</p>
        <p>In order to review any personal information we have about  you or to ask us to delete that information or to stop further use of the  information, please submit this information request form. In order to review  any personal information we have about your child or to ask us to delete that  information or to stop further use of the information, please submit this  information request form.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
        <p>We may offer links to sites that are not operated by  McDonald's Corporation. If you visit one of these linked sites, you should  review their privacy and other policies. We are not responsible for the  policies and practices of other companies, and any information you submit to  those companies is subject to their privacy policies.</p>

        <p>Other McDonald's Web Sites</p>
        <p>All McDonald's web sites operated by McDonald's Corporation  will adhere to this privacy policy. The policies of some McDonald's sites may  vary, however, because of local customs, practices or laws or due to  circumstances unique to that site. In all cases, however, sites operated by  McDonald's Corporation will honor the commitments to our customers set forth in  this policy regarding the collection and use of personal information.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Franchisee Web Sites</strong></p>
        <p>Many McDonald's restaurants are owned and operated by  franchisees, who are independent businessmen and women. Some franchisees also  operate web sites. In many cases, franchisee sites follow this privacy policy.  However, please review the privacy policy of each site to determine the privacy  policies of that site.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Changes to our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
        <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 1st April, 2006. From  time to time, it may be necessary for McDonald's to change this privacy policy.  If we change our policy, we will post the revised version here, so we suggest  that you check here periodically for the most up-to-date version of our privacy  policy. Rest assured, however, that any changes will not be retroactively  applied and will not alter how we handle previously collected information.</p>
        <p>Your consent effectively constitutes a waiver of any and all  privacy rights pertaining to the disclosure, collection and use of the personal  information and data under the specific terms and conditions of McDonald’s  Internet Privacy Policy.</p>
