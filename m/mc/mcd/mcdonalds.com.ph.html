      If parent or guardian consent is required we will collect the email address of the parent or guardian so we
      can provide notice of our information practices and/or seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent.
      McDonald’s Philippines will not condition a Child's participation in any child-appropriate online activity

    <p>
    <span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
      “<strong class="custom-strong">Cookies</strong>“ are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record
      keeping purposes. Cookies allow the website to remember important information that will make your use
      of the site more convenient. “<strong class="custom-strong">Web beacon</strong>“ is a small object or image that is embedded into a web page,
      application, or email and is used to track activity. They are also sometimes referred to as pixels and tags.
      Like most websites, McDonald’s Philippines uses cookies or web beacons and other similar technologies
      for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience.
    </span></span>

      or your preferred items or store locations, or to administer certain contests and promotions and to help
      customize your experience. We may associate Personal Data with a cookie file in those instances. Your
      browser and other choices may impact your experiences with the online Services.
