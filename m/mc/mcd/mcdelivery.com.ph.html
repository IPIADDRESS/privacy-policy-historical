    <h3>
      <strong class="custom-strong">Information from Automated Means</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>
      When you visit, use or interact with our Sites or Mobile Apps, we may collect certain information by
      automated or passive means using a variety of technologies which may be downloaded to your device
      and may set or modify settings on your device. The “Usage Information“ we collect may include your
      Internet Protocol (“IP“) address, computer/mobile device operating system and browser type, type of
      mobile device, the characteristics of the mobile device, the unique device identifier (“UDID“) or mobile
      equipment identifier (“MEID“) for your mobile device, the address of a referring web site (if any), and the
      pages you visit on our Sites and Mobile Apps, and the times of visit. We may use this information for any
      and all lawful purposes, including to operate, maintain, and manage our Services and to provide other
      services such as technical support. We provide additional information regarding our use of “cookies“ in
      this Privacy Policy below.
    </p>

    <p>
      McDonald’s Philippines may use various new and hereafter developed technologies to collect Usage
      Information and demographic information about you (“Tracking Technologies“) which technologies may
      be downloaded to your device and may set or modify settings on your device. A few of the methods that
      may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent
      technology and methods hereafter developed):
    </p>

    <ul style="font-family: 'akzidenz-grotesk_cnd' !important;">
      <li>
        <i>Embedded Scripts.</i> An embedded script is a programming code that is designed to collect
        information about your interactions with Mobile Apps, such as the links you click on. The code is
        temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider,
        is active only while you are connected to the Mobile App, and is deactivated or deleted
        thereafter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>ETag (or entity tag).</i> A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a
        web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL
        ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner, ETags are a form of
        device identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer
        blocks HTTP, Flash, and HTML5 cookies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Mobile Apps may collect precise information about the location of your mobile device using technologies
      such as GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity. McDonald’s Philippines uses this information for locationbased
      services that you request such as locating nearby McDonald’s restaurants or identifying special
      offers that may be of interest to you or to deliver relevant content to you based on your location or to
      allow you to share your location to other users as part of the Services under our Mobile Apps. For most
      mobile devices, you are able to withdraw your permission for McDonald’s Philippines to acquire this
      information on your location through the device settings. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have any questions about how to prevent us from collecting exact information about your
      location, we recommend you contact your mobile-device service provider, the device manufacturer, or
      your web-browser provider. Some online Services may not work properly without information about

      <strong>3. Children’s Privacy Notice</strong>
    </h2>

    <p>
      We are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit our Sites and Mobile Apps or
      use our Services. This Children’s Privacy Notice is designed to answer your questions regarding our
      practices with respect to Personal Data we collect through our Services from children under the age of
      eighteen (18) (subject always to applicable law).
    </p>

    <h3>
      <strong class="custom-strong">What Personal Information Does McDonald’s Collect?</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>
      Generally, Personal Data will not be collected from any person who is known by McDonald’s Philippines
      to be under the age of 18 (the “<strong class="custom-strong">Child</strong>“) without the consent of a parent or legal guardian.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the event that the Child is allowed to access information through the online Services, rest assured that
      we collect only limited Personal Data from the Child e.g. email addresses, postal address, contact number
      upon the consent provided by a parent or guardian in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We may offer many features on our Sites, like games and colouring books, which do not require a Child
      to provide any Personal Data. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We will not collect more detailed information from a Child, without the consent of a parent or guardian.
      If parent or guardian consent is required we will collect the email address of the parent or guardian so we
      can provide notice of our information practices and/or seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent.
      McDonald’s Philippines will not condition a Child's participation in any child-appropriate online activity
      on the Child's disclosure of more Personal Data than is reasonably necessary to participate in that
      activity.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <strong class="custom-strong">How Does McDonald’s Use the Personal Data It Collects?</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>
      We use email addresses submitted by a Child in order to respond to the Child’s request or to notify the
      Child if he or she has won or lost a contest or promotion they entered or participated in. We use the email 
      address of a parent or guardian, in order to provide the parent notice of our information practices or to
      seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Personal Data collected from the Child is used solely by McDonald’s Philippines, the McDonald's Family,
      and its service providers.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <strong class="custom-strong">How Does McDonald’s Share Personal Information?</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>
      We may share the Child's Personal Data with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to protect
      the security or integrity of our Services, take precautions against liability, or respond to judicial process or
      requests from other governmental authorities; or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate
      to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual
      illegal activity.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may also share Personal Data collected from the Child with vendors that perform services for
      McDonald's Philippines and the McDonald’s Family. These services may include hosting our online
      Services, providing technical, marketing, advertising fulfilment or other services to GADC or the
      McDonald's system. Such vendors are obligated to protect the confidentiality of the Personal Data that we
      share with them.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <strong class="custom-strong">Requests from Parents / Guardians Regarding Our Children’s Privacy Practices</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>
      Parents / Guardians may review the Personal Data we have collected from their Child that has not been
      deleted, and can request that the Personal Data be deleted from our records if it has not been already.
      Parents / Guardians also may refuse to permit further collection or use of their Child’s Personal Data,
      when the parent / guardian has previously provided consent. To do so, please contact us through the
      Contact information provided below.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <strong class="custom-strong">Who Should I Contact with Questions?</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>
      We urge parents / guardians to regularly monitor and supervise their Child’s on-line activities. If you
      have any questions about our Children’s Privacy Notice, please contact us through the Contact
      information provided below.
