      <p align="justify"><strong>McDonald's Internet Privacy Policy</strong><br>

      </p>
      <p align="justify">Golden Arches Development Corporation ("McDonald's") is pleased to provide information to all of its customers about its online privacy policy. Please be assured that McDonald's uses its best efforts to protect the privacy of visitors to this web site. Be first.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Types of Information We Collect and How It Is Used</strong><br>
        <br>
      </p>
     <p align="justify">McDonald's only gathers personal information, such as, first and last names, addresses and email addresses, when voluntarily submitted by you. For example, personal information may be collected from you in order to get your feedback on our web sites and our products or to enter you in one of our contests or sweepstakes.i<br><br></p>
     <p align="justify">In addition, McDonald's may gather complete and accurate customer location and contact number/s only for food delivery services it provides.
<br><br></p>
     <p align="justify">By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of the information by McDonald's.
<br><br></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="justify">McDonald's may share personal information within the McDonald's Family. The McDonald's Family includes McDonald's Corporation, our franchisees, our subsidiaries and our affiliates. Of course, any use of this information by the McDonald's Family will comply with this policy. Occasionally, with your permission, we will send marketing information to you, such as discount coupons, information about new product offerings, etc. If you do not elect to receive such materials, we will not send them to you.<br><br></p>
     <p align="justify">
Companies may be engaged by McDonald's to perform a variety of functions, such as, fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions, providing technical services for our web sites, etc. These companies may have access to personal information if needed to perform such functions.<br><br></p>
     <p align="justify">
McDonald's does not sell, transfer or disclose personal information to third parties outside the McDonald's Family or as may be described above. However, with your permission, we will, on occasion send marketing information on behalf of one of our business partners about products or services they provide that may be of interest to you. You may be asked if you wish to receive marketing materials from McDonald's business partners. If you elect to receive such materials, McDonald's will not share your personal information with such partners but rather will send a mailing or email on behalf of the partners.
<br><br></p>
     <p align="justify">
McDonald's reserves the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety.

      <p align="justify"><strong>Our Privacy Policy Regarding Children</strong><br>
        <br>
      </p>
     <p align="justify">
McDonald's is very sensitive to privacy issues. We are proud of our longtime commitment to our customers. We are especially careful in any communications with one of our most treasured customers - children.<br><br></p>
     <p align="justify">
On our web sites, we offer many features, like games and coloring books, which do not require a child to provide any personal information. We collect only limited personal information from children 12 and under (like their email addresses) to respond to their online requests. For example, we may collect a child's email address in order to send the child a screen saver, but we promptly delete the email address from our system. Or, we may collect a child's email address in order to enter the child in a lucky draw or sweepstakes. We may also ask a child to provide an email address of a parent so we can notify the parent or seek consent. We will not collect more detailed information from a child 12 and younger, such as a postal address or a telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian. McDonald's will not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.<br><br></p>
     <p align="justify">
Personal information collected from children is used solely by McDonald's or other entities that provide technical, fulfillment or other services to McDonald's. For example, such entities may provide services, such as, improving our web sites, fulfilling requests or administering lucky draws or sweepstakes. This personal information is not sold or transferred to third parties.<br><br></p>
     <p align="justify">
We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children's on-line activities.<br><br></p>
