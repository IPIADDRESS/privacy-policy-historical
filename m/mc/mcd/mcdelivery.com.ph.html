    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="yhighlight">TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED</p>
    <p class="yhighlight">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>McDonald's only gathers personal information, such as, first  and last names, addresses and email addresses, when voluntarily submitted by  you. For example, personal information may be collected from you in ord er to  get your feedback on our web sites and our products or to enter you in one of  our contests or sweepstakes.i</p>
    <p>In addition, McDonald's may gather complete and accurate  customer location and contact number/s only for food delivery services it  provides.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="yhighlight">SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
    <p class="yhighlight">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>McDonald's may share personal information within the  McDonald's Family. The McDonald's Family includes the McDonald's Corporation,  our franchisees, our subsidiaries and our affiliates. Of course, any us e of  this information by the McDonald's Family will comply with this policy.  Occasionally, with your permission, we will send marketing information to you,  such as discount coupons, information about new product offerings, etc. If you  do not elect to receive such materials, we will not send them to you.</p>
    <p>Companies and other third – party providers of McDonald’s  may be engaged by McDonald's to perform a variety of functions, such as,  fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions, providing technical services for  our web sites, etc. These companies may have access to personal information if  needed to perform such functions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>McDonald's does not sell, transfer or disclose personal  information to third parties outside the McDonald's Family or such other  entities as may be described above. However, with your permission, we will, on  occasion send marketing information on behalf of one of our business partners  about products or services they provide that may be of interest to you. You may  be asked if you wish to receive marketing materials from McDonald's business  partners.

    <p class="yhighlight">OUR PRIVACY POLICY REGARDING CHILDREN</p>
    <p class="yhighlight">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>McDonald's is very sensitive to privacy issues. We are proud  of our longtime commitment to our customers. We are especially careful in any  communications with one of our most treasured customers - children.</p>
    <p>On our web sites, we offer many features, like games and  coloring books, which do not require a child to provide any personal  information. We collect only limited personal information from children 12 and  under (like their email addresses) to respond to their online requests. For  example, we may collect a child's email address in order to send the child a  screen saver, but we promptly delete the email address from our system. Or, we  may collect a child's email address in order to enter the child in a lucky draw  or sweepstakes. We may also ask a child to provide an email address of a parent  so we can notify the parent or seek consent. We will not collect more detailed  information from a child 12 and younger, such as a postal address or a  telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian. McDonald's will  not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child's  disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to  participate in that activity.</p>
    <p>Personal information collected from children is used solely  by McDonald's or other entities that provide technical, fulfillment or other  services to McDonald's. For example, such entities may provide services, such  as, improving our web sites, fulfilling requests or administering lucky draws  or sweepstakes. This personal information is not sold or transferred to third  parties.</p>
    <p>We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their  children's on-line activities.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="yhighlight">ACCESS</p>

    <p>You are in control of any personal information you provide  to us on-line.
