                  <p>Thank you for visiting us online at McDonalds.com. At McDonald's, 
                    we strive to do everything we can to respect the trust customers

                    Policy</p>
                  <p>McDonald's Corporation ("McDonald's") is pleased to provide 
                    information to all of its customers about its online privacy 
                    policy. Please be assured that McDonald's uses its best efforts 
                    to protect the privacy of visitors to this web site. 
                  </p><p><b>Types of Information We Collect and How It Is Used</b> 
                  </p><p>McDonald's only gathers personal information, such as, first 
                    and last names, addresses and email addresses, when voluntarily 
                    submitted by you. For example, personal information may be 
                    collected from you in order to get your feedback on our web 
                    sites and our products or to enter you in one of our contests 
                    or sweepstakes. 
                  </p><p><b>Sharing of Personal Information</b> 
                  </p><p>McDonald's may share personal information within the McDonald's 
                    Family. The McDonald's Family includes McDonald's Corporation, 
                    our franchisees, our subsidiaries and our affiliates. Of course, 
                    any use of this information by the McDonald's Family will 
                    comply with this policy. Occasionally, with your permission, 
                    we will send marketing information to you, such as discount 
                    coupons, information about new product offerings, etc. If 
                    you do not elect to receive such materials, we will not send 
                    them to you. 
                  </p><p>Companies may be engaged by McDonald's to perform a variety 
                    of functions, such as, fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions, 
                    providing technical services for our web sites, etc. These 
                    companies may have access to personal information if needed 
                    to perform such functions. However, these companies may only 
                    use such personal information for the purpose of performing 
                    that function and may not use it for any other purpose. 
                  </p><p>McDonald's does not sell, transfer or disclose personal information 
                    to third parties outside the McDonald's Family. However, with 
                    your permission, we will, on occasion send marketing information 
                    on behalf of one of our business partners about products or 
                    services they provide that may be of interest to you. You 
                    may be asked if you wish to receive marketing materials from 
                    McDonald's business partners. If you elect to receive such 
                    materials, McDonald's will not share your personal information 
                    with such partners but rather will send a mailing or email 
                    on behalf of the partners. 
                  </p><p>McDonald's reserves the right to use or disclose any information 
                    as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, 
                    to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, 
                    or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an 
                    investigation on a matter of public safety. 
                  </p><p><b>Our Privacy Policy Regarding Children</b> 
                  </p><p>McDonald's is very sensitive to privacy issues. We are proud 
                    of our longtime commitment to our customers. We are especially 
                    careful in any communications with one of our most treasured 
                    customers - children. 
                  </p><p>On our web sites, we offer many features, like games and 
                    coloring books, which do not require a child to provide any 
                    personal information. We collect only limited personal information 
                    from children 12 and under (like their email addresses) to 
                    respond to their online requests. For example, we may collect 
                    a child's email address in order to send the child a screen 
                    saver, but we promptly delete the email address from our system. 
                    Or, we may collect a child's email address in order to enter 
                    the child in a sweepstakes. We may also ask a child to provide 
                    an email address of a parent so we can notify the parent or 
                    seek consent. We will not collect more detailed information 
                    from a child 12 and younger, such as a postal address or a 
                    telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian. 
                    McDonald's will not condition a child's participation in any 
                    online activity on the child's disclosure of more personal 
                    information than is reasonably necessary to participate in 
                    that activity. 
                  </p><p>Personal information collected from children is used solely 
                    by McDonald's or other entities that provide technical, fulfillment 
                    or other services to McDonald's. For example, such entities 
                    may provide services, such as, improving our web sites, fulfilling 
                    requests or administering sweepstakes. This personal information 
                    is not sold or transferred to third parties. 
                  </p><p>We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their 
                    children's on-line activities. 
                  </p><p><b>Access</b> 
                  </p><p>You are in control of any personal information you provide 
                    to us on-line. If at any time, you would like to correct the 
                    personal information we have about you or if you would like 
                    to change your preferences for contacts from us or on behalf 
                    of our business partners, you can let us know by contacting 
                    us at the email or postal address listed below. 
                  </p><p>In order to review any personal information we have <b><i>about 
                    you</i></b> or to ask us to delete that information or to 
                    stop further use of the information, please submit this <a href="form/index.html" target="_top"><b>information

                  </p><p><b>Cookies</b> 
                  </p><p>"Cookies" are pieces of information that a web site transfers 
                    to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. 
                    Cookies allow the web site to remember important information 
                    that will make your use of the site more convenient. Like

                    in order to improve your on-line experience. For example, 
                    we track the total number of visitors to our site on an anonymous 
                    aggregate basis. We may also employ cookies so that we remember 
                    you when you return to the site, to keep track of the items 
                    in your shopping cart if you purchase merchandise online, 
                    to administer certain contests and sweepstakes and to help 
                    customize your McDonald's web experience. We may associate 
                    personal information with a cookie file in those instances.

                    of all the features of this web site. 
                  </p><p><b>Links to Other Sites</b> 
                  </p><p>We may offer links to sites that are not operated by McDonald's 
                    Corporation. If you visit one of these linked sites, you should 
                    review their privacy and other policies. We are not responsible 
                    for the policies and practices of other companies. 
                  </p><p><b>Other McDonald's Web Sites</b> 
                  </p><p>All McDonald's web sites operated by McDonald's Corporation 
                    will adhere to this privacy policy. The policies of some McDonald's 
                    sites may vary, however, because of local customs, practices 
                    or laws or due to circumstances unique to that site. In all 
                    cases, however, sites operated by McDonald's Corporation will 
                    honor the commitments to our customers set forth in this policy 
                    regarding the collection and use of personal information. 
                  </p><p><b>Franchisee Web Sites</b> 
                  </p><p>Many McDonald's restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees, 
                    who are independent businessmen and women. Some franchisees 
                    also operate web sites. In many cases, franchisee sites follow 
                    this privacy policy. However, please review the privacy policy 
                    of each site to determine the privacy policies of that site. 
                  </p><p><b>Changes to our Privacy Policy</b> 
                  </p><p>From time to time, it may be necessary for McDonald's to 
                    change this privacy policy, so we suggest that you check here 
                    periodically. Rest assured, however, that any changes will 
                    not be retroactively applied and will not alter how we handle
