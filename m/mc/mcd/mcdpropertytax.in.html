		<p style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Personal

		<p style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Some of our Web 
		pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a 
		small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information 
		about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve 
		to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most

		<p style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Tracking 
		technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host 
		names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating 
		system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is

		to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze 
		information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and 
		statistics. </span></p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">To protect your

		<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Notice</span></h5>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Where M.C.D
		collects Personal Information on the web, we intend to post a purpose 
		statement that explains why Personal Information will be collected and 
		whether we plan to share such Personal Information outside of M.C.D
		or those working on M.C.D's behalf. M.C.D does not intend to transfer 
		Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are 
		not bound to act on M.C.D's behalf unless such transfer is legally required. </span>

		<h5 style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Choice</span></h5>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">You may choose 
		whether or not to provide Personal Information to M.C.D. The notice we 
		intend to provide where 'M.C.D' 
		collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this 
		choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we 
		request, you can still visit most of M.C.D's Web sites, but you may 
		be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve
		our interaction with you. </span></p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">If you chose to

		<p class="MsoBodyText">We recognize industry standards and employ 
		security safeguards to protect personally identifiable information from 
		unauthorized access and misuse. You should understand that the open 
		nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without 
		security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than 
		those for whom the data is intended. We do not disclose the personally 
		identifiable information that you provide us to third parties, except as 
		necessary to provide the product or service you have specifically

		help us deliver programs, products, information, and services. Service 
		providers are also an important means by which 'M.C.D' maintains its Web 
		site and mailing lists. 'M.C.D' will take reasonable steps to ensure 
		that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect 
		Personal Information on M.C.D's behalf. </span></p>

		intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third

		Personal Information collected online without consent. </span></p>
