</p>

<p>If you require any more information or have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us by email at admin@mccapes.com</p>

<p>The privacy of our visitors to mccapes.com is important to us.<br><br>

At mccapes.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of information we receive and collect when you use and visit mccapes.com, and how we safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

<p><strong>Information collected</strong><br><br>

We collect information from you when you register on our website and your custom Minecraft settings when/if you wish to provide them.<br><br>

When registering on our site, as appropriate, you will be asked to enter your Minecraft username and choose a password. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.<br><br>

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways: <br>
- To show your customisations inside the Minecraft game<br>
- To improve our website (we continually strive to improve our website based on the information and feedback we receive from you)</p>

<p><strong>Log files</strong><br><br>

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Verizon Communications), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer, Firefox or Chrome), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong><br><br>

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information<br><br>

We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, login to some of our website's features, keep track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.<br><br>

We also use third party advertisements on mccapes.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).<br><br>

Other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) may also be used by the third-party ad networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see.<br><br>

mccapes.com has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers.<br><br>

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices as well as for instructions about how to opt-out of certain practices. mccapes.com's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.<br><br>

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.<br><br>

Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</p>

<p><strong>DoubleClick DART Cookie</strong><br><br>

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on mccapes.com.<br><br>

Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on their visit to mccapes.com and other sites on the Internet and serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based targeting"). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (for example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses "non personally identifiable information". It does <strong>NOT</strong> track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.<br><br>

Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy at the following URL: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Usage tracking</strong><br><br>

Like millions of other websites on the Internet, mccapes.com uses Google Analytics to gather usage data.<br><br>

Google Analytics records:<br>
- What website you came from to get here<br>
- How long you stay for<br>
- What kind of computer you're using<br>
- Other similar, generalised information<br><br>

We also track the search terms that a user enters in our "Search" function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users.

The tracking information allows us to better understand the kind of people who come to mccapes.com and what content they're viewing. This allows us to make better decisions about the future of the website and its related content.<br><br>

All of our activity falls within the bounds of the Google Analytics Terms of Service.<br><br>

You can opt out of Google's advertising tracking cookie at the following URL: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Disclosure of information to outside parties</strong><br><br>

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

<p><strong>Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</strong><br><br>
