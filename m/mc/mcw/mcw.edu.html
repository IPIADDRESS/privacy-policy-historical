                <p>The following EEA privacy disclosures (the “Disclosures”) provide information about the collection, use, processing and sharing of data about individuals located in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway (the “European Economic Area” or “EEA”).  In these Disclosures, </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>“GDPR” </strong>means the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation;</li>
    <li><strong>“Personal Data”</strong> means information that relates to an individual who is directly or indirectly identified or identifiable; and </li>
    <li><strong>“EEA Processing Activities”</strong> means the collection, use, processing or sharing of Personal Data when those activities are within the scope of the GDPR.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These Disclosures apply only to the use of Personal Data in EEA Processing Activities.  Further, these Disclosures apply only to the Medical College of Wisconsin, Inc. and its Schools, Centers, Departments and other MCW units and controlled entities (collectively, “MCW Entities”) that link to these Disclosures or expressly adopt them in writing.</strong>  In these Disclosures the words “we” or “our” refer to each such MCW Entity.  In some cases a MCW Entity may provide other information about its EEA Processing Activities in its own supplemental or separate disclosures. </p>
<p>These Disclosures apply to EEA Processing Activities by any means, including hardcopy (such as paper applications or forms) and electronic means (such as websites and mobile applications). </p>
<p><strong>A.	How We Collect and Use Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We collect several categories of Personal Data in circumstances that may involve EEA Processing Activities, including data you provide, data collected automatically (potentially including location data), and data we obtain from third party sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We use the Personal Data that we collect to carry on various institutional, administrative, educational or research activities.  As described in more detail below, we rely on a number of legal bases to lawfully process your Personal Data.</p>
<p>The ways in which we collect and use your Personal Data vary depending on the relationship between you and us, as well as the MCW Entity with which you interact.  The following sections of these Disclosures describe in more detail how we collect and use Personal Data in various circumstances that may involve EEA Processing Activities.  Please note that, depending on the situation, some of the processing of Personal Data we do in the various circumstances described below may not fall within the scope of the GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>1.    Personal Data We Obtain from You </strong></p>
<p><strong>Websites and Mobile Applications</strong></p>
<p>As is true of most digital platforms, we gather certain data automatically when you use one of our websites or mobile applications, such as your IP address, browser type and device type.  Certain web-forms also collect Personal Data you provide, for example when you enter the data into form fields on a feedback page.  If we also process data through our websites or mobile applications for one of the activities described further below, those sections will provide additional information about how data are collected and used.  We and our third-party vendors collect Personal Data for the primary purposes of conducting analytics, responding to your requests and providing you with relevant information. <br>
<br>
<strong>Admissions and Financial Aid</strong></p>
<p>We collect and use various kinds of Personal Data when you apply for admission to a School, program or course offered by us, and when you seek financial aid, if available.  The primary source of these data is your application.  We may solicit additional data, for example, from interviewers as part of the admissions process, if applicable, or from other available sources when identifying potential candidates for admission in connection with recruiting activities.  The Personal Data collected by us, or on our behalf, during the admissions process is collected for the primary purposes of considering your candidacy for admission to the relevant School, program or course, evaluating your eligibility for financial aid, if applicable, and, if you are admitted and enroll, facilitating your education (such as by sharing Personal Data with registrars and others in order to enable your enrollment and participation in the School, program or course to which you have been admitted). <br>
<br>
<strong>Alumni and Donors</strong></p>
<p>We collect and use various kinds of Personal Data about alumni, donors and prospective donors from a number of sources, including data you provide to us, for example, when you update your alumni or donor profile, connect with us on social media, complete a donation form or register to attend MCW events.  If you were a student or studied at MCW, some of your Personal Data are transferred from your student record into our alumni databases.  We may also collect Personal Data from publicly available sources or third-party sources that support our operations.  The Personal Data collected by us, or on our behalf, is collected for the primary purpose of providing you opportunities to engage with MCW, alumni, donors, prospective donors and students through interactions, events and your gifts or donations.  We may disclose your data to other MCW affiliated entities and individuals such as alumni clubs and special interest groups (SIGS) or volunteers when their work meets one of the purposes described below.  <br>
<br>
<strong>Online Education</strong></p>
<p>We and our third-party vendors collect your Personal Data when you apply or register for online education offerings.  Further Personal Data collection occurs upon enrollment for courses or programs and throughout your online education interactions.  In some cases, our collection of Personal Data from you in connection with online education activities takes place as part of a “hybrid” program in which you also may participate in person. <br>
The Personal Data collected by us, or on our behalf, are collected for the primary purpose of providing online education courses and programs, and, if applicable, evaluating qualification for online education certificates or credit.  <br>
<br>
<strong>Employees and Job Applicants</strong></p>
<p>We collect your Personal Data when you apply to work for us.  Further Personal Data collection occurs at hiring and throughout your employment relationship with us.</p>
<p>The Personal Data collected by us, or on our behalf, are collected for the primary purpose of providing employment or enabling authorized persons to utilize our services and facilities. <br>
<br>
<strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>Our researchers and affiliates may collect, use and share your Personal Data as part of a research study in which you have agreed to participate as a research subject or researcher, or in which your existing data are used.  Most often, before any Personal Data are collected for research purposes, you will be provided a consent and/or authorization form relating to the specific research project that explains the types of data collected and the purposes for which such data are processed and shared.  In such a case, the description of the collection and use of your Personal Data provided in the consent and/or authorization form will replace the information provided here.  The Personal Data collected by our researchers and affiliates, or on their behalf, is collected for the primary purpose of furthering research and understanding in fields of academic study.</p>
<p>In certain research studies, we may ask to collect on-line information from you to help us determine your eligibility for the study.  Additional information on how we collect and use this information may be found at “<a href="/-/media/MCW/About-MCW/Information-for-Potential-Research-Volunteers---2018-02-05.pdf?la=en" target="_blank">Information for Potential Research Volunteers Who Complete Medical College of Wisconsin (“MCW”) On-Line Web Forms</a> (PDF).”</p>
<p>Additional examples of Personal Data that may be collected for research purposes are listed below.  Not every research study will collect each of these types of data.  If you have questions about the processing of your data in connection with a research study, you should contact the MCW personnel who are conducting the research or the contact persons named in any consent form you signed when you joined the study. </p>
<p><strong>2.    Personal Data We Obtain from Third Party Sources </strong></p>
<p>As part of our EEA Processing Activities, we may obtain certain Personal Data about you from third party sources, which we may use for the purposes and in the ways described in “How We Collect and Use Personal Data” above and in “Additional Uses of Personal Data” below.  In some cases, we may obtain your consent for additional uses. <br>
<br>
<strong>Partners and Service Providers </strong></p>
<p>We use partners and service providers, such as application facilitators including the Common Application, the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) ® and the Pharmacy College Application Service (PharmCAS).  We also use payment processors (for example, CyberSource) and analytics providers (for example, Qualtrics), to perform services on our behalf.  Some of these partners have access to Personal Data about you that we may not otherwise have (for example, when you sign up directly with that provider) and may share some or all of these data with us. <br>
<br>
<strong>Single Sign-On </strong></p>
<p>Some of our online services or research activities may allow you to register and login to those services through a third-party platform.  When you login to our service through a third-party platform, you allow us to access and collect any Personal Data from your third-party platform account permitted under the settings and privacy statement of that platform. <br>
<br>
<strong>Supplemental Personal Data </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We may receive additional Personal Data from third-party sources, such as public or private databases (for example, compilations of email or postal addresses), or companies or institutions that may sponsor or facilitate your participation in one of our programs, which we may also append to existing Personal Data.   <br>
<br>

<p>You also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Data as part of the EEA Processing Activities, where our processing is solely based on your consent, subject to certain limitations at law.  In some cases, you can do this by discontinuing use of the services involved in the EEA Processing Activities.  This would include by closing all of your online accounts with us and contacting us at <a href="mailto:compliance@mcw.edu?subject=website%20inquiry">compliance@mcw.edu</a> to request that your Personal Data be deleted.  If you withdraw your consent to the use or sharing of your Personal Data for the purposes set out in these Disclosures or the other MCW privacy statements that link to or expressly adopt these Disclosures, you may not have access to all (or any) of the related services, and we might not be able to provide you all (or any) of the services.

For example, we may retain certain data if we need to do so to comply with an independent legal obligation, if we still need the data for the lawful purposes for which we obtained the data, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue our legitimate interest in keeping our services and operations safe and secure. </p>
<p>If you have any complaints regarding our privacy practices, you have the right to make a complaint with your national data protection authority (i.e., supervisory authority). </p>
