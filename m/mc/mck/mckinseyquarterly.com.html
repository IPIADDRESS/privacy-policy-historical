<a name="collected"><b>What personally-identifiable information is collected?</b></a><br>
McKinsey collects personally-identifiable information on certain areas of the Site when users register, request publications or other information, sign up for conferences and events, apply for jobs, and participate in user posting areas, such as bulletin boards, discussion forums, and surveys. The personally-identifiable information collected may consist of a unique access ID, company or school affiliations, titles, and contact information, such as names, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone and fax numbers, and, for recruiting purposes, any other personally-identifiable information on your resume. You may have the opportunity to purchase publications on the Site, in which case we may collect order information and your credit card information in order to facilitate shipment and payment.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<p>
<a name="used"><b>How may my personally-identifiable information be used?</b></a><br>
McKinsey uses your personally-identifiable information to fulfill your requests for publications or other information, to process your requests to participate in conferences and events, and to evaluate any job applications or other employment-related inquiries that you may submit. We may keep any of your personally-identifiable information on file and use it to contact you for recruiting purposes. McKinsey also uses personally-identifiable information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in specific areas and articles posted on our Site. The e-mail addresses provided at registration allow McKinsey to send e-mail to individuals based on the areas of interest that they indicate during the registration process. If you do not wish to receive e-mailed advance notice of articles, simply do not check off any of the subject boxes on the registration page. McKinsey uses personally-identifiable information collected from cookies and IP addresses as described below. McKinsey may provide your personally-identifiable information to any of its affiliates worldwide for such purposes.</p>

<p>
4. McKinsey may disclose contact information for you in response to inquiries by bona-fide rights owners in connection with allegations of infringement of copyright or other proprietary rights arising from information you have posted on the Site or otherwise provided to McKinsey;</p>
<p>
5. If McKinsey and/or any of its affiliates merges with or sells substantially all of its assets or a majority of its equity to a third party, information collected by McKinsey or such affiliates on their Web sites may be disclosed to and owned by the merged entity or third party.</p></blockquote>
