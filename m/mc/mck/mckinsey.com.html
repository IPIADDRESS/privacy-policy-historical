McKinsey is committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personally-identifiable information, being any information that is capable of identifying you as an individual person, as you use this Site and the McKinsey Recruitment Portal.

<h3>McKinsey Recruitment Portal / McKinsey Retention Program</h3>
<p>To assist McKinsey with its staffing and recruitment, McKinsey has partnered with SalesForce.com to provide the McKinsey Recruitment Portal. If you provide information through the Recruitment Portal, your personally-identifiable information will be held on servers located in the US, managed by SalesForce.com. SalesForce.com has agreed to provide the same level of privacy and data protection that you enjoy when interacting with this Site and McKinsey generally.</p>
<p>Through the McKinsey Recruitment Portal, job candidates can apply for positions with McKinsey or sign up for the McKinsey Retention Program where you can be notified of any potential job openings or other similar opportunities that might be of interest to you.</p>
<p>McKinsey frequently visits recruiting websites and social networks such as LinkedIn. Where users of those websites have made their personally-identifiable information publically available, McKinsey sometimes collects this information for the McKinsey Retention Program. If you do not want McKinsey to retain your personally-identifiable information collected in this way, please opt-out of the McKinsey Retention Program when notified that your personally-identifiable information has been collected.</p>
<h3>Mobile Applications</h3>
<p>In connection with applications that we make available for mobile devices, McKinsey may use third-party services to track and analyze nonpersonally identifiable user activity in order to fix errors, monitor usage, and improve the performance of the applications. In particular, UrbanAirship tracks whether a user opened an application in response to a specific push notification. Omniture tracks and reports on some of our mobile applications’ usage and browsing patterns, including information about the type of device used, articles accessed, and other events occurring within our apps. Crittercism tracks certain errors occurring within mobile applications. None of these third parties gathers information in a manner intended to identify any particular user personally.</p>
<p>In addition, our McKinsey Insights app offers a personalized list of recommendations (called “Recommended for you”) pointing out McKinsey content we think you'll find interesting. Recommendations are based solely on what you've viewed in the Insights app. A unique user identifier that is generated by the app helps by personalizing your experience and tracking the articles you read. We do not share your viewing history or trends with other users or any third parties.</p>
<p>Our mobile applications may include integration with various social-networking sites, including Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, and Twitter. If you enable and use these features within an application, the extent to which your activities and information are tracked is governed by the relevant user agreement you have in place with such a third party.</p>
<h3>The Alumni Center, Newsletters, and Alerts </h3>
<p>By registering with our Alumni Center or for recurring McKinsey newsletters or alerts, you agree to receive on occasion other correspondence from McKinsey related to the subscribed newsletters and other McKinsey news and information that you consented to receive during registration. This type of information is shared externally only in anonymous, aggregated form for generalized user analysis or to enable third party agents to send e-mails to you on our behalf. You will be contacted by e-mail or otherwise only by McKinsey or it agents. </p>
<p>We ask for your e-mail address at registration. We will send e-mails to this address to confirm your registration, to provide newsletters or alerts and to contact you for any other reason. In addition, we may contact you regarding your account status. If you sign up to receive any of our newsletters, alerts, or surveys, you may on occasion receive other correspondence from McKinsey. Your e-mail address will not be shared with any third party other than an agent who has agreed to send e-mails on our behalf. </p>
<p>The Site also includes a feature that enables McKinsey to send links to its content through e-mail at our users' request. The e-mail address(es) that you supply in connection with this service will be used only to send the requested content. They will not be stored or reused for any purpose. </p>
<h3>Is personally-identifiable information disclosed to third parties? </h3>
<p>McKinsey shall not intentionally disclose or transfer (and shall take reasonable steps to prevent the unauthorized or accidental disclosure of) your personally-identifiable information to third parties (i.e., persons or entities that are not affiliates of McKinsey) without your consent, whether for such third parties’ marketing purposes or otherwise, except as follows. McKinsey may provide access to your personally-identifiable information to third party vendors engaged by McKinsey to provide services related to the Site; provided that such vendors will first agree to maintain the strict confidentiality of such information and provide the same level of data security as provided by McKinsey. McKinsey may also be compelled to surrender personal user or customer information to legal authorities without express user consent if presented with a court subpoena or similar legal order, or as required or permitted by the laws, rules, and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction.

<h3>User forums</h3>
<p>You should be aware that whenever you publicly disclose information online, that information could be collected and used by others. McKinsey is not responsible for any action or policies of any third parties who collect information that users publicly disclose in any such forums on the Site. </p>

Despite these precautions, McKinsey, however, cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not obtain access to your personally-identifiable information. </p>
<h3>Transborder hosting and transfer of information</h3>
<p>Personally-identifiable information collected on the Site may be transferred from time to time to McKinsey offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and the Site may be viewed and hosted by McKinsey or its vendors anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have the same data protection laws than what is found in your country of residence. By using the Site and registering such information on it, you voluntarily consent to such transborder transfer and hosting of such information. </p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with client engagements involving specific services, McKinsey’s United States entities have certified to the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework with respect to certain personal information about its clients’ personnel located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. McKinsey is aware that the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks may, in light of a 2015 ruling by the European Court of Justice, no longer constitute an adequate basis for the transfer of personal information to the United States. Nevertheless, McKinsey also believes that the Safe Harbor principles continue to represent important commitments for protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and McKinsey will continue to abide by these principles in the course of the specific services covered by its Safe Harbor certification, as well as with any other commitments made to its clients. For more information about McKinsey’s protection of such personal information and the process McKinsey follows, please refer to <a href="/org-solutions-privacy-statement">McKinsey’s privacy statement on certain international transfers</a>. </p>
