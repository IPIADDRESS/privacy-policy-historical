		<p>
								This privacy policy set out below forms part of these terms of use and sets out the way in which your personal data are handled. Therefore please read this policy carefully, as it explains what information we will collect about you, how we will use it, and the steps we take to ensure that it is kept safe.
							</p>
							<ul class="divided-list">
								<li>
									<h4>What information do we collect?</h4>
									<p>In order to provide you with our services, we may collect personal information about you from our website, telephone conversations, emails, and written and verbal communications. We may, for example, keep a record of your name, address, delivery address, email address, telephone number and credit card details. We may also record details of any disability or health needs you may have at the time of booking an event or service to help to ensure your safety.</p>
									<p>Information related to your visit to our website (such as which pages you visit, how often you visit and which competitions you enter) and the information you supply when becoming a registered user or when entering our competitions (such as your name and e-mail address) will be held and stored worldwide by us, and selected third parties.</p>
									<p>We may supplement the information that you provide with other information that we receive from third parties.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>How do we use your information?</h4>
									<p>Any personal data relating to you will be used and recorded by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this privacy policy.</p>
									<p>We will primarily use your personal information to provide our services and products to you. We will also use the personal information that we hold to communicate with you, for example: in the event that the services or products you have requested are unavailable; for record keeping purposes; to recover debt and to help us to prevent fraud; to improve the quality of our service; for market research; or to track activity on our website. If you have changed the settings in your personal profile to reflect your wishes in this respect we may also create an individual profile for you so that we can inform you of services, products, events or special offers that may be of interest to you.</p>
									<p>By supplying your information to us you confirm that you do not consider use of your information in accordance with this privacy policy to be a breach of any of your rights under the privacy and electronic communications (ec directive) regulations 2003.</p>
								
								</li>
								<li>								
									<h4>Disclosure of your information</h4>
									<p>If you change the settings in your personal profile to reflect your wishes in this respect, your personal information (including details of your purchasing preferences) may be shared with reputable third parties whose products/services we think will be of interest to you and those third parties may contact you directly to tell you about the products/information or we may contact you on their behalf. Each of these third parties may use your information as described under the section "how do we use your information?"
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Use of your information outside the european economic area</h4>
									<p>In order to provide you with the products and services you require, we may need to store or transfer your personal information to countries outside the european economic area, some of which do not protect privacy rights as extensively as in the united kingdom. This will include the holding of your personal data on the servers which host the website and which are located in the us.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>What to do if you do not want to receive marketing information</h4>
									<p>You have the right to prevent marketing information being sent direct to you.
