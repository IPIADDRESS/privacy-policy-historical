In addition, some information is shared with reputable organizations who may contact you with special offers of possible interest.</p>
<p>
	We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of our site.&nbsp; We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable.&nbsp; This process is known as de-personalizing your information.&nbsp; You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the site and our services (the “Analytical Data”).
