        Services, Inc. (the "Site").<br>
        <br>
        We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially 
        when conducting business.
        <br>
        This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the 
        Site ("Field Agents") who visit without transacting business and Field Agents 
        who register to conduct business on the Site and make use of the various 
        services offered by MSI Services, Inc. (collectively, "Services") ("Authorized 
        Independent Contractors").<br>
        <br>
        <b>"Personally Identifiable Information"</b>
        <br>
        refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, 
        or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not 
        limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial 
        profiles, date of birth, social security number, and photo identification. 
        Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is 
        collected anonymously (that is, without identification of the individual user) 
        or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.<br>
        <br>
        <b>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? </b>
        <br>
        We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Field Agents. We 
        collect the following additional information from our Authorized Independent 
        Contractors: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of 
        Authorized Independent Contractors, (Possibly add the application information 
        that is obtained such as education, other companies they shop for, date of birth 
        etc.)
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>What organizations are collecting the information? </b>
        <br>
        In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party service 
        vendors (such as clients we are providing services to that you as a Field Agent 
        may be performing an assignment for) who may provide such services as
        <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>hospitality, retail, grocery, healthcare, 
        insurance, property rentals(apartment associations), background checks, 
        financial services etc. may collect this information directly from our Field 
        Agents and Authorized Independent Contractors for identification purposes. We do 
        not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to 
        disclose how they use personal information provided to them from Field Agents 
        and Authorized Independent Contractors. Some of these third parties may be 
        intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain, and do not 
        store, retain, or use the information given to them.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br>
        We use Personally Identifiable Information to verify your identity, customize 
        the Site and to make appropriate service offerings. We may email Field Agents 
        and Authorized Independent Contractors about research or assignment 
        opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the 
        Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Field 
        Agents and Authorized Independent Contractors in response to specific inquiries, 
        or to provide requested information.

        be shared within the Site to compare with other Authorized Independent 
        Contractors who we wish to evaluate potential improvements with our Field Agent 
        Network of other Authorized Independent Contractors. We may share aggregated 
        information about our Field Agents, including the demographics of our Field 
        Agents and Authorized Independent Contractors, with our affiliated agencies and 
        third party vendors. We also offer the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving 
        information or being contacted by us on the Site. <o:p></o:p></span>

        Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information 
        about the preferences of our Field Agents and the services they select. We also

        We do not share personally identifiable information such as social security or

        Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law: We will

        <b>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?</b><br>
        All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and practices. The

        Independent Contractors is only accessible to a limited number of qualified 
        employees who are given a password in order to gain access to the information. 
        We audit our security systems and processes on a regular basis. Sensitive 
        information, such as direct deposit information or social security numbers, is 
        protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect information sent over the 
        Internet. While we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure 
        site, electronic communications and databases are subject to errors, tampering 
        and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not take 
        place and we will not be liable to Field Agents or Authorized Independent 
        Contractors for any such occurrences.

        <b>Can a Field Agent delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information

        We provide Field Agents and Authorized Independent Contractors with a mechanism

        <span style="font-size:
10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">because of 
        backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Field Agent's 
        entry without retaining some residual information. An individual who requests to 
        have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information 
        functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally 
        Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</b><br>
        We will let our Field Agents and Authorized Independent Contractors know about 
        changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if 
        we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of 
        Personally Identifiable Information that a Field Agent or Authorized Independent 
        Contractor has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Field 
        Agent or Authorized Independent Contractor to allow such Field Agent or 
        Authorized Independent Contractor to prevent such disclosure.
