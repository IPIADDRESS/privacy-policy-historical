                    <b>Introduction</b> - MSI Services, Inc. (“MSI”), is committed to protecting your
                    privacy. We have established this Privacy Policy and are providing it to you so
                    that you can understand the manner in which we collect and use your information
                    and the efforts we use to protect it. Please note that this policy is for The MSI
                    Website only and does not apply to other 3rd party web sites linked to from our
                    web site. Please check the privacy policies on those web sites for more information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Personal Information Collected</b> - MSI recognizes the need for consumers to
                    control the use and management of personal information. By personal information
                    we mean information that can be used to identify or contact an individual. This
                    may include, but is not limited to, a first and last name, a physical address, an
                    email address, or a phone number. If you are visiting our site to browse or find
                    information about MSI 's products or services, you do not need to provide any personal
                    information. If you require additional information, however, we may collect this
                    information so that we can provide you with the information you requested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Automatic Information Collected</b> - Our website makes use of various technologies
                    to collect information about types and versions of internet browsers used when accessing
                    our web site. This information, and information about internet IP addresses, as
                    well as date and time web pages are visited are stored in various security and traffic
                    logs. Our service provider reviews these logs, using statistical analysis, in an
                    effort to track and predict traffic patterns and estimate resource needs. Unless
                    we are tracking down a technical problem or we suspect either fraudulent behavior
                    or illegal conduct we do not trace specific user sessions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Personal Information Use</b> - MSI uses personal information provided by you
                    so that we can service your account. Also note that we may need to transfer that
                    information to our agents or employees of our service providers. We will not sell
                    or trade your information to unrelated third parties. When you submit a request
                    you will receive an email confirmation from our system. As your request status changes
                    you may also receive notifications via email. These notifications are considered
                    part of our service and may not be disabled. We may also periodically send you email
                    notifications concerning available projects. Any such notification will include
                    instructions for opting out of future mailings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Third Parties</b> - We may partner with other third parties to provide various
                    products and services. When you sign up for these services or products we will share
                    required personal information that is necessary for the third party to provide the
                    product or service to you. We take reasonable steps to ensure that these third parties
                    are obligated to protect your information on our behalf. It is also against our
                    policy to sell or trade information collected online without consent. We may, however,
                    release personal information if we are legally required to do so. If we are legally
                    compelled to release information to a third party, MSI may or may not notify you
                    of this release. Notification will be at the discretion of MSI and will be based
                    on the nature and conditions surrounding the release of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Information Control</b> - Your Field Agent profile is accessible from our website

                    <b>Children</b> - The MSI website is targeted to mature adults and is not meant

                    we know to be under thirteen years of age. If you are the parent or guardian of
                    a child under thirteen years of age and believe that your child has disclosed personally
                    identifiable information to us, please contact us so that we may remove the child's
                    information.

                    <b>Supplemental Technologies</b> - Our website uses cookies, session identifiers,
                    JavaScript(tm), and browser detection technology to provide consumers with a more
                    pleasant online experience. Many browsers provide consumers with the ability to
                    disable some or all of these technologies. Disabling them, especially in the case
                    of JavaScript(tm), may prevent you from viewing some web pages. Note that the cookies
                    we use do not place any personally identifiable information on your computer.
                </p>

                    <b>Confidentiality and Security</b> - MSI takes reasonable steps to ensure that
                    your information is protected. Internally, we limit access to your information to
                    those employees or agents who we believe have reasonable need to use the information
                    to provide products or services to you, or to perform their jobs.
                </p>
                <p>

                    to service your MSI account. These notifications are considered part of our service

                    your address changes.
