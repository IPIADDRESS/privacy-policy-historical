        string of text a web site sends to your browser. It can't retrieve any
        data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your

        in general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, personalize

    <td> MSC.Software has instituted secure server software (SSL) to protect
      your Internet transactions. When you place orders or access your account
      information we use the secure server software to encrypt all your personal
      information, including credit card numbers, so they cannot be read during
      Internet transmission. To confirm this, when you enter personal information
      during the registration or ordering processes, your browser will indicate
      that you've entered a secure page environment (look for a "lock" icon,
      and/or you will see that the URL has changed to from "http:" to "https").</td>

    <td><p> We use a secure licensed system for credit card authorization and

        credit card service and referenced by your order number. We don't store
