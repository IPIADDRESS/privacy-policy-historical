<h3><b><a name="privacy"></a>MSC.Software Website Privacy Policy</b></h3>
<p><b>MSC.Software Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us, and we take our privacy commitment to 
  our website users very seriously. Our goal is to protect your online privacy 
  while delivering a useful and enjoyable online experience that provides the

    <u>Sending You Information</u>: Our policy is to obtain your permission to send you 
    information about MSC.Software or our business partners. On pages on this 
    site where we collect contact information (for example, our user registration 
    pages), we give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving certain 
    information from MSC.Software and/or our business partners. This includes 
    the option to decline to receive such information as updates on products and 
    services, special promotions, and newsletters from various MSC.Software sites. 
    You may also contact us to inquire about these matters, or add or remove your 
    name from our contact lists, by sending an email to www@mscsoftware.com

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p><u>What is a cookie?</u> Cookies were originally designed to help a web site identify 
  a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences 
  that were set before. A cookie is a small string of text a web site sends to 
  your browser. It can't retrieve any data from your hard drive, pass on computer 
  viruses, or capture your E-mail address. Many web sites use cookies to enhance 
  the user's visit; in general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, 
  personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or 
  keep track of selections in a "shopping cart." </p>
<p><u>How do we use cookies?</u> We use transient or "session" cookies to track 
  a registered user's session. A session cookie is a small file that contains 
  information about a user that disappears when the user's browser is closed. 
  Unlike a persistent cookie, a transient cookie is not stored on your hard drive. 
  It is only stored in temporary memory and is erased once the browser is closed. 
  Users who have registered memberships with any of the Engineering-e.com sites 
  or subscribed to any applications will need to have their browser enabled to 
  accept cookies in order to access sections of each Engineering-e.com site.</p>
<p>Engineering-e.com uses session cookies for a number of purposes, such as to 
  allow a user access to his or her information at the time of signing in or to 
  use tools or services available only to members. Engineering-e.com requires 
  you to sign in after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against 
  others accidentally accessing the contents of your account.</p>
<p>If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Engineering-e.com's 
  products or services that require you to "sign in." It is also likely 
  that you may not be able to take full advantage of each site's offerings.</p>
<p>We may use the information we get from cookies to evaluate and improve our 
  web site. We won't use the information transferred through cookies for promotion 
  or marketing purposes, and it won't be shared with third parties. </p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>MSC.Software has instituted secure server software (SSL) to protect your Internet 
  transactions. When you place orders or access your account information we use 
  the secure server software to encrypt all your personal information, including 
  credit card numbers, so they cannot be read during Internet transmission. To 
  confirm this, when you enter personal information during the registration or 
  ordering processes, your browser will indicate that you've entered a secure 
  page environment (look for a "lock" icon, and/or you will see that 
  the URL has changed to from "http:" to "https").</p>
<p>We use a secure licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. 
  Your credit card information is sent directly to our credit card service and 
  referenced by your order number. We don't store your credit card information 
  on our web site. </p>
<p>For further details about security on this MSC.Software site, please see our 
  Security Policy.</p>
<p> <b>Your Ability to Review or Change Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>We encourage our users to update and edit their personal information and keep 
  it current. To do so, please go to the <a href="https://www.engineering-e.com/cgi-bin/register/signinform.pl?CASE=protected&amp;refer=https://www.engineering-e.com/misc/member_services.cfm?" target="_blank">Member 
  Services</a> page.</p>
<p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>
<p>As a convenience to you, we sometimes provide links to other, non-MSC.Software 
  websites. These sites are not under the control of MSC.Software, and the fact 
  that MSC.Software provides such links is not an indication that we endorse or 
  are liable for those sites or their content. This Privacy Policy does not cover 
  those linked sites. If you provide information to those companies' sites, that 
  information will be subject to their privacy policies.</p>
<p><b>Questions and Concerns</b></p>
