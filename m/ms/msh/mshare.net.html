InMoment is a software as a service (SaaS) provider for companies conducting data collection activities via telephone, the Internet, text messaging, comment cards, mystery shopping, internal audits and other data collection methods. Following collection, the information is analyzed and reported on. These activities are primarily targeting customer and employee satisfaction issues, but may also include market, product, and service research, as well as other types of research. Surveys and data collection may be hosted and accessible on InMoment’s ASP Hosting site, or on our clients’ own hosting sites. Reports are processed and printed each day that may provide our clients with your Personal Information for the purpose of improving their operations and/or contacting you to follow up on your service experience, and/or the information you provided. Be aware that InMoment’s clients have full access to the data, and therefore bear full responsibility for usage of that data. In such cases, please refer to the privacy policy of the InMoment client who invited you to provide information and feedback.</p>
<p><strong>What is Personal Information?</strong><br>
Personal Information is information about an identifiable individual. It may include your full name, address, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, email address, demographic/classification information (e.g. education or age), and any other information that identifies who you are or would allow someone to contact you. It also may include client program membership or loyalty numbers. Your contact information may be used as required to follow up on your feedback so you can be contacted by client employees or representatives. Personal Information only becomes known to InMoment when you voluntarily provide it to us, or it is provided to InMoment by the InMoment client that invited you to take a survey.</p>
<p><strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong><br>
We will not collect any Personal Information from you that you do not volunteer. Participation in surveys or other data collection is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to respond and whether or not to disclose any requested information. We do not sell, share, or rent Personal Information to third parties unless you expressly agree to have InMoment share your Personal Information as described below.</p>
<p>If you choose to take a survey, register, or submit personally identifiable information to us, you agree to the use of such information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you elect not to provide your Personal Information to us, you will be ineligible to participate in any incentive contest that is offered on the Sites. If you have already submitted Personal Information and would like us to remove it from our records, or if you would like to know what Personal Information is held in our records, see the Contact section below.</p>
<p><strong>Telephone ANI Visibility</strong><br>
When you dial a toll-free number in the United States, the party you are calling pays for the call. The called party is able to identify your telephone number using a telephone network technology called Automatic Number Identification (ANI). FCC rules limit parties that own toll-free numbers from distributing the telephone numbers identified through ANI and require telephone companies to inform customers that their telephone numbers are being transmitted to toll-free numbers in this way. If you take a InMoment telephone survey, both InMoment and its clients may have access to your ANI, but, per FCC rules, will not distribute that telephone number further.</p>

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Sites. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. Our Sites may use cookies to make sure you don’t access the same survey repeatedly and to determine the browser the visitor uses so the Sites can be designed to work properly with the most common versions of different browsers.
