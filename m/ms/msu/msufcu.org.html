	Certain limitations exist for electronic fund transfers to protect against possible losses.

</ul>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Bill Paying Process</strong><br>
	Single Payments - a single payment will be processed on the business day (generally Monday through Friday, except certain holidays) that you designate as the payment process date, provided the payment is submitted prior to the daily cut-off time on that date.<br>
	<br>
	The daily cut-off time, which is controlled by the Credit Union, is currently 4:30 p.m. EST.<br>
	<br>
	A single payment submitted after the cut-off time on the designated process date will be processed on the next business day. If you designate a non-business date (generally weekends and certain holidays) as the paymentâs process date, the payment will be processed on the first business day following the designated process date. </font></span></p>
<br>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recurring Payments - When a recurring payment is processed, it is automatically rescheduled by the system. Based upon your selected frequency settings for the payment, a process date is calculated for the next occurrence of the payment. If the calculated process date is a non-business date (generally weekends and certain holidays), it is adjusted based upon the following rules: </font></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the recurring payment's "Pay Before" option is selected, the process date for the new occurrence of the payment is adjusted to the first business date prior to the calculated </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">process date.</font></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the recurring payment's "Pay After" option is selected, the process date for the new occurrence of the payment is adjusted to the first business date after the calculated process date.</font></span></li>
</ul>

	<span style="font-size: 12px">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Note:</strong> If your frequency settings for the recurring payment specify the 29th, 30th, or 31st as </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a particular day of the month for processing and that day does not exist in the month of the </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">calculated process date, then the last calendar day of that month is used as the calculated </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">process date.</font></span></p>

		There is a charge for each stop payment order. We reserve the right to impose a reasonable charge, or to increase such charges, in the future. Please see our Fee Schedule to determine the current stop payment fee.<br>
		<br>
		If these regular payments vary in amount, the person you are<br>
		going to pay will tell you 10 days before each payment<span> </span>when it will be made and how much it will be. You may choose instead to get this notice only when your payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set; if so, you must make the necessary arrangements with the person you are going to pay.<br>
		<br>
		If you order us to stop one of these payments three (3) business days<span> </span>or more before the transfer is scheduled and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages.<br>

	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Dividends paid on the Insured Money Management Account (IMMA)&nbsp;will be calculated on the daily balance in the account and will be paid at the end of each month. The dividend rate will be declared each business day based on investments made by MSUFCU&nbsp;on a day-to-day basis under guidelines established by an investment committee and approved by the board of directors. The minimum balance in the account is $2,000. Dividends will not be earned for any day in which the minimum balance of $2,000 is not maintained. Additional deposits, other than dividends, can be made at any time.<br>
	<br>
	MSUFCU, on request, will provide checks to be used for withdrawals from the account. The credit union is authorized to pay checks signed by IMMA account holders and to charge all such checks against funds in this account. It is further understood that&nbsp;MSUFCU is under no obligation to pay a check that exceeds the balance in this account and that only checks or other withdrawal methods approved by the credit union may be used to make withdrawals from the account.<br>
	<br>
	The credit union may pay a check on any day it is presented for payment and checks, when paid, become the property of&nbsp;MSUFCU and will not be returned with your account statements. Copies may be obtained of any paid check for a fee.<br>
	<br>
	Except for negligence, the credit union is not liable for any action it takes regarding payment or non-payment of a check. Checks must be written for no less than $500.<br>
	<br>
	Any check that cannot be paid due to insufficient funds in the Insured Money Management Account will be returned to the payee and an insufficient fund fee applicable at the time of presentation will be assessed. This fee applies to each check presented for payment when funds are not available.<br>
	<br>
	The credit union will accept written or ComputerLine stop payment orders on individual checks or a series of checks. The written stop payment order will remain in effect for a period of up to six (6) months or until canceled. A stop payment will be placed immediately upon receipt of the request, but the credit union will not be responsible for checks paid prior to or within the 24 hour period immediately following the stop payment request. For each stop payment request, a stop payment fee will be assessed.<br>
	<br>
	Each individual&nbsp;IMMA&nbsp;is limited to a total of six (6) electronic and phone withdrawals per calendar month. These withdrawals include:</span></span></p>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Transfers within ComputerLine and Green on the Go<sup>Â®</sup> mobile banking, including scheduled share to share transfers</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Transfers made by phone, including those using MoneyLine and those made by a phone representative of MSUFCU</span></span></li>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The number of these types of withdrawals made per month reduces the number of permitted telephone or electronic transfers for the duration of the month. For example, if two checks clear your IMMA in one month, then only four telephone or&nbsp;ComputerLine transfers&nbsp;may be&nbsp;made that same month.<br>
	<br>
	There is no limit on the number of IMMA withdrawals initiated at an ATM, made in person, or received by mail.<br>
	<br>
	Periodic statements will be provided to depositors monthly or at the credit union's convenience. Any objection to an item or items appearing on a periodic statement will not be considered valid unless made in writing to the credit union within 60 days of the date the statement is mailed.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	MSUFCU is authorized to recognize the primary and all joint members on an account as owners of the IMMA, and all account holders may access the IMMA for purposes of withdrawal or deposit. Joint IMMA account holders hereby agree with each other and with&nbsp;MSUFCU that all sums now paid on deposit or heretofore paid on deposit by any or all of the owners to their credit as joint owners with all accumulation of dividends therein, are and shall be owned by them jointly, with right of survivorship and be subject to withdrawal or receipt of any of them, and payment to any of them or the survivor shall be&nbsp;paid and discharge the credit union from any liability for such payment.<br>
	<br>
	Use of the Insured Money Management Account is subject to federal and state laws and regulations and other items, conditions, restrictions, and requirements as the credit union may establish from time-to-time. The agreement/disclosure governing the use of the Insured Money Management Account may be amended at any time as necessary by the credit union by posting a notice of amendment in a conspicuous place in the credit union's branch&nbsp;lobbies&nbsp;and on our website&nbsp;and will become effective immediately upon posting.<br>
	<br>
	MSUFCU reserves the right to refuse accounts and/or the use of the Insured Money Management Account at its discretion, and to terminate the deposit relationship at any time and without notice.<br>
	<br>
	The credit union also reserves the right to require at least a seven (7) day notice of withdrawal.<br>
	<br>
	IMMA accounts have multiple tiers. The larger the deposit in the account, the higher the rate.<br>
	$2,000-$9,999.99<br>
	$10,000-$49,999.99<br>
	$50,000-$99,999.99<br>

	<p>
		<br>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px">C. If an early withdrawal reduces the certificate below the required minimum balance, the certificate will be canceled and a penalty charged on the full balance using the appropriate above method.</span></span></span></p>

		<br>
		<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px">The above penalties do not apply if your withdrawal is made as part of an established automatic distribution plan, as an IRS required withdrawal after age 70 1/2, or if you die, or become disabled.

If you cannot furnish your taxpayer identification number (TIN) to us, we may not permit you to open an account until you can provide us with it. Incorrect TINs may cause backup withholding.

Two or more people or entities jointly owning an account are considered a multiple party account and create a "joint tenancy with rights of survivorship<span>.</span>" Except as modified in this Agreement, joint accounts shall be subject to and governed by PA 41 of the Public Acts of 1968, as amended, being MCLA 490.51, and commonly known as the Credit Union Multiple-Party Accounts Act.</span></span></p>

Any owner is allowed and deemed to have the authority to act on behalf of any other account owner(s) with respect to any and all account transactions. Each owner guarantees the signature of any other owner(s). Each owner appoints the other owner to be his/her irrevocable attorney. An owner does not need permission from the other owner(s) in order to withdraw funds, request stop payment on items or authorize a transfer of all, or any part, of the savings. We are not obligated to inform any owner(s) about any transaction, except as required by law. We require signatures from all owners authorizing any material changes of the account. If we are informed, in writing, of a disagreement between account owners, or if there is a conflict in directions, between owners, on how to handle an account, we may place a hold on all funds in the account or close the account, or require a court order or written permission from all owners before taking any action with respect to the account.</span></span></p>

If a deposited item in a multiple party account is returned due to insufficient funds, the account is overdrawn or a final payment is not made on a transaction, the owners, jointly and severally, are responsible for reimbursing us the amount of the returned item, overdraft or unpaid item and any fees that may be assessed, no matter who approved or initiated the transaction. We may exercise our rights against any account of any owner and any funds in the multiple party account to obtain reimbursement from any account owner indebted to us, regardless of who contributed such funds to the account.</span></span></p>

When one owner of a multiple party account dies, all rights and available funds in the account fall to the remaining account owner(s), unless otherwise authorized on the Membership Agreement. If a surviving owner does not exist, the last deceased ownerâs interest will go to his or her estate. If a surviving owner does exist, his or her share of the account is subject to any financial obligations, security interest or pledge authorized by the decedent, even if the surviving owner did not agree to it.</span></span></p>

Any joint owner shall be jointly and severally liable to us for any returned item, overdraft or unpaid transaction on the minorâs account. Transactions may be handled and dividends paid without approval from the co-owner of legal age. A parent or guardian is not permitted to access the minorâs account unless he or she is the joint owner on the account.

A Uniform Transfers to Minors Account (UTMA) is set up by a member, who shall be recognized as the custodian of the account, who deposits funds into the account as a gift to a minor. The minor is the recipient of the custodial funds in the account. The custodian holds proprietary rights and control of the account for the sole privilege and advantage of the minor and until the minor reaches the age of majority. The custodian is the only party authorized to contribute or withdraw funds or close the account, unless otherwise ordered by the court. We are not required to question the use or purpose of any transaction. We may delay any withdrawals from the account if the custodian dies until we have been instructed by any person permitted by law to withdraw funds, or a court orders us to make a withdrawal.</span></span></p>

A Payable on Death (POD) Account is established in order to designate any surviving POD beneficiary/payee of a single or multiple party account, excluding<span> Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)</span>. If more than one POD or beneficiary/payee is named, the ownership of account benefits passes to all such beneficiaries/payees, without rights of survivorship. Designation of a beneficiary/payee for IRAs<span> </span>and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) is separate from and does not apply to POD designations. We are not required to inform the beneficiary/payee of the establishment of any such account or his or her vesting interest in any account, unless required by law. If no person designated as a POD beneficiary/payee is living at the time of the death of the last surviving owner, the account shall be considered part of the ownerâs estate.</span></span></p>

MSUFCU offers accounts for trusts and other entities such as estates, organizations, associations, sole proprietorships, corporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships that qualify for membership. These types of accounts are governed by separate account agreements specific to the type of entity and account. This Agreement does not apply to such accounts.</span></span></p>

An instruction given to MSUFCU by an account owner that permits another person to transact business on specified accounts is a designation of an account agent. A designation does not give the agent any ownership rights in an account or voting privileges with MSUFCU.

Transfers, checks, drafts and other items may be received for deposit into any of your accounts if they are payable to, or to the order of, one or more account owner(s), even if all payees fail to endorse them. If we choose, we may furnish missing endorsements of any owner. If a check, draft or item that is payable to two or more owners is unclear as to whether it is made out to either or both, we may process that check, draft or item as though it is payable to either person. When you deposit items into your account, you warrant that all prior endorsements are genuine. MSUFCU reserves the right to verify all endorsements on third party checks presented for payment or deposit either in person or by comparison with Member Account Agreements. If an insurance check, a government check or other check or draft specifies endorsement requirements on the back of the check or draft, we may require exact endorsement as stated on the item. We require that endorsements be made on the back of the share draft or check within 1 inch from the upper edge, but we may choose to receive items that have been endorsed outside of that space. However, you are liable for any loss we incur from any delay or processing error due to an incorrect endorsement or other marks made by you or any previous endorser. MSUFCU may disregard information on any check other than the signature of the drawer and amount of the item and any magnetic encoded information. You agree that MSUFCU does not fail to use ordinary care in paying an item solely because its procedures do not provide for sight examination of items.</span></span></p>

We do not claim responsibility for a deposit made by mail or at an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) until the item is in our possession. We are not accountable for any mishandling of an item by another party or its loss in transit. Each separate party will only be accountable for its own negligence. We reserve the right to send any item for collection. Items drawn on an institution not located in the United States are exclusively processed on a collection basis. You forgo the right to any notice of nonpayment, presentment, protest or dishonor regarding the items we buy or acquire for credit or collection to your account.</span></span></p>

You must approve each direct deposit or automatic transfer beforehand by completing a form provided by us or the organization from which you receive the payment. A separate form must be completed for each direct deposit or automatic transfer. To cancel or modify a direct deposit or automatic transfer, you must notify the organization from which the payment is originated. If applicable, you must notify MSUFCU at least thirty (30) days prior to any direct deposit or preapproved transfer if you wish to cancel or change the direct deposit or transfer. If you file for bankruptcy, all direct deposits that you have authorized will remain unchanged unless you cancel them.

When you order a wire transfer, you may specify either the recipient or any financial institution by name, an account number or identifying number.

Regardless of whether we pay the item or reject it, you agree to pay any fee we may assess to your account as stated in the Fee Schedule. Except as noted in a written agreement, we, by paying one or any overdraft, do not consent to honor overdrafts in the future and may cease paying overdrafts at any time, without notice. If we cover a check or charge a fee that would overdraw your account, you promise to repay the overdrawn amount to us immediately. We have the right to seek collection of earlier dishonored items not covered, at any time, including granting a payer bank additional time past any deadline.</span></span></p>

			<br>
			Important Information Regarding Your MSUFCU Checking Accounts.<br>
			<br>
			What is a substitute check? To make check processing faster, federal law permits banks to replace original checks with âsubstitute checksâ or electronic checks. These checks are similar in size to original checks with a slightly reduced image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states: âThis is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check.â You may use a substitute check as proof of payment just like the original check.</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">MSUFCU members do not receive their canceled checks. Those who avail themselves of ComputerLine may view their canceled checks through our check imaging system. Because of the Check 21 Act, when online, you may view copies of substitute checks. You may copy this check as proof of payment should you need to. Occasionally you may request a copy of a check from us because it is necessary as proof of payment. This notice describes rights you have when you receive substitute checks from us. The rights in this notice do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits to your account. However, you have rights under other laws with respect to those transactions.</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">What are my rights regarding substitute checks? In certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you suffer if a substitute check is posted to your account (for example, if you think that we withdrew the wrong amount from your account or that we withdrew money from your account more than once for the same check). The losses you may attempt to recover under this procedure may include the amount that was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal (for example, bounced check fees).</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The amount of your refund under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You also are entitled to interest on the amount of your refund if your account is an interest-bearing account. If your loss exceeds the amount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other law. If you use this procedure, you may receive up to $2,500 of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) within 10 business days after we received your claim and the remainder of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) not later than 45 calendar days after we received your claim. We may reverse the refund (including any interest on the refund) if we later are able to demonstrate that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account.<br>
			<br>
			How do I make a claim for a refund? If you believe that you have suffered a loss relating to a substitute check that you received and that was posted to your account, please contact us at MSUFCU; Specialty and Support Services; PO Box 1208; East Lansing, MI 48826-1208; by calling 517-333-2424 or toll-free 800-678-4968, or online at www.msufcu.org. You must contact us within 40 calendar days of the date that we mailed (or otherwise delivered by a means to which you agreed) the substitute check in question or the account statement showing that the substitute check was posted to your account, whichever is later. We will extend this time period if you were not able to make a timely claim because of extraordinary circumstances.<br>
			Your claim must include:</span></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">A description of why you have suffered a loss (for example, you<br>

In addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period if there is an emergency such as failure of communications or computer equipment. Should such an emergency occur, we will notify you and tell you when the funds will be available. They will generally be available no later than the seventh business day after the day of your deposit.</span></span></p>
