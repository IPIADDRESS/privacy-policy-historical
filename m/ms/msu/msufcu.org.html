		<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This is your Bill Payment agreement with Michigan State University Federal Credit Union and Oakland University Credit Union.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Oakland University Credit Union, OUCU, is a licensed trade name of Michigan State University Federal Credit Union. While some of your account materials may reflect the OUCU logo, MSU Federal Credit Union remains the legal entity behind both brands, MSUFCU and OUCU. Your legal documents and Federal Reserve transactions will be listed in your account as MSU Federal Credit Union (“Credit Union”).</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You may use the Credit Union Bill Payment service to direct the Credit Union to make payments from your designated checking account to the "Payees" you choose in accordance with this agreement. The terms and conditions of this agreement are in addition to the account agreements, disclosures and other documents in effect from time to time governing your account (The Account Rules).</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">"You" or "Your" means each person who is authorized to use the service. "Payee" means anyone, including the Credit Union, you designate and the Credit Union accepts as a "Payee."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Service Fees</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">See the Credit Union’s <a href="../../../../../../disclosures/?expand=fee_schedule#fee_schedule">Fee Schedule</a> for fees that may apply.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Limitations of "Electronic Fund Transfers"</strong><br>
Certain limitations exist for electronic fund transfers to protect against possible losses. ACH transactions and transfers are limited to $25,000 per day and email payments are limited to $10,000 per day. These limits are dependent on your account status with the Credit Union and are subject to change.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>The Bill Paying Process</strong><br>
Single Payments - a single payment will be processed on the business day (generally Monday through Friday, except certain holidays) that you designate as the payment process date, provided the payment is submitted prior to the daily cut-off time on that date.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The daily cut-off time, which is controlled by the Credit Union, is currently 4:30 p.m. EST.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A single payment submitted after the cut-off time on the designated process date will be processed on the next business day. If you designate a non-business date (generally weekends and certain holidays) as the payment’s process date, the payment will be processed on the first business day following the designated process date.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Recurring Payments - When a recurring payment is processed, it is automatically rescheduled by the system. Based upon your selected frequency settings for the payment, a process date is calculated for the next occurrence of the payment. If the calculated process date is a non-business date (generally weekends and certain holidays), it is adjusted based upon the following rules:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If the recurring payment's "Pay Before" option is selected, the process date for the new occurrence of the payment is adjusted to the first business date prior to the calculated process date.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If the recurring payment's "Pay After" option is selected, the process date for the new occurrence of the payment is adjusted to the first business date after the calculated process date.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Note:</strong> If your frequency settings for the recurring payment specify the 29th, 30th, or 31st as a particular day of the month for processing and that day does not exist in the month of the calculated process date, then the last calendar day of that month is used as the calculated process date.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Single and Recurring Payments </strong><br>
The system will calculate the Estimated Arrival Date of your payment. This is only an estimate. Please allow ample time for your payments to reach your "Payees."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Cancelling a Payment </strong><br>
A bill payment can be changed or cancelled anytime prior to the cutoff time on the scheduled process date.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Available Funds </strong><br>
You agree to have available and collected funds on deposit in the account you designate in amounts sufficient to pay for all bill payments requested, as well as, any other payment obligations you have to the Credit Union.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Credit Union reserves the right, without liability, to reject or reverse a bill payment if you fail to comply with the above requirement or any other term of this agreement.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you do not have sufficient funds in the account and the Credit Union has not exercised its right to reverse or reject a bill payment, you agree to pay for such payment obligations on demand.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You further agree the Credit Union, at its option, may charge any of your accounts with the Credit Union to cover such payment obligations.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Credit Union reserves the right to change the cut-off time. You will receive notice if it changes.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Liability</strong><br>
You are liable for all transactions you make or that you authorize another person to make even if that person exceeds his or her authority.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You will be responsible for any bill payment request you make that contains an error or is a duplicate of another bill payment.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Credit Union is not responsible for a bill payment that is not made if you did not properly follow the instructions for making a bill payment.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Credit Union is not liable for any failure to make a bill payment if you fail to promptly notify the Credit Union after you learn that you have not received credit from a "Payee" for a bill payment.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Credit Union is not responsible for your acts or omissions or those of any other person, including, without limitation, any transmission or communications facility, and no such party shall be deemed to be the Credit Union's agent.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In any event, the Credit Union will not be liable for any special, consequential, incidental, punitive losses, damages, or expenses in connection with this agreement or the service, even if the Credit Union has knowledge of the possibility of them.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Credit Union is not liable for any act, failure to act or delay in acting if it is caused, in whole or in part, by any cause beyond the Credit Union's reasonable control.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Amendment Termination </strong><br>
The Credit Union has the right to change this agreement at any time by notice mailed to you at the last address shown for the account on the Credit Union's records, by posting notice in branches of the Credit Union, or as otherwise permitted by law.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Credit Union has the right to terminate this agreement at any time.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Credit Union is not responsible for any fixed payment made before the Credit Union has a reasonable opportunity to act on your termination notice.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You remain obligated for any payments made by the Credit Union on your behalf.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Miscellaneous Product Fees </strong><br>
Fees will be assessed when extra services are requested: Overnight Fee, 2nd Day Fee, Second Day Economy (Electronic Payments Only), Charitable Donations and Gift Pay.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Credit Union reserves the right to charge you for research time involving payments no longer available in your screen history.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You will be informed of any such charges before they are incurred. Bill payments are processed by Electronic Fund Transfers (EFT). Please see the Electronic Fund Transfers Disclosure Statement included, or, received when you opened your account, which discloses important information concerning your rights and obligations.</span></span></p>				<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The words "we," "us," and "our" mean the Michigan State University Federal Credit Union. The word "account" means any one or more deposit or loan accounts you have with the Credit Union. The word "member" means any natural person, business, organization, or other legal entity.

By using the eDeposit service or clicking the electronic signature "acceptance" Member and any joint owners or authorized users, jointly and severally, agree to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, and any amendments.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This eDeposit service is offered for the purpose of converting original checks to substitute checks, as such term is defined in the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act and Federal Reserve Board Regulation CC ("Check 21"), for deposit with Credit Union and for processing and presentment to a collecting or paying financial institution. eDeposit is subject to the following terms and conditions and to the instructions, rules and terms contained in the eDeposit Help File provided to you via a link within the service and incorporated by reference herein.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">1. eDeposit Service.</span></span></strong><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>1.1 eDeposit Check Capture Process. </strong>Member will scan checks or drafts ("items") with an image capture device ("Scanner") creating an electronic image and Member will transmit an electronic file of such electronic images that the Credit Union will deposit to Member's account. The Credit Union's processing agent shall perform an image quality assessment of scanned checks or items and shall convert items meeting the Credit Union's required standards into substitute checks to facilitate the deposit and collection of such items. Member agrees that the manner in which items (e.g., substitute check, image exchange, ACH) are cleared or presented for payment shall be determined by Credit Union, in its sole discretion. Credit Union reserves the right to select the clearing agents through which Credit Union clears items. Member agrees to be bound by any clearinghouse agreements, operating circulars and image exchange agreements to which Credit Union is a party.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>1.2 Funds Availability. </strong>Funds from deposited items will be available according to Credit Union's Regulation CC funds availability disclosure, as amended from time to time, which is incorporated herein by reference. For purposes of determining the availability of funds, checks deposited via eDeposit session are considered received by the Credit Union when the eDeposit check capture system expressly indicates that the checks were received by or delivered to Credit Union. Member agrees that the scanning and transmitting of checks does not constitute receipt by Credit Union. Checks scanned and transmitted via eDeposit will be considered received by the Credit Union on the day of receipt. For the purpose of establishing funds availability, the Member's deposits via eDeposit are deemed to be received by the Credit Union at the time the system indicates a successful transaction is completed. Acknowledgment of receipt or delivery does not constitute an acknowledgment by Credit Union that the transmission of a check or items does not contain errors.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>1.3 Deposit Acceptance.</strong> Member agrees that Credit Union may at any time, in its sole discretion, refuse to accept deposits of Checks from Member via eDeposit. In the event that eDeposit check capture services are interrupted or are otherwise unavailable, Member may, at its option, deposit checks in-person at a Credit Union branch or via night drop or mail or other contractually acceptable method.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>2. Member Account.</strong><br>
<strong>2.1 Member Account.</strong> Member will designate a Credit Union savings, checking or loan account as the settlement account to be used for the purposes of settling, in aggregate, the financial transactions requested in connection with the eDeposit service. The Credit Union shall provide Member with details of the specific transactions, reported similarly as other transactions may be done, that were a result of access to the service. Member shall be responsible for auditing and balancing of any settlement account.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>2.2 Responsibility for Scanning.</strong> Member is solely responsible for scanning deposit items, accessing the service from the Credit Union and for maintaining Member's scanning equipment. Member will be responsible for the payment of all telecommunications expenses associated with the service. Credit Union shall not be responsible for providing or servicing any equipment for Member.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>2.3 Hardware and Software Requirements.</strong> The eDeposit Check Capture Process has specific hardware and software requirements in order to properly use this service. These requirements are specified on the Credit Union's webpage at www.msufcu.org under the frequently asked questions section of the eDeposit page.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>2.4 Deposit Requirements.</strong> Member agrees that it will only use eDeposit to deposit checks drawn on financial institutions within the United States, excluding its territories. Member will deposit checks not falling within this requirement in person, using a night drop facility or by U.S. mail accompanied by written instructions including but not limited to the account number for said deposit to be posted to. Member agrees that each check it submits for deposit through the eDeposit check capture service will meet the image quality standards established in American National Standards Institute's standard DSTUX9.37-2003. Each image of each check shall be of such quality that the following information can clearly be read and understood by sight review of such image:</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the amount of the check;<br>
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the payee of the check;<br>
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the signature of the drawer of the check;<br>
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the date of the check;<br>
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the check number;<br>
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the information identifying the drawer and the paying financial institution that is preprinted on the check, including the MICR line; and<br>
g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all other information placed on the check prior to the time an image of the Check is captured, such as any required identification written on the front of the Check and any endorsements applied to the back of the Check.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>2.5 Check Retention &amp; Destruction. </strong>Member agrees that all items belong to Member and not to Credit Union and that those items shall be handled in accordance with this Agreement and the Help File. After receipt by Credit Union of any transmission by Member of imaged items for deposit to Member's account, Credit Union will acknowledge by electronic means its receipt of such electronic transmission. Member's electronic transmission is subject to proof and verification. Member shall retain the original of all imaged items that have been deposited via eDeposit for reasonable period of time in order to verify settlement and credit or to balance periodic statements, but in no case beyond ninety (90) days from the date processed, and shall properly destroy and dispose of such original checks after such time. During the period that the Member maintains the original checks, the Member understands and agrees that it must use a high degree of care to protect these original checks against security risks. These risks include, without limitation, (i) theft or reproduction of the original checks (including by employees) for purposes of presentment for deposit of these original checks (i.e., after the original checks have already been presented for deposit via the eDeposit check capture service) and (ii) unauthorized use of information derived from the original checks. When Member destroys, and disposes of, the original checks pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement, the Member understands and agrees that it must use a high degree of care when selecting and implementing destruction and disposal procedures. Among other things, these procedures must be designed to ensure that the original checks are not accessed by unauthorized persons during the destruction and disposal process and, once destroyed, the original checks are no longer readable or capable of being reconstructed (e.g., through the use of competent shredding equipment.)</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>2.6 Presentment Prohibitions.</strong> The Member shall not present, or attempt to present, or allow others, either directly or indirectly, to present, or attempt to present, for deposit by any means (i) any Substitute Check that has already been presented for deposit via eDeposit or (ii) any original check, the Substitute Check of which has already been presented for deposit via eDeposit. In the event that the Member, or any third party, presents, or attempts to present, a deposit in violation of this Subsection the Member agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Credit Union and it's agents harmless from and against all liability, damage and loss arising out of any claims, suits, or demands brought by third parties with respect to any such Substitute Check or original check. Member agrees that the aggregate amount of any items which are deposited more than once will be debited from Member's account, and to the extent funds in Member's account are insufficient to cover such amount, any balance shall be debited by Credit Union from any other deposit accounts with Credit Union in its sole discretion. Member further acknowledges that Member and not the Credit Union is responsible for the processing and handling of any original items which are imaged and deposited utilizing the service and Member assumes all liability to the drawer of any item imaged using the service or liability arising from the Credit Union's printing of any substitute check from those images.</span></span><br>

Member assumes exclusive responsibility for the consequences of any instructions it may give to the Credit Union, for Member's failures to access the service properly in a manner prescribed by the Credit Union, and for Member's failure to supply accurate input information, including, without limitation, any information contained in an application.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>2.9 Account Reconciliation.</strong> Member will verify and reconcile any out-of-balance condition, and promptly notify the Credit Union of any errors within the time periods established in the Help File (exclusive of weekends and applicable holidays) after receipt of the applicable detail report from the Credit Union.

Upon request, Member agrees to provide copies of imaged documents (or original documents, if available) to facilitate investigations related to unusual transactions or poor quality transmissions, or to resolve disputes.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>3. Credit Union's Obligations.</strong><br>

The Credit Union shall exercise due care in seeking both to preserve the confidentiality of the user number, password, test key, or other code or identifier and to prevent the use of the service by unauthorized persons (and in this connection it is understood and agreed that implementation by the Credit Union of its normal procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of information relating to its members, and where practicable the obtaining by the Credit Union from any third parties engaged in the installation, maintenance and operation of the system of similar undertakings, shall constitute fulfillment of its obligation so to exercise due care) but shall not otherwise be under any liability or have any responsibility of any kind for any loss incurred or damage suffered by Member by reason or in consequence of any unauthorized person gaining access to or otherwise making use of the service. Member assumes full responsibility for the consequences of any misuse or unauthorized use of or access to the service or disclosure of any confidential information or instructions of Member by Member's employees, agents, or other third parties.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>3.2 Service Availability. </strong>Member understands that service availability is at all times conditioned upon the corresponding operation and availability of those computer services and systems used in communicating Member's instructions and requests to the Credit Union and the Credit Union's response.

Member agrees that if it wishes to attempt to deposit any Exception Item to any of Member's account with Credit Union, Member shall only do so by depositing the original item on which the Exception Item is based. Member acknowledges and agrees that even if Credit Union does not initially identify an electronic image as an Exception Item, the substitute check created by the Credit Union there from may nevertheless be returned to Credit Union because, among other reasons, the electronic image is deemed illegible by a paying bank. Credit Union's failure to identify an Exception Item shall not preclude or limit the obligation of Member to Credit Union.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>3.4 Transaction History. </strong>Credit Union shall provide Member with transaction history via the Internet and the Online Banking service detailing items processed, return items, and deposit adjustments.</span></span><br>

THE CREDIT UNION'S LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY LIABILITY TO MEMBER IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>6.2 Member's Duty to Report Errors. </strong>Member shall notify Credit Union of any errors, omissions, or interruptions in, or delay or unavailability of, the Services as promptly as practicable, and in any event within one business day after the earliest of discovery thereof, or the date discovery should have occurred through the exercise of reasonable care, and, in the case of any error, within fourteen (14) days of the date of the earliest notice to Member which reflects the error. Failure of Member to notify Credit Union of any error, omission, or other discrepancy within seven (7) days from the date of a loss shall relieve Credit Union of any liability for such error, omission, or discrepancy.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>6.3 Credit Union's Performance.</strong> Member acknowledges and agrees that Credit Union shall not be liable for any damages or loss of any kind resulting from any unintentional error or omission by Credit Union in performing the Services, in accordance with or unintentional deviation from the terms and conditions of this agreement, including exhibits or addenda.

&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">i. Credit Union receives actual notice or has reason to believe that Member has filed or commenced a petition or proceeding for relief under any bankruptcy or similar law;<br>
ii. The ownership of funds involving an Entry or the Authorized Representative's authority to transmit an Entry is in question;<br>
iii. Credit Union suspects a breach of the Security procedures;<br>
iv. Credit Union suspects that the account has been used for illegal or fraudulent purposes; or<br>
v. Credit Union reasonably believes that an Entry is prohibited by federal law or regulation, or otherwise so provided in the Agreement.<br>

If Credit Union fails to perform under this Agreement in accordance with the standards set herein, Credit Union's liability for damages, losses, and other compensation owing to Member shall be limited to the total fees paid by Member to Credit Union for the Credit Union failure to perform resulting in such liability in the two (2) month period preceding the date the claim accrued. Credit Union shall not be liable for any loss, damage, liability, or claim arising directly or indirectly from any error, delay, or failure to perform hereunder which is caused by earthquakes, fires, natural disasters, civil or foreign disturbances, power outages, acts of government, labor disputes, failures in either communication or computer networks, legal constraints, or any other event beyond its control. In no event will Credit Union be liable for any indirect, consequential, punitive, or special damages.

The Credit Union may immediately suspend or terminate Member's access to the service in the event that the Credit Union reasonably determines such suspension or termination is necessary in order to protect the service or the Credit Union from harm or compromise of integrity, security, reputation, or operation.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>9.

&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>12. Enforcement.</strong> Member agrees to be liable to the Credit Union for any liability, loss, or expense as provided in this Agreement that the Credit Union incurs as a result of any dispute involving Member accounts or services. Member authorizes the Credit Union to deduct any such liability, loss, or expense from Member account without prior notice to Member. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Michigan as applied to contracts entered into solely between residents of, and to be performed entirely in, such state.

Should any one or more provisions of this Agreement be determined illegal or unenforceable in any relevant jurisdiction, then such provision may be modified by the proper court, if possible, but only to the extent necessary to make the provision enforceable and such modification shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>13. Financial Information.</strong> Credit Union may from time to time request information from Member in order to evaluate a continuation of service to be provided by Credit Union under this agreement. Member agrees to provide the requested financial information immediately upon request by the Credit Union, in the form required by the Credit Union. Member authorizes the Credit Union to investigate or reinvestigate at any time any information provided by the Member in connection with this agreement or service and to request reports from credit bureaus and reporting agencies for such purpose. Upon request by the Credit Union, Member hereby authorizes the Credit Union, if Member is a business entity with premises open to the public, to enter Member's business premises for the purpose of ensuring that Member is in compliance with this agreement. If Member refuses to provide the requested financial information, or if the Credit Union concludes, in its sole discretion, that the credit risk of Member is unacceptable, or if Member refuses to give the Credit Union access to Member's premises, the Credit Union may terminate service according to the provisions hereof.<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Michigan State University Federal Credit Union makes available to members various electronic fund transfer services, made possible by our advanced electronic data processing system. Some of these transfers are made by use of ATM, credit, or debit cards that we issue. Other transfers are made by use of a telephone through the MoneyLine program; a check converted into an electronic debit; through ComputerLine—our online banking by use of a personal computer; or through Green on the Go® mobile banking or the MSUFCU Mobile app by use of an internet-enabled mobile device.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If we also provide a personal identification number (called a “PIN”) to a member, ATM cards can be used, together with the PIN, in various automated teller machine networks to make electronic fund transfers to, from, or between one or more of your accounts at MSUFCU. We issue different plastic cards that can be used in this manner, including Visa Debit Cards and Visa Credit Cards. In this disclosure, we call the cards simply “ATM cards” because they can be used in automated teller machines, and we sometimes refer to these different automated teller machines as simply “ATMs.” Your card and PIN may also be used to make purchases of goods and services at participating merchant locations.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We will, upon request, issue you a MoneyLine Personal Access Code, which you can use with a touch-tone telephone to make electronic fund transfers to, from, or between one or more accounts at MSUFCU by following the rules and procedures of our MoneyLine program.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We will, upon request, issue you a ComputerLine password, which you can use with an internet connection to make electronic fund transfers to, from, or between one or more accounts at MSUFCU following the rules and procedures of our ComputerLine program. You may also use your ComputerLine password to make electronic fund transfers to, from, or between one or more accounts at MSUFCU following the rules and procedures of Green on the Go® mobile banking or the MSUFCU Mobile app.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You agree that you will keep your PINs, Personal Access Code, and</span></span> <span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">passwords secret.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This is a disclosure and a contract. That is, the terms and conditions set out here are binding on you and on us to the making of such electronic fund transfers and the use of the ATM cards, the PINs, and the passwords, in the following cases:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you use the account(s) covered by this disclosure after receipt of this agreement</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you already have an ATM card and PIN provided by us and you use them to make such transactions after receipt of this agreement</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you ask us to provide you with a PIN and you thereafter use it, together with an ATM card we have issued, to make such transactions</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If we issue a Personal Access Code at your request and you use it to make transactions through our MoneyLine program</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If we issue a password at your request and you use it to make transactions through ComputerLine, Green on the Go® mobile banking, or the MSUFCU Mobile app</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In all such cases, your use of the account(s) or your making of such transactions constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions set out in this disclosure.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Excluded Transactions:</strong> The terms and conditions of this disclosure only apply to those services and transfers which are electronic fund transfers as described in Section 4; they do not apply to other transactions which, although electronic in nature, do not constitute electronic fund transfers described in that section.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>6. Fees for Electronic Fund Transfers:</strong> There are certain fees and charges for electronic fund transfer services we offer which you agree to pay. For a current listing of all applicable fees and charges, see our current Fee Schedule, which is incorporated by reference into this disclosure and the receipt of which you hereby acknowledge.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When you use an ATM not owned by us, the ATM operator may charge you a fee for any network used, and you may be charged a fee for a balance inquiry even if you do not complete the fund transfer.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>7. Limitations on Electronic Fund Transfers: </strong>We describe the types of electronic fund transfers you can make through our various electronic fund transfer services in Section 4. With respect to certain accounts, there are limitations as to how many automatic transfers you are allowed to make to third parties (e.g., mortgage payments or insurance premiums). No more than six (6) such transfers may be made from these accounts during any single statement period. Please refer to your Truth-in-Savings Disclosure to determine if this account limitation applies. Aside from that limitation, and as to transactions other than those made at an ATM, there are, at the present time, no limitations as to how often you can make electronic fund transfers, nor is there any restriction as to the dollar amount of any one electronic fund transfer. We reserve the right to impose any such restrictions in the future as we deem reasonable. Please refer to Section 22 for limitations that apply to ATM and Point-of-Sale transactions.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">8. Documentation of Transfers:</span></span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You can receive a transaction receipt at the time you make any transfer to, from, or between your account(s) using an ATM.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you have arranged to have Direct Deposits (which are electronic fund transfers as described in Section 4) made to your asset account(s) at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, the person or company making the deposit will tell you every time they send us the money. You may visit any branch, call us at 517-333-2424 or 800-678-4968, or access your transaction history via ComputerLine, MoneyLine, Green on the Go® mobile banking, or the MSUFCU Mobile app to find out whether the deposit has been made.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You will get a statement every month if you have authorized any electronic fund transfer service described in Section 4. If no electronic fund transfer occurs in a particular calendar quarter, you will still receive a quarterly statement for that quarter. However, for an asset account to which you have authorized no electronic fund transfers other than preauthorized credits, you will get a statement quarterly. On any account considered dormant, a statement will be sent to you annually.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Periodic statements we send you on accounts which are subject to electronic fund transfers described in Section 4 and transaction receipts issued by an ATM are admissible evidence.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Your right to documentation as set forth above in this section does not apply when the electronic fund transfer occurs outside of the United States.</span></span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>9. Stopping Payment of Transfers From Your Account(s): </strong>The following rules apply only to electronic fund transfers as described in Section 4 of this disclosure.<br>
<br>
If you have arranged for regular automatic payments out of your account, you can stop any of these payments. Here’s how: call us at 800-678-4968 or 517-333-2424, visit any branch location, contact us online at www.msufcu.org, or write us:</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Michigan State University Federal Credit Union<br>
3777 West Road<br>
PO Box 1208<br>
East Lansing, MI 48826-1208<br>
<br>
in time for us to receive your request three (3) business days or more before the payment is scheduled to be made. If you call, you will be required to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days of your call.<br>
<br>
There is a charge for each stop payment order. We reserve the right to impose a reasonable charge, or to increase such charges, in the future. Please see our Fee Schedule to determine the current stop payment fee.<br>
<br>
If these regular payments vary in amount, the person you are going to pay will tell you 10 days before each payment when it will be made and how much it will be. You may choose instead to get this notice only when your payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set; if so, you must make the necessary arrangements with the person you are going to pay.<br>
<br>
If you order us to stop one of these payments three (3) business days or more before the transfer is scheduled and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages.<br>
<br>
In Section 17 of this disclosure, we will tell you what our business days are.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>11. In Case of Error or Questions about Your Electronic Fund Transfers as Described in Section 4:</strong> Contact us at the telephone number or address set forth in Section 9 as soon as you can if you think your statement (which will include ATM, MoneyLine, check conversions, ComputerLine, Green on the Go® mobile banking, and the MSUFCU Mobile app transactions) or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we send the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When contacting us:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Tell us your name and account number.</span></span></li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days. In Section 17 of this agreement, we list our business days.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We will tell you the results of our investigation within 10 business days (five (5) business days for a Visa Debit Card Point-of-Sale transaction and 20 business days if the transfer involves an account open less than 30 days) after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days (if you give notice of an error within 30 days of opening an account; notice of an error involving a Point-of-Sale transaction; or notice of an error involving a transaction initiated outside of the United States, its possessions, and territories, we will have 90 days instead of 45) to investigate your complaint or questions. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within 10 business days (five (5) business days for a Visa Debit Card Point-of-Sale transaction and 20 business days if the transfer involves an account open less than 30 days) for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or questions in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not recredit your account.<br>
<br>
If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation within three (3) business days of finishing our investigation.<br>
<br>
You may ask us for copies of the documents that we use in our investigation, and we will furnish them to you. We may, in such cases, require payment of a nominal charge for such copies.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>12. Liability for Failure to Make Electronic Fund Transfer:</strong> If we do not complete an electronic fund transfer, as described in Section 4, to or from your account(s) on time or in the correct amount according to our agreements with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for the following:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money available in your account to make the transfer</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If there is not enough money in your account, in excess of amounts you have specifically pledged to us as collateral, to make the transfer</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If funds in your account are subject to garnishment/levy or other legal process which prevents making the transfer</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If we have, because of your default, exercised our rights against the funds in your account</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If the transfer would go over the credit limit on your overdraft line</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If the ATM where you are making the transaction does not have enough cash or is not functioning properly, and you were aware it was not functioning properly prior to initiating a transaction</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If, through no fault of ours, your ATM card is damaged</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you use or try to use your ATM card or your PIN after your right to use it has been canceled</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If circumstances beyond our control prevent the transfer, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We will also be excused from such liability if you fail to observe the terms and conditions of this agreement, our MoneyLine program, ComputerLine online banking, Green on the Go® mobile banking, the MSUFCU Mobile app, or our account agreements with you, as they relate to electronic fund transfers.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>13. Liability for Accuracy of Data:</strong> We will not be responsible to you for any claims, damages, losses, or expenses arising out of the preparation or delivery of data input for electronic fund transfers and credit or debit entries prepared by your employer or other person or company authorized to do so. In all cases, we will be entitled to rely upon the accuracy and correctness of this data input prepared by your employer or other authorized person or company, and we will have no obligation to investigate or determine the</span></span><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> accuracy or authorization of this data input or the electronic fund transfers directed by your employer or other person or company authorized by you to do so.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>14 . Consumer Liability for Unauthorized Use:</strong> If you furnish another person with your ATM card and PIN, MoneyLine Personal Access Code, checkbook, a check, or ComputerLine password (collectively, “access device”), you will be responsible for all electronic fund transfers initiated by the person. Your responsibility pertains to transfers from which you may receive no benefit, and applies even though that person may not have actual authority to initiate a transfer or transfers of an amount in excess of that which is authorized. Your responsibility for such transfers remains until you have notified us in writing that the person is no longer authorized to initiate transfers. Until you have notified us in writing, you will be liable for all transfers initiated by that person.<br>
<br>
Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your access device has been lost or stolen. Contacting us immediately by phone, email, or at any branch location may help to minimize your potential loss. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum overdraft line-of-credit). If you tell us within two (2) business days, you can lose no more than $50.00 if someone used your card without your permission.<br>
<br>
If you do not tell us within two (2) business days of learning of the loss or theft of your access device, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your access device without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.00.<br>
<br>
Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days of the statement being mailed, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.<br>
<br>
If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.<br>
<br>
If you believe your access device has been lost or stolen or that someone has transferred money from your account without your permission, or may be about to do so, contact us at the telephone number, website, or address as provided in Section 9 IMMEDIATELY.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>15. Special Unauthorized Use Liability Rule for Visa Debit Card: </strong>Unless you have been grossly negligent or have engaged in fraud, you will not be liable for any unauthorized transactions using your lost or stolen Visa Debit Card. This additional limit on liability does not apply to ATM transactions, to transactions using your PIN which are not processed by Visa, or to commercial cards.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>16. Reversing Electronic Fund Transfers:</strong> If an electronic fund transfer described in Section 4 was a payment of $50.00 or more for goods or services, you have the right to require us to reverse such transfer and to recredit your account with the full amount of the transfer if: (1) you tell us within four (4) calendar days of the date of the transfer to make such reversal, (2) you notify us that you have made a good faith attempt to resolve your dispute with the third party involved, and (3) you assure us that any returnable goods involved in the dispute will be returned.<br>
<br>
If you do these things in writing, you MUST send us a letter or call us at the address or phone number set forth in Section 9.<br>
<br>
If you tell us orally that you want such a transfer reversed, you must send us a letter to confirm your reversal request, your notice of attempted resolution of the dispute, and your assurance to return any returnable goods involved. We must receive this letter within 14 calendar days of the date of your oral request for reversal. We reserve the right to impose a reasonable charge for handling such reversal requests.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>17. Business Days:</strong> Business days for our offices are as follows: Monday through Friday, excluding posted holidays. We reserve the right to change our business days and hours at any of our branch facilities.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>18. Regulatory Agency:</strong> If you believe that we may have violated the Michigan law regulating electronic fund transfers (Michigan Public Act No. 322 of 1978) you may contact:</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Michigan Department of Consumer and Industry Services<br>
Office of Financial and Insurance Services<br>
PO Box 30224<br>
Lansing, MI 48909</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>19. Location of ATMs:</strong> The number and locations of the ATMs we own or operate is subject to change at any time. Locate CO-OP ATMs by visiting our website at www.msufcu.org, via Green on the Go® mobile banking, or the MSUFCU Mobile app.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>20. Card Ownership:</strong> All ATM cards, PINs, and passwords we provide are the property of MSUFCU. MSUFCU may, without liability or notice, revoke, cancel, or limit any or all use of the card privileges afforded in this agreement for good cause, and you will surrender the card to MSUFCU immediately upon demand. If this agreement is terminated, you agree to surrender the card to us. The primary member is responsible for all ATM cards issued to the member or any joint owners. If joint owners are removed from the account, it is the responsibility of the primary member to recover and surrender all ATM cards. Any transaction performed by a joint owner after the joint owner has been removed from the account shall be considered an authorized transaction for which the primary member is responsible, until the primary member has notified MSUFCU in writing that the joint owner is not authorized to perform transactions or the ATM card(s) has been surrendered to MSUFCU.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>21. Secrecy of PIN:</strong> If we have issued a PIN or password to you, or if you have selected your own MoneyLine Personal Access Code or ComputerLine password, you agree to keep your PIN and password secret and you also agree that you will not write the PIN on your ATM card nor any item you keep with your card.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>22. Limitations of Electronic Fund Transfer:</strong> There is no limitation on the number or dollar amount of deposits, payment transactions, or transfers between accounts you may make at an automated teller machine during its 24-hour operating cycle. To protect against possible losses, however, there are limitations on how much cash you can obtain from the machines during a single cycle or purchases made via Point-of-Sale transactions.<br>
<br>
Regardless of the number of cards we may issue to you, the following daily cash and purchase limits apply to use of an ATM card or Visa Debit Card:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The amount of cash that may be obtained by using your ATM card at an ATM is limited to $500.00 per day ($200.00 limit when the machine is offline).</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The amount of cash and purchases that may be obtained by using your ATM card at a POS terminal is limited to $1,000.00 when your account has been open for less than six months, and $2,500.00 when your account has been open for more than six months ($200.00 limit when the machine is offline).</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">All limitations in this section are subject to the verified balance in the account(s).</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In cases where an ATM card has been authorized for obtaining cash advances from ATMs or on a loan account, the maximums mentioned above include such cash advances.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There is a minimum $50.00 on Visa cash advance transactions performed at ATMs.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We reserve the right to change these limitations on use of the machines at any time.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>23. Responsibility for Overdraft:</strong> If you obtain cash from an ATM, which creates an overdraft in your savings account, the overdraft amount is due and payable the moment you get it and you agree to pay the full amount of it to us. You also authorize us, in such a case, to apply from any other shares you may have at MSUFCU such amount as may be necessary to pay such overdraft amount. If the overdraft is created in your checking account, (1) a transfer will be made from your other share account(s) to cover the overdraft, in accordance with your checking account agreement with us, (2) an advance on your line-of-credit loan account with us will be made to cover the overdraft and you will repay that advance in accordance with the terms and conditions of your line-of-credit plan, or (3) if you do not have a line-of-credit with us but qualify for our overdraft Courtesy Pay program, we may cover the overdraft and assess a fee as disclosed in our Fee Schedule. If there are not sufficient funds to make a transfer according to (1) or (2) of this sentence, or if you do not qualify for overdraft Courtesy Pay, then such overdraft will be paid to us as provided in the first sentence of this section.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>24. Crediting of Deposits and Payments:</strong> Deposits or payments made in an ATM, whether in cash, check, or money order, are subject to verification and the posting of such deposits and payments to savings, checking, or loan accounts may be delayed until they can be collected from the machine, verified, and entered into our accounting system. Further delay may occur if the transaction is made on or immediately prior to a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday on which we are closed. If you place a check or money order in the machine as a deposit or payment, it is subject to collection in accordance with your account agreement with us and our Funds Availability Policy as was disclosed to you upon opening your account and as may have since been amended.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>25. International Transactions: </strong>When you use your Visa Debit Card, Visa Credit Card, or ATM card for international transactions, a fee will be assessed. You agree to pay a 1.00% International Transaction Fee for ATM and Point-of-Sale (i.e., PIN-based) transactions and a 3.00% International Transaction Fee for all other international transactions and cash advances. The fee will be assessed on international transactions if a currency conversion does take place or if the transaction is processed in U.S. dollars.<br>
<br>
When you use your Visa Debit Card, Visa Credit Card, or ATM card at a merchant that settles in, or at an ATM that dispenses, currency other than U.S. dollars, the charge will be converted into the U.S. dollar amount. The currency conversion rate used to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars is either a wholesale market rate or the government-mandated rate in effect the day before the processing date. The conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date or posting date. The International Transaction Fee will be calculated after the transaction has been converted to U.S. dollars.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>26. Advisory Against Illegal Use:</strong> You agree not to use your card(s) for illegal gambling or other illegal purposes. Display of a payment card logo by, for example, an online merchant does not necessarily mean that transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which the cardholder may be located.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>27. Governing Law:</strong> This Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement and Disclosure is governed by the Bylaws of Michigan State University Federal Credit Union, federal laws and regulations, state laws and regulations, and local clearing house rules, as may be amended from time to time. Any disputes regarding this agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the appropriate court in Ingham County or the Federal District Court for the Western District of Michigan.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>28. Enforcement</strong>: You agree that you will be liable to us for any loss, cost, or other expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, we incur as a result of your failure to comply with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and as we may amend from time to time. You authorize us to deduct any loss, cost, or other expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, for any action we may take to enforce this Agreement from any account you hold at Michigan State University Federal Credit Union.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>29. Amendments Termination:</strong> We reserve the right to amend this disclosure (Agreement) in any manner and at any time. If we do so, we will give you such notice thereof as we deem to be reasonable under the circumstances; however, in specific cases when required by law we will give you at least 21 days advance written notice. We also reserve the right to terminate this disclosure (Agreement) by sending a notice of such termination by first-class mail to your last known address on our records, which notice shall be effective when mailed.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>30. Termination of Prior Agreements:</strong> This disclosure terminates and takes the place of any disclosure or agreement related to Electronic Fund Transfer laws we have previously furnished to you 21 days after we mail it to you.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>31. Effective Date:</strong> Except as provided in Section 30, the effective date of this disclosure (Agreement) is 07/01/2014.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Dividends paid on the Insured Money Management Account (IMMA)&nbsp;will be calculated on the daily balance in the account and will be paid at the end of each month. The dividend rate will be declared each business day based on investments made by MSUFCU&nbsp;on a day-to-day basis under guidelines established by an investment committee and approved by the board of directors. The minimum balance in the account is $2,000. Dividends will not be earned for any day in which the minimum balance of $2,000 is not maintained. Additional deposits, other than dividends, can be made at any time.<br>
<br>
MSUFCU, on request, will provide checks to be used for withdrawals from the account. The credit union is authorized to pay checks signed by IMMA account holders and to charge all such checks against funds in this account. It is further understood that&nbsp;MSUFCU is under no obligation to pay a check that exceeds the balance in this account and that only checks or other withdrawal methods approved by the credit union may be used to make withdrawals from the account.<br>
<br>
The credit union may pay a check on any day it is presented for payment and checks, when paid, become the property of&nbsp;MSUFCU and will not be returned with your account statements. Copies may be obtained of any paid check for a fee.<br>
<br>
Except for negligence, the credit union is not liable for any action it takes regarding payment or non-payment of a check. Checks must be written for no less than $500.<br>
<br>
Any check that cannot be paid due to insufficient funds in the Insured Money Management Account will be returned to the payee and an insufficient fund fee applicable at the time of presentation will be assessed. This fee applies to each check presented for payment when funds are not available.<br>
<br>
The credit union will accept written or ComputerLine stop payment orders on individual checks or a series of checks. The written stop payment order will remain in effect for a period of up to six (6) months or until canceled. A stop payment will be placed immediately upon receipt of the request, but the credit union will not be responsible for checks paid prior to or within the 24 hour period immediately following the stop payment request. For each stop payment request, a stop payment fee will be assessed.<br>
<br>
Each individual&nbsp;IMMA&nbsp;is limited to a total of six (6) electronic and phone withdrawals per calendar month. These withdrawals include:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Transfers within ComputerLine and Green on the Go<sup>®</sup> mobile banking, including scheduled share to share transfers</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Transfers made by phone, including those using MoneyLine and those made by a phone representative of MSUFCU</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Preauthorized electronic withdrawals to other institutions and merchants</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Automatic transfers to any account held at MSUFCU</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Overdraft transfers</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Written checks from an IMMA&nbsp;(a minimum of $500 each)</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The number of these types of withdrawals made per month reduces the number of permitted telephone or electronic transfers for the duration of the month. For example, if two checks clear your IMMA in one month, then only four telephone or&nbsp;ComputerLine transfers&nbsp;may be&nbsp;made that same month.<br>
<br>
There is no limit on the number of IMMA withdrawals initiated at an ATM, made in person, or received by mail.<br>
<br>
Periodic statements will be provided to depositors monthly or at the credit union's convenience. Any objection to an item or items appearing on a periodic statement will not be considered valid unless made in writing to the credit union within 60 days of the date the statement is mailed.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
MSUFCU is authorized to recognize the primary and all joint members on an account as owners of the IMMA, and all account holders may access the IMMA for purposes of withdrawal or deposit. Joint IMMA account holders hereby agree with each other and with&nbsp;MSUFCU that all sums now paid on deposit or heretofore paid on deposit by any or all of the owners to their credit as joint owners with all accumulation of dividends therein, are and shall be owned by them jointly, with right of survivorship and be subject to withdrawal or receipt of any of them, and payment to any of them or the survivor shall be&nbsp;paid and discharge the credit union from any liability for such payment.<br>
<br>
Use of the Insured Money Management Account is subject to federal and state laws and regulations and other items, conditions, restrictions, and requirements as the credit union may establish from time-to-time. The agreement/disclosure governing the use of the Insured Money Management Account may be amended at any time as necessary by the credit union by posting a notice of amendment in a conspicuous place in the credit union's branch&nbsp;lobbies&nbsp;and on our website&nbsp;and will become effective immediately upon posting.<br>
<br>
MSUFCU reserves the right to refuse accounts and/or the use of the Insured Money Management Account at its discretion, and to terminate the deposit relationship at any time and without notice.<br>
<br>
The credit union also reserves the right to require at least a seven (7) day notice of withdrawal.<br>
<br>
IMMA accounts have multiple tiers. The larger the deposit in the account, the higher the rate.<br>
$2,000-$9,999.99<br>
$10,000-$49,999.99<br>
$50,000-$99,999.99<br>

	<p><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Annual Percentage Yield is the total amount of dividends paid on an account, based on the dividend rate and the frequency of monthly compounding for a 365-day period, and expressed as a percentage. This rate assumes that a set amount is on deposit at the beginning of the dividend period, that no deposits or withdrawals are made during the dividend period, and funds remain on deposit for one full year at the same dividend rate.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The dividend rate and APY on your account are listed on the Current Dividends sheet. The dividends are valid through the date on the Current Dividends sheet. The dividend rate and APY will be declared and can change weekly by management based on the guidelines approved by MSUFCU's board of directors.</span></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Balance Computation Method</span></strong></span><br>
Dividends are calculated by the daily balance method which applies a daily periodic rate to the balance in the account each date. Dividends will begin to accrue on the business day you deposit funds, including non-cash items (e.g., checks) to your account.</p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>Compounding and Crediting</strong><br>
Dividends will be compounded and credited to your account monthly. For this account, the dividend is paid monthly; for example, the beginning date of the first dividend period of the calendar year is January 1, 2010, and the ending date of such dividend period is January 31, 2010. All other dividend periods follow the same pattern of dates. The dividend declaration date is the ending date of the dividend period, and for the example is January 31, 2010.</span></p>

You have elected that upon maturity of this certificate the balance will automatically renew at the rate current at that time for the same certificate term. You will have a grace period of seven days after renewal to withdraw the funds without being charged a penalty. Dividends will not be paid on the amount withdrawn during the seven-day grace period.</span></span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>Early Withdrawal Penalty</strong><br>
A substantial penalty is imposed if any funds, other than the last dividends paid, are withdrawn from the certificate prior to the maturity date. If the dividend is not sufficient to cover the penalty the principal amount will be reduced to cover this amount. The penalties are as follows:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px">A. Certificates of one year or less - A penalty equal to 90-days dividends based on the amount withdrawn.</span></span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px">B. Certificates of more than one year - A penalty equal to 180-days dividends based on the amount withdrawn.</span></span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px">C. If an early withdrawal reduces the certificate below the required minimum balance, the certificate will be canceled and a penalty charged on the full balance using the appropriate above method.</span></span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px">The above penalties do not apply if your withdrawal is made as part of an established automatic distribution plan, as an IRS required withdrawal after age 70 1/2, or if you die, or become disabled. Additional IRS penalties may apply. Additional rules apply for Health Savings Accounts.</span></span></span></p>
</div>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>Health Savings Account Exception</strong><br>
Certificates set up within Health Savings Accounts follow the same guidelines as listed above, with the following exception: one withdrawal from an existing Certificate will be permitted before the maturity date without MSUFCU penalty.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

Taxpayer Identification Numbers and Backup Withholding. </strong>If you cannot furnish your Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) to us, we may not permit you to open an account until you can provide us with it. Incorrect TINs may cause backup withholding.

Control of Multiple Party Accounts. </u>Any owner is allowed and deemed to have the authority to act on behalf of any other account owner(s) with respect to any and all account transactions. Each owner guarantees the signature of any other owner(s). Each owner appoints the other owner to be his/her irrevocable attorney. An owner does not need permission from the other owner(s) in order to withdraw funds, request stop payment on items, or authorize a transfer of all, or any part, of the savings. We are not obligated to inform any owner(s) about any transaction, except as required by law. We require signatures from all owners authorizing any material changes of the account. If we are informed, in writing, of a disagreement between account owners, or if there is a conflict in directions, between owners, on how to handle an account, we may place a hold on all funds in the account or close the account, or require a court order or written permission from all owners before taking any action with respect to the account.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><u>b. Multiple Party Account Liability.</u> If a deposited item in a multiple party account is returned due to insufficient funds, the account is overdrawn or a final payment is not made on a transaction, the owners, jointly and individually, are responsible for reimbursing us the amount of the returned item, overdraft, or unpaid item and any fees that may be assessed, no matter who approved or initiated the transaction. We may exercise our rights against any account of any owner and any funds in the multiple party account to obtain reimbursement from any account owner indebted to us, regardless of who contributed such funds to the account.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><u>c. Right of Survivorship.</u> When one owner of a multiple party account dies, all rights and available funds in the account fall to the remaining account owner(s), unless otherwise authorized in the Membership Agreement. If a surviving owner does not exist, the last deceased owner’s interest will go to his or her estate. If a surviving owner does exist, his or her share of the account is subject to any financial obligations, security interest, or pledge authorized by the decedent, even if the surviving owner did not agree to it.</span></span></p>

Any joint owner shall be jointly and individually liable to us for any returned item, overdraft or unpaid transaction on the minor’s account. Transactions may be handled and dividends paid without approval from the co-owner of legal age. A parent or guardian is not permitted to access the minor’s account unless he or she is the joint owner on the account.

The minor is the recipient of the custodial funds in the account. The custodian holds proprietary rights and control of the account for the sole privilege and advantage of the minor and until the minor reaches the age of majority. The custodian is the only party authorized to contribute or withdraw funds or close the account, unless otherwise ordered by the court. We are not required to question the use or purpose of any transaction. We may delay any withdrawals from the account if the custodian dies until we have been instructed by any person permitted by law to withdraw funds, or a court orders us to make a withdrawal.</span></span></p>

If more than one POD or beneficiary/payee is named, the ownership of account benefits passes to all such beneficiaries/payees, without rights of survivorship. Designation of a beneficiary/payee for IRAs<span> </span>and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) is separate from, and does not apply to, POD designations. We are not required to inform the beneficiary/payee of the establishment of any such account or his or her vesting interest in any account, unless required by law. If no person designated as a POD beneficiary/payee is living at the time of the death of the last surviving owner, the account shall be considered part of the owner’s estate.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>8. Accounts for Trusts and Other Entities.</strong> MSUFCU offers accounts for trusts and other entities such as estates, organizations, associations, sole proprietorships, corporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships that qualify for membership. These types of accounts are governed by separate account agreements specific to the type of entity and account. This Agreement does not apply to such accounts.</span></span></p>

Designation of an Account Agent. </strong>An instruction given to MSUFCU by an account owner that permits another person to transact business on specified accounts is a designation of an account agent. A designation does not give the agent any ownership rights in an account or voting privileges with MSUFCU. We are not required to question the use or purpose of any transaction the agent makes.</span></span></p>

Endorsements.</u> Transfers, checks, drafts, and other items may be received for deposit into any of your accounts if they are payable to, or to the order of, one or more account owner(s), even if all payees fail to endorse them. If we choose, we may furnish missing endorsements of any owner. If a check, draft, or item that is payable to two or more owners is unclear as to whether it is made out to either or both, we may process that check, draft or item as though it is payable to either person. When you deposit items into your account, you warrant that all prior endorsements are genuine. MSUFCU reserves the right to verify all endorsements on third-party checks presented for payment or deposit either in person or by comparison with Member Account Agreements. If an insurance check, a government check, or other check or draft specifies endorsement requirements on the back of the check or draft, we may require exact endorsement as stated on the item. We require that endorsements be made on the back of the share draft or check within one inch of the upper edge, but we may choose to receive items that have been endorsed outside of that space. However, you are liable for any loss we incur from any delay or processing error due to an incorrect endorsement or other marks made by you or any previous endorser. MSUFCU may disregard information on any check other than the signature of the drawer and amount of the item and any magnetic encoded information. You agree that MSUFCU does not fail to use ordinary care in paying an item solely because its procedures do not provide for sight examination of items.</span></span></p>

We are not accountable for any mishandling of an item by another party or its loss in transit. Each separate party will only be accountable for its own negligence. We reserve the right to send any item for collection. Items drawn on an institution not located in the United States are exclusively processed on a collection basis.

You must approve each direct deposit or automatic transfer beforehand by completing a form provided by us or the organization from which you receive the payment. A separate form must be completed for each direct deposit or automatic transfer. To cancel or modify a direct deposit or automatic transfer, you must notify the organization from which the payment is originated. If applicable, you must notify MSUFCU at least 30 days prior to any direct deposit or preapproved transfer if you wish to cancel or change the direct deposit or transfer. If you file for bankruptcy, all direct deposits that you have authorized will remain unchanged unless you cancel them. If it becomes mandatory that we reimburse the U.S. government for any payment made directly to your account, we may take the amount to be remunerated from any of your accounts, unless restricted by law.</span></span></p>

We may ascertain that an account lacks sufficient funds to cover an item any time we attempt to process the item. Only one review of the account balance is required during that time. We are not required to inform you if your checking account lacks sufficient funds to cover an item. Regardless of whether we pay the item or reject it, you agree to pay any fee we may assess to your account as stated in the Fee Schedule. Except as noted in a written agreement, we, by paying one or any overdraft, do not consent to honor overdrafts in the future and may cease paying overdrafts at any time, without notice. If we cover a check or charge a fee that would overdraw your account, you promise to repay the overdrawn amount to us immediately. We have the right to seek collection of earlier dishonored items not covered at any time, including granting a payer bank additional time past any deadline.</span></span></p>

You acknowledge that accurate information is required for MSUFCU’s computer system to distinguish the check. We are not liable for failing to stop payment on a check if you provide inaccurate or incomplete information to us.

Ordinary care shall also be measured by the standard of the reasonableness of policies and procedures established for the transaction involved, and mere clerical error, computer malfunction, inadvertence, or oversight without malice or an honest mistake of judgment shall not be or constitute as to any transactions, a failure to perform such obligations or a failure to exercise ordinary care, and in no case shall be deemed wrongful.</span></span></p>

If a deposit or withdrawal has not been posted to your account for 36 consecutive months, and we have not had any other contact with you, we will consider your account abandoned. We will report and disburse the funds from an abandoned account in accordance with Michigan law. Dormant accounts receive only an annual account statement.</span></span></p>

Important Information Regarding Your MSUFCU Checking.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="char-style-override-1">What is a substitute check? </span></strong>To make check processing faster, federal law permits banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks” or electronic checks. These checks are similar in size to original checks with a slightly reduced image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states: “This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check.” You may use a substitute check as proof of payment just like the original check.</span></span></p>

<p class="Body para-style-override-1"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">MSUFCU members do not receive their canceled checks. Those who use ComputerLine may view their canceled checks through our check imaging system. Because of the Check 21 Act, when online, you may view copies of substitute checks. You may copy this check as proof of payment should you need to. Occasionally you may request a copy of a check from us because it is necessary as proof of payment. This notice describes rights you have when you receive substitute checks from us. The rights in this notice do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits to your account. However, you have rights under other laws with respect to those transactions.</span></span></p>

<p class="Body para-style-override-1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Body para-style-override-1"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span class="char-style-override-1"><strong>What are my rights regarding substitute checks?</strong> </span>In certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you suffer if a substitute check is posted to your account (for example, if you think that we withdrew the wrong amount from your account or that we withdrew money from your account more than once for the same check). The losses you may attempt to recover under this procedure may include the amount that was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal (for example, bounced check fees).</span></span></p>

<p class="Body para-style-override-1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Body para-style-override-1"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The amount of your refund under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You also are entitled to interest on the amount of your refund if your account is an interest-bearing account. If your loss exceeds the amount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other law. If you use this procedure, you may receive up to $2,500.00 of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) within 10 business days of us receiving your claim and the remainder of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) not later than 45 calendar days after we receive your claim. We may reverse the refund (including any interest on the refund) if we are later able to demonstrate that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="char-style-override-1">How do I make a claim for a refund?</span></strong> If you believe that you have suffered a loss relating to a substitute check that you received and that was posted to your account, please contact us at MSUFCU; Specialty and Support Services; PO Box 1208; East Lansing, MI 48826-1208; by calling 517-333-2424 or toll-free 800-678-4968, or online at www.msufcu.org. You must contact us within 40 calendar days of the date that we mailed (or otherwise delivered by a means to which you agreed) the substitute check in question or the account statement showing that the substitute check was posted to your account, whichever is later. We will extend this time period if you were not able to make a timely claim because of extraordinary circumstances.<br>
Your claim must include the following:</span></span></p>

<p class="Body para-style-override-1">&nbsp;</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This Disclosure is provided in compliance with the Federal Expedited Funds Availability Act and Regulation CC. This policy applies to all deposits into personal checking accounts at the MSUFCU at 3777 West Road, East Lansing, Michigan, and at all of its branches.

<p class="Body para-style-override-1"><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day, except Saturday, Sunday, federal holidays, and MSUFCU posted holidays. If you make a deposit on a business day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit was made on the next business day.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Dormant Account Fee Change</strong><br>
Effective May 15, 2016, the Dormant Account Fee will be charged to all Dormant Accounts, not only accounts with balances of less than $500.00. Verbiage in Section 27 of the Membership &amp; Account Agreement has been updated to reflect this change.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Section 27 – Dormant Account</strong><br>
We will consider an account to be dormant if there are no deposits or withdrawals for a period of 18 months. Exceptions are loan accounts, Certificates, and IRAs/HSAs.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When an account becomes dormant, we will charge a monthly dormant account fee as stated in the Fee Schedule, unless restricted by law. The fee will be charged until the account becomes active or there are no funds available to pay the fee. You authorize us to transfer funds from other accounts of yours to cover any service fees we may impose upon the account deemed dormant. To the extent allowed by law, we reserve the right to transfer account funds to an account payable and suspend any further account statements. We will attempt to notify you prior to your account becoming dormant. If a deposit or withdrawal has not been posted to your account for 36 consecutive months, and we have not had any other contact with you, we will consider your account abandoned. We will report and disburse the funds from an abandoned account in accordance with Michigan law. Dormant accounts receive only an annual account statement.</span></span><br>

<span style="color:#004F39;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Funds Availability at MSUFCU</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION</strong><br>
This Disclosure is provided in compliance with the Federal Expedited Funds Availability Act and Regulation CC. This policy applies to all deposits into personal checking accounts at the MSUFCU at 3777 West Road, East Lansing, Michigan, and at all of its branches. MSUFCU reserves the right to delay the availability of funds deposited to accounts that are not checking accounts for periods longer than those disclosed in this agreement.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day, except Saturday, Sunday, federal holidays, and MSUFCU posted holidays. If you make a deposit on a business day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit was made on the next business day.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>HOLDS ON OTHER FUNDS (CHECK CASHING)</strong><br>
If we cash a check for you that is drawn on another financial institution, we may withhold the availability of a corresponding amount of funds that are already in your checking account. Those funds will be available at the time funds from the check we cashed would have been available if you had deposited it.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>HOLDS ON OTHER FUNDS (OTHER ACCOUNTS)</strong><br>
If we accept for deposit a check that is drawn on another financial institution, we may make funds from the deposit available for withdrawal immediately but delay your availability to withdraw a corresponding amount of funds that you have on deposit in another account with us. The funds in the other account would then not be available until the time period, described elsewhere in this disclosure for the type you deposited, lapsed.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>DELAYED AVAILABILITY</strong><br>
In some cases, we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by check available to you immediately. Depending on the type of check that you deposit, funds may not be available until the business day after the day of your deposit. However, the first $200.00 of your deposits will be available on the first business day after the day we receive your deposit. If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit available immediately, we will notify you at the time you make your deposit. We will also tell you when the funds will be available. If your deposit is not made directly to one of our employees, or if we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you the notice by the day after we receive your deposit.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>LONGER DELAYS MAY APPLY</strong><br>
In addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We believe a check you deposit will not be paid.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You deposit checks totaling more than $5,000.00 on any one day.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You have overdrawn your account repeatedly in the last six months.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There is an emergency, such as failure of communications or computer equipment.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be available. They will generally be available no later than the eleventh business day after the day of your deposit.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>SPECIAL RULES FOR NEW ACCOUNTS</strong><br>
The following special rules may apply during the first 30 days your checking account is open.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Funds from the deposits of cash and the first $5,000.00 of a day’s total deposits of cashier’s, certified, teller’s, travelers’, and state and local government checks will be available immediately if the deposit meets certain conditions. For example, the checks must be payable to you. The excess over $5,000.00 will be available no later than the ninth business day after the day of your deposit.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Funds from all other check deposits will be available no later than the ninth business day after the day of your deposit.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Please remember that even after we have made funds available to you, and you have withdrawn the funds, you are still responsible for checks you deposit that are returned to us unpaid and for any other problems involving your deposit. If you have any questions, please contact MSUFCU.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>SHARED BRANCHES</strong><br>
Shared branches are defined as those offices where members of many different credit unions are able to perform transactions on their own credit union account. Transactions performed at shared branch locations are subject to their fees, rules, policies, and procedures.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>LONGER DELAYS MAY APPLY</strong><br>
In some cases, all of the funds that you deposit by check will not be available to you on the same business day you make the deposit. Depending upon the type of check you deposit, funds may not be immediately available. However, the first $200.00 of your deposits will be available on the first business day after the day we receive your deposit. If all of your funds from your deposit are not available on the same business day, you will be notified at the time you make your deposit as to when your funds will be available. If your deposit is not made directly to a shared branch employee, or if this action is taken after you have left the premises, a notice will be mailed to you by the business day after your deposit is received. If you will need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available. In addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period if there is an emergency such as failure of communications or computer equipment. Should such an emergency occur, we will notify you and tell you when the funds will be available. They will generally be available no later than the seventh business day after the day of your deposit.</span></span></p>				<br>

		<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>ELECTRONIC RECORD AND SIGNATURE DISCLOSURE </strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">From time to time, Michigan State University Federal Credit Union (we, us or Company) may be required by law to provide to you certain written notices or disclosures. Described below are the terms and conditions for providing to you such notices and disclosures electronically through your DocuSign, Inc. (DocuSign) Express user account. Please read the information below carefully and thoroughly, and if you can access this information electronically to your satisfaction and agree to these terms and conditions, please confirm your agreement by clicking the 'I agree' button at the bottom of this document.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Getting paper copies </strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">At any time, you may request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available electronically to you by us. You will have the ability to download and print documents we send to you through the DocuSign system during and immediately after signing session and, if you elect to create a DocuSign signer account, you may access them for a limited period of time</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">(usually 30 days) after such documents are first sent to you. After such time, you will need to contact us if you wish to request paper copies of any such signed documents from our office to you. You may request delivery of such paper copies from us by following the procedure described below.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Withdrawing Consent for Electronic Disclosures </strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you decide to receive notices and disclosures from us electronically, you may change your mind at any time and tell us that thereafter you want to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format. To indicate us of your decision to receive future notices and disclosures in paper format and withdraw your consent to receive notices and disclosures in electronic format, you will need to complete the DocuSign a€IBWithdraw Consenta€? form on the signing page of a DocuSign envelope instead of signing the document. After completing this step, your consent to receive electronic disclosures will be withdrawn and you will no longer use the DocuSign system for electronic notices, disclosures, or signatures.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Paper Disclosures vs. Electronic Disclosures </strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Receiving important notices and disclosures in electronic format, rather than paper, has several benefits: faster processing times and easier storage. If you consent to using only paper format for notices, disclosures, and signatures, we will first need to send the paper notices and disclosures to you and wait for you to return your acknowledgement or receipt of said notices and disclosures. This can extend the processing time required to complete your transactions and requests. Alternatively, electronic disclosures can be sent to and from you immediately, offering you more efficiency and convenience. Electronic disclosures can also be stored electronically, freeing space for areas where you typically stored paper documents.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>All notices and disclosures will be sent to you electronically </strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Unless you tell us otherwise in accordance with the procedures described herein, we will provide electronically to you through your DocuSign user account all required notices, disclosures, authorizations, acknowledgements, and other documents that are required to be provided or made available to you during the course of our relationship with you. To reduce the chance of you inadvertently not receiving any notice or disclosure, we prefer to provide all of the required notices and disclosures to you by the same method and to the same address that you have given us. Thus, you can receive all the disclosures and notices electronically or in paper format through the paper mail delivery system. If you do not agree with this process, please let us know as described below. Please also see the paragraph immediately above that describes the consequences of your electing not to receive delivery of the notices and disclosures electronically from us.</span></span></p>
