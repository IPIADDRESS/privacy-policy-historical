  <p>Other Microsoft services linked to from this Web site, <a href="http://www.passport.com/">Microsoft
  Passport</a> and <a href="http://microsoft.com/canada/">Microsoft.com/canada</a> have their own statements of privacy which can be viewed by clicking on the links.</p>
  <p><b>Collection of your Personal Information</b></p>
  <p>At some sites, MSN collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work
  address or telephone number. At other sites, MSN collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender,
  preferences, interests and favorites. Some sites collect a combination of the
  two types of information. Information collected at one MSN Web site may be
  shared within Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates, including the MSN
  family of Web sites. Personal and demographic data may be stored and processed outside of your 
  country, including transfers to the United States, and by using MSN, you consent to any such transfers outside of your country.</p>
  <p>There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by
  MSN and may be shared with other Web sites within the Microsoft family of web
  sites. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain
  names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is
  used by MSN for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the
  service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the MSN Web
  sites.</p>
  <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose
  personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through MSN
  Chats, MSN Communities, or other public online forums, this information may
  be collected and used by others. Note: MSN does not read any of your private
  online communications such as your MSN Messenger messages or Hotmail e-mails.</p>
      <p>MSN encourages you to 
      review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from MSN 
      so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your 
      information. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy statements or 
      other content on Web sites outside of the Microsoft and MSN family of Web 
      sites.</p>
  <p><b>Use of your Personal Information</b></p>
  <p>MSN Web sites and their operational service partners collect and use your
  personal information to operate MSN Web sites and deliver the services you
  have requested. MSN sites also use your personally identifiable information
  to inform you of other products or services available from Microsoft and its
  affiliates. MSN may also contact
  you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or
  of potential new services that may be offered.</p>
  <p>MSN does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. 
  MSN may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners 
  about a particular offering that may be of 
  interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable 
  information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred 
  to the third party. In addition, MSN may share data with trusted
  partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or
  postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your
  personal information except to provide these services to Microsoft, and they
  are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>
  <p>MSN does not use or disclose sensitive personal 
      information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without 
      your explicit consent.</p>
  <p>MSN keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers
  visit within MSN, in order to determine what MSN sites and services are the
  most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising
  within MSN to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in
  a particular subject area.</p>
  <p>MSN Web sites will disclose your personal information,
  without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief
  that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or
  comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect and
  defend the rights or property of Microsoft, MSN and its family of Web
  sites; and, (c)
  act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of
  Microsoft, its web sites, or the public.</p>
  <p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
  <p>Many of the MSN Web sites use "cookies" to help
  you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is
  placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
  programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned
  to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
  cookie to you.</p>
  <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a
  convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the
  Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
  personalize MSN's pages, or register with MSN sites or services, a cookie
  helps MSN to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This
  simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as
  billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same
  MSN Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so
  you can easily use the MSN features that you customized.</p>
  <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most
  Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
  browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
  cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of
  the MSN services or Web sites you visit.</p>
  <p><b>Use of Web Beacons</b></p>
  <p>MSN Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web
  beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow MSN to count users
  who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons
  are not used to access your personally identifiable information on the MSN
  network of sites and services; they are a technique we use to compile
  aggregated statistics about MSN Web site usage.</p>
  <p>Web beacons collect only a limited set of information
  including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of
  the page on which the Web beacon resides. MSN Web pages may also contain Web
  beacons placed there by our advertising partners, as described below,
  to help MSN determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.</p>
  <p><b>Use of Third Party Ad Networks</b></p>
  <p>The majority of the online banner advertisements you see
  on MSN Web sites are displayed by MSN.</p>
  <p>In addition, MSN also allows other companies, called
  third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on MSN Web
  sites. To do this, ad networks place a persistent cookie on your computer.
  Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they
  send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information
  about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their
  advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information
  allows an ad network to deliver advertisements that they believe will be of
  most interest to you. Microsoft does not have access to or control of the
  cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.</p>
  <p>MSN maintains relationships with a number of the
  third-party ad networks currently operating such as: 24/7 Media; AdForce;
  AdKnowledge; AppNet/admaximize/i33; Avenue A; BlueStreak.com; CFM&amp;Z;
  Click Here; DoubleClick; Flycast; Interad Network; MatchLogic; Mediaplex;
  Sabela Media; The Thinking Media; and Vita Bella.</p>
  <p>If you want to prevent one of these third-party companies
  from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you will need to visit
  each ad network's Web site individually and request that you be removed from
  its system.</p>
  <p><b>Control your Personal Information</b></p>
  <p>MSN offers its customers choices for the collection, use
  and sharing of personal information. You may go to the 
  <a href="http://privacy.msn.ca/choice/default.asp">MSN Communications
  Preferences</a> page to proactively make choices about the 
  use and sharing of your personal information. You may choose not to 
  receive unsolicited marketing material from MSN Web sites and services or 
  unsolicited marketing material on behalf of external third party business 
  partners</p>
  <p>You will be asked to make your requests while logged into a Microsoft Passport
  account, so that MSN can associate your preferences with a particular
  account. This security safeguard prevents someone else from making choices
  about the usage and control of your personal information. If you do not have
  a Microsoft Passport account, you can create one now by clicking 
  <a href="http://www.passport.com/">here</a>.</p>
  <p>You may also stop the delivery of future promotional
  e-mail from MSN Web sites by following the specific instructions in the
  e-mail you receive. The instructions explain how to stop receiving such
  e-mails.</p>
  <p>There are some Web sites,
  including MSN Hotmail, which send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service
  issues, product surveys, new feature announcements and news about MSN
  products and services. These e-mails are considered essential to the
  provision of the service you have requested. You will not be able to choose
  to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered a part of the
  service you have chosen.</p>
  <p><b>Security of your Personal Information</b></p>
  <p>MSN secures your personal information from 
  unauthorized access, use or disclosure. MSN secures the personally 
  identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, 
  secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. 
  When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to 
  other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as 
  the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
  <p><b>Changes to this Statement</b></p>
  <p>MSN will occasionally
  update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. 
  MSN encourages you to periodically review this Statement
  to be informed of how Microsoft is protecting your information.</p>
  <p><b>Contact Information</b></p>
  <p>Microsoft welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of
  Privacy. If you believe that Microsoft has not adhered to this Statement, please
  contact Microsoft by e-mail. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the 
  problem.</p>

  <p><b>MSN Explorer</b><a name="MSNEXP"></a></p>
  <p><b>What personal information is collected:</b>
  When you sign up for MSN Explorer, we request registration
  information including personally identifiable information such as your name
  and address, as well as non-personally identifiable information including
  your occupation and other demographic information. Once registered, MSN will
  recognize you on your future visits to MSN Explorer. Through MSN Explorer
  registration, you have also created a Microsoft Passport account. For more
  information about Passport and the Passport services, go to 
  <a href="http://www.passport.com/">www.passport.com</a>.</p>
  <p>MSN Explorer gathers anonymous information, such as how
  many times a user attempts to log on, the average time for rendering the home
  page, or the length of time of your session online, while performing a
  continuous service quality monitoring function. MSN performs this service to
  help improve the technical quality of the service. The anonymous information
  does not contain any personally identifiable information.</p>
  <p>MSN Explorer collects and stores your favorite Web page
  addresses (URLs) in your Favorites list on a secure MSN server. This allows
  you to have your Favorites available from whichever computer you use to
  access MSN Explorer, even if you use multiple computers. It synchronizes the
  list you are using with the list on the server so that you can add or delete
  Favorites from any computer running MSN Explorer, anywhere in the world. The
  sole purpose of storing the information on the server is to provide you with
  the convenience of having your Favorites available to you anywhere you use
  MSN Explorer. Your Favorites are not used by MSN for any purpose other than
  to provide you access to them.</p>
  <p>Periodically, you may see a message informing you of a
  critical performance error in MSN Explorer. This message will ask you to send
  data to MSN. If you agree, MSN Explorer will automatically send and collect
  data needed to help MSN determine what caused the error. You may choose
  whether you want to send your data to help MSN learn why the error occurred.
  Before you choose to send your data to MSN, you will have an opportunity to
  review that data. If you choose to send the data, in certain instances, your
  personally identifiable information may also be sent to MSN. This personally
  identifiable information will be deleted prior to the review of the error
  data you send.</p>
  <p><b>How MSN uses your information: </b> MSN uses your registration
  information to authenticate you every time you sign in to MSN Explorer. MSN
  uses anonymous data gathered during service quality monitoring to improve the
  technical quality of the MSN Explorer service.</p>
  <p>MSN Explorer will not disclose your Favorites list to
  other MSN sites or share this list with any third parties, except when
  required to do so by law as described above in the MSN Privacy Statement. MSN
  does not use your Favorites list to create profiles. Nor will you receive
  marketing materials as a result of storing your Favorites on MSN servers.
  When you delete an item from your Favorite it is deleted from MSN servers
  when you sign out of MSN Explorer.</p>
  <p>MSN uses data gathered in error reporting to learn how to
  prevent future critical performance errors.</p>
  <p><b>Who else may receive my personal information:</b>
  All information you share with MSN Explorer is governed by the
  MSN Privacy Statement, except as noted above.</p>
  <p><b>How do I control my personal information:</b>
  You may change your personal information, at any time while you
  are online, by going to the MSN Explorer Member Services pages under
  "Help/Settings" at the top of the MSN Explorer home page.</p>
  <p><img border="0" width="18" height="15" src="http://msimg.com/w/top_hlp.gif" alt="top">
  <a href="#top">Top</a> </p>
  <p><b>MSN Hotmail</b><a name="MSNMAIL"></a></p>
  <p><b>What information is collected:</b> Hotmail collects
  information during the registration process. The personally 
  identifiable information Hotmail collects includes first and 
  last name. In addition, Hotmail also collects non-personally identifiable 
  information such as: country, region or state, zip or postal code, time 
  zone, gender, birth date and occupation. You may 
  update your Registration Information at any time from within your Hotmail 
  account by clicking the "Options" button on the navigation bar, and then 
  clicking on the "Personal" icon.</p>
  <p><b>How does MSN use my information:</b> Your registration information is used to operate
  the site, for demographic statistics, and to display appropriate
  individualized advertisements.
  Hotmail will not send you any unsolicited 
      information, including e-mail, except as mentioned below. New users will 
      receive a Hotmail welcome letter explaining the features provided by the 
      service. Hotmail may also send periodic member letters to announce 
      important service changes, new features, technical issue updates and news 
      about other Microsoft products and services. Hotmail may also contact you 
      to conduct research about your opinion of current and prospective services 
      via e-mail surveys. Hotmail may from time to time contact you, on behalf 
      of external business partners, about a particular offering that may be of 
      interest to you. Hotmail will not share your e-mail address with these 
      business partners.</p>
  <p><b>Who else may receive my personal information:</b> Hotmail keeps your 
      personally identifiable information private and 
      does not share it with any third parties, unless you choose, at the time 
      of registration, to be listed
  in either the Hotmail Directory or the Internet White Pages directory. In the case 
      of the Internet White Pages, we will share your registered name, location, 
      and e-mail address with the Internet White pages provider InfoSpace who 
      may only use your personally identifiable information to
  provide their directory services.
  For more information about how to 
      change you directory preferences, see the FAQ below. Hotmail will not disclose your Personal 
      Information unless acting under a good faith belief that such action is 
      necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal 
      process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft; (3) 
      enforce the MSN Hotmail Terms of Use; or (4) act to protect the interests 
      of its members or others.</p>
  <p>Your non-personally identifiable information from 
      your Hotmail registration (such as zip code and gender) may be shared with 
      other Microsoft websites to provide a more personalized advertising 
      experience online. For example, you may see ads from a Microsoft 
      bCentral/LinkExchange Banner Network member as you surf the 
      Web but none of your personally identifiable information is shared with the third party 
      websites.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><b>What can I do to manage unsolicited e-mail in my 
      Hotmail account?</b> Hotmail
  will not sell, lease or rent its member lists with any third parties. While
  Microsoft continues to actively review and implement new technology, such as
  expanded filtering features, there is no currently available technology that
  will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. Using tools such as the Inbox Protector 
      and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while online 
      will help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive. For more 
      information on how to best
  use Hotmail's tools, please contact <a href="mailto:Abuse@hotmail.com">Abuse@hotmail.com</a>.</p>
  <p>How do I control my personal information: You 
      may update your Registration Information at any time from within your 
      Hotmail account by clicking the "Options" button on the navigation bar, 
      and then clicking on the "Personal" icon.</p>
  <p><b>How can I change my preferences for the Hotmail Directory and Internet White Pages?</b></p>
  <p>During the Hotmail registration process you are 
      given the choice as to whether you want to be listed in the Hotmail 
      Directory and the Internet White Pages. If 
      you did not make a choice during the initial registration process, your 
      registered name and location is listed in the Hotmail Directory and the 
      Internet White Pages. At any time, you may remove your information from
  the Hotmail Directory by clicking on the "Options" button on the
  navigation bar, and then clicking on the "Personal" icon. To remove
  your e-mail address from the Internet White Pages, go to <a href="http://www.msn.com/">www.msn.com</a>,click on “More,”
  click on "White Pages", click on "Email Search" where you may register or
  delete your e-mail address.</p>

  social nickname, you will simply be identified as a "Guest."</p>
  <p>At MSN Web Communities, MSN Chat, MSN Gaming Zone and
  Microsoft Passport, MSN gives you the opportunity to create a public profile
  of yourself. The public profile contains personal information - such as your
  hobbies and interests - that you have volunteered about yourself so that
  other participants in MSN chat rooms, MSN Web Communities or other public
  places can learn something about you. All such information is optional and
  everything you enter in your public profile will be visible to the public.</p>
  <p>Your MSN social nickname and the information in your
  public profile is used by the MSN Chat, MSN Web Communities, MSN Gaming Zone,
  and Microsoft Passport Web sites to enhance your experience on those sites.
  None of this information is shared with any third parties. Your social
  nickname and public profile information are available and visible to other
  MSN visitors and customers using the site. MSN urges you to be careful only
  to enter information on your public profile that you are comfortable sharing
  with the public at large. You may change, edit or delete information about
  yourself from your public profile at any time while online by going to Public
  Profiles, Edit Your Public Profile. You may also select a different social
  nickname at any time.</p>
  <p>While participating in chats, communities or other public
  forums, MSN cautions you against giving out personally identifiable information
  (such as names and addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, credit
  card numbers, and driver's license numbers) to strangers online, which they
  may use for illegal or harmful purposes.</p>
