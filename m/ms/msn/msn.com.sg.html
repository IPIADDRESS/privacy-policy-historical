				<p class="title">MSN Privacy Statement
					<br>
					<span class="li" style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">(last updated: March 2005)</span></p>
				<p>Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy.  Please read the MSN Privacy Statement below and also any supplementary information at the end of this statement for additional details about particular MSN sites and services that you may use.</p>
				<p>This MSN Privacy Statement applies to data collected by Microsoft through its MSN sites and services; it does not apply to data collected through other online or offline Microsoft sites, products or services. Other Microsoft sites and services linked to from this Web site, including <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/privacy.mspx">microsoft.com</a>, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=21970">MapPoint</a>, <a href="http://www.windowsmedia.com/Mediaguide/Privacy">WindowsMedia.com</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/zh-SG/privacystatement.htm">Xbox.com</a> have their own privacy statements which can be viewed by clicking on the links.</p>
				<p>This Statement contains a section with specific details regarding personal information collected from children. Click <a href="#CHILDREN">here</a> to read more.</p>
				<p class="title">Collection of your Personal Information</p>
				<p>In order to sign in to MSN services, you will be asked to enter an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your MSN credentials.  If you access our services via a mobile phone, your credentials will consist of your telephone number and a PIN.  As part of creating your MSN credentials, you may also be requested to provide an alternate email address, and questions and secret answers, which we use to verify your identity and assist in resetting your password.  Some services may require added security, and in these cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key.  Finally, a unique ID number will be assigned to your MSN credentials which will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.</p>
				<p>If you have an e-mail address that has been provided by MSN (e.g. those ending in msn.com, hotmail.com, or webtv.net) that e-mail address and the associated password are your MSN credentials. You may also use any other <a href="http://www.passport.net/">Microsoft Passport Network</a> credentials to sign into most MSN services.</p>
				<p>At some MSN sites, Microsoft collects personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. Information collected on MSN may be combined with information obtained from other Microsoft services and other companies.</p>
				<p>If you choose to sign up for a paid subscription service (such as MSN Internet Access or MSN Extra Storage), we will collect information, such as your credit card number and billing address, that is used to create a Microsoft billing account.</p>
				<p>Some MSN services, such as MSN Groups, request that you create a social nickname, which is the name you will be known by to others in those public places. You may select a different social nickname at any time. You can also choose to create an optional public profile, containing information about yourself - such as your hobbies and interests. Any information you choose to enter in your public profile will be visible to other users of Microsoft sites and services; and when you interact with other users (for example, sending an MSN Hotmail message to another MSN email account), a link to your public profile may be displayed. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information through MSN Groups, or other public online forums, this information may be collected and used by others. We caution you against providing personal information to strangers online, which they may use for illegal or harmful purposes.</p>
				<p>We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with MSN sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.</p>
				<p>Some MSN services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Microsoft and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.</p>
				<p class="title">Use of your Personal Information</p>
				<p>Microsoft collects and uses your personal information to operate MSN and deliver the services you have requested. These services may include the display of customized content and advertising based upon the information we have collected. In order to provide services in conjunction with other Microsoft products or services, personal information collected on MSN may be accessed and used by other Microsoft services as necessary to provide such services. Any use of such information within Microsoft will remain subject to the limitations of this privacy statement.</p>
				<p>We also use your personal information to communicate with you.  We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some MSN services, including MSN Internet Access and MSN Hotmail, may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service.  We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Microsoft and its affiliates.</p>
				<p>Microsoft does not sell, rent or lease its MSN customer lists to third parties. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.</p>
				<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
				<p>Microsoft may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft, including its MSN family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of MSN services or members of the public.</p>
				<p>Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</p>
				<p class="title">Using Your MSN Credentials at Sites on the Passport Network</p>
				<p>Your MSN credentials (e-mail address and password) are part of the Microsoft Passport Network, which means you can also use your MSN credentials to sign into sites and services outside of MSN that are part of the Passport Network.</p>
				<p>When you use your MSN credentials to sign into a site on the Passport Network, that sign-in will be temporarily logged for the purpose of ensuring the efficiency and security of the Passport Network. This information in the logs is identified only by your account's unique ID number, and it is not linked with personal information unless you call to request assistance.</p>
				<p>Certain information will be shared with sites and services that you choose to sign-in to on the Passport Network. The unique ID number associated with your MSN credential is shared with the site or service when you sign-in, so it can determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next. The following "operational" information will be shared with sites when you sign in: the version number assigned to your account (a new number is assigned each time you change your sign-in information); whether your e-mail address has been confirmed; and whether your account has been deactivated.</p>
				<p>Additionally, certain sites and services on the Passport Network require your e-mail address in order to provide you with their services. In those cases, your e-mail address will be provided when you sign in to those services.  Your password is not shared as part of sign-in, however, the site where you created your credentials may have limited access to credential information in order to help you reset your password or provide other support services. </p>
				<p>Please note that sites and services on the Passport Network can use or share your e-mail address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements. However they can only share your unique ID number with third parties in order to fulfill a service or transaction you may have requested.  All sites or services on the Passport Network are required to have a posted privacy statement, but we do not control or monitor the privacy practices of sites on the Passport Network, and the privacy practices of those sites will vary. You should carefully review the privacy statement for each site you sign in to in order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects.</p>
				<p>More information about the Microsoft Passport Network is available at <a href="http://www.passport.net">http://www.passport.net</a>.</p>
				<p class="title">Control of your Personal Information</p>
				<p>We offer you choices for the collection, use and sharing of your personal information. You may go to the <a href="http://privacy.msn.com.sg/choice/default.asp">MSN Communications Preferences</a> page to make choices about the use of your personal information. You may choose not to receive marketing material from MSN or on behalf of external third party business partners. You may also stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from MSN by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive.</p>
				<p>You may subscribe and unsubscribe to MSN Newsletters by going to <a href="http://newsletters.msn.com">newsletters.msn.com</a>. In addition, each MSN newsletter you receive will have instructions on how to unsubscribe prominently mentioned in it.</p>
				<p>These communications choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are considered part of certain MSN services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the service.</p>
				<p>You may have the ability to view or edit your personal information:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you wish to update your MSN profile information, change your password, view the unique ID associated with your credentials, or close certain MSN accounts, please visit MSN Account Services at <a href="http://accountservices.msn.com">http://accountservices.msn.com</a>.</li>
					<li>If you have a billing account you can add to or update the information through the Account Update area located at <a href="https://billing.microsoft.com">https://billing.microsoft.com</a>.</li>
					<li>If you have created a public profile on MSN, you may also edit or delete information in your public profile by going to <a href="http://members.msn.com/edit.msnw">http://members.msn.com/edit.msnw</a>.</li>
					<li>If you buy MSN Keyword advertising, you can review and edit your personal information at <a href="http://www.adcenter.msn.sg/">http://adcenter.msn.com/</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some services offered on MSN may collect personal information that is not accessible via the links above. However, in such cases, you may be able to access that information through alternative means of access described by the service.  Or you can write us by using our <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=2606703">Web form</a>, and we will contact you within 30 days regarding your request.</p>
				<p>We will delete your sign-in credentials if they remain inactive for an extended period of time.  Inactivity is defined as a failure to sign in to any site or service on the Passport Network using your credentials. If your credentials are associated with a free MSN or Hotmail e-mail inbox, your account will be made inaccessible if it remains inactive for 120 days, and any account information you have provided will be deleted.  If you have credentials on the Passport Network that are not associated with a free MSN or Hotmail e-mail inbox, your account will be made inaccessible if it remains inactive for 365 days, and any information you have provided will be deleted. Accounts associated with paid subscriptions for MSN or Hotmail are not made inaccessible due to inactivity.</p>
				<p class="title">Security of your Personal Information</p>
				<p>Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
				<a name="CHILDREN"></a>
				<p class="title">Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</p>
				<p>MSN offers a special MSN Kids area that is specifically designed for children at <a href="http://kids.msn.com/">http://kids.msn.com/</a>. MSN Kids has a special <a href="http://g.msn.com/0PRKids/enus">privacy statement</a> that informs children and parents about the MSN Kids area, describes the additional privacy protections provided in this area, and provides children with tips on how to protect themselves online.</p>
				<p>The rest of MSN is intended for users of all ages. Children may visit these general audience areas of MSN and provide personal information, which will be collected, used and disclosed as described is this Privacy Statement.</p>
				<!--<p>When we collect age information and users identify themselves as under 13, we will obtain consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information on MSN as described in this Privacy Statement. If we change this MSN Privacy Statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent. Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of their children's personal information, by visiting <a href="http://accountservices.msn.com/">Account Services</a>, and clicking on "Permission for kids."</p>
				<p><b>Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use MSN services, this will include such general audience communication services as MSN Groups, MSN Messenger, and MSN Hotmail, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages.</b> We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child can visit <a href="http://www.msn.staysafeonline.com/">MSN's Stay Safe Online</a> site for additional information about using the Internet safely.</p>-->
				<p>If you have an MSN Premium, MSN Plus, or MSN 9 Dial-Up account, you can choose to set up MSN Parental Controls for the other users of that account. Further information is included <a href="#MSNPREM">below</a>.</p>
				<p class="title">Use of Cookies</p>
				<p>MSN uses "cookies" to enable you to sign in to MSN services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.</p>
				<p>MSN uses cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to MSN.</p>
				<p>When you sign in to a site using your MSN credentials, the Microsoft Passport Network stores your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page.  When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. The Passport Network also uses cookies to improve the sign in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out.  This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in.  If you are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.</p>
				<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of MSN sites and services that depend on cookies.</p>
				<p class="title">Use of Web Beacons</p>
				<p>MSN Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow MSN to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. MSN may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or MSN Newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
				<p>MSN may also place Web beacons from third parties on our site in order to compile aggregated statistics and to help determine the effectiveness of our joint promotional or advertising campaigns. MSN prohibits Web beacons on our site from being used by third parties to access your personal information.</p>
				<p>Finally, MSN may work with other companies that advertise on MSN to place Web beacons on their sites in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on MSN results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site.</p>
				<p class="title">Use of Third Party Ad Networks</p>
				<p>The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on MSN Web pages are displayed by MSN.  However, MSN allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on MSN Web pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Microsoft does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.</p>
				<p>MSN maintains relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks currently operating such as: Ad4Ever; AdCentric Online; Ad Dynamix; AdSolution; Avenue A; BlueStreak; BridgeTrack; DoubleClick; efluxa; Enliven; Flycast; i33; Mediaplex; PlanetActive; Pointroll; Profero; Qksrv; RealMedia; RedAgency; TangoZebra; TargetGraph; TrackStar; Travelworm; Unicast. Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. You may find more information at the Web site of either the individual ad network or the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>.</p>
				<p class="title">Controlling "Spam" or Unsolicited E-mail</p>
				<p>Microsoft is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or "spam." Microsoft has a strict policy prohibiting the use of a Hotmail or other MSN e-mail account to send spam. To read more about this policy, go to <a href="http://privacy.msn.com.sg/anti-spam/default.asp">http://privacy.msn.com.sg/anti-spam/default.asp</a>.  Microsoft will not sell, lease or rent its e-mail subscriber lists to third parties. While Microsoft continues to actively review and implement new technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. Using tools such as the Inbox Protector and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive. For more information on how to best use Hotmail's tools, please select "help" from within Hotmail or contact <a href="mailto:abuse@hotmail.com">abuse@hotmail.com</a>.</p>
				<!--<p class="title">TRUSTe Certification</p>
				<p>Microsoft is a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.</p>-->
				<p class="title">Enforcement of this Privacy Statement</p>
				<p>If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact MSN Privacy by clicking <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=2606703">here</a>. <!--If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>. TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with Microsoft to resolve your concerns.--></p>
				<p class="title">Changes to this Statement</p>
				<p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we posts changes to this Statement, you will see the word "updated" next to the MSN Privacy Statement link on the front page of MSN. If there are material changes to this Statement or in how Microsoft will use your personal information, we will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Microsoft is protecting your information.</p>

				<p class="title">MSN Premium/MSN Plus/MSN 9 Dial-Up</p>
				<p>Through MSN registration, you will create MSN credentials (e-mail address and password) for each user, which will be used for signing into the service. When you sign into MSN Premium/MSN Plus or MSN 9 Dial-Up, you will also be signed into to MSN sites you visit or services you use.</p>
				<p>MSN will automatically check the version of MSN Premium/MSN Plus or MSN 9 Dial-Up and components you are using (including your browser version) every time you sign into the service in order to optimize performance. MSN may also provide upgrades to such software that will be automatically installed on your computer.</p>
				<p><b>MSN Parental Controls</b><br>
					MSN Premium/ MSN Plus&nbsp;and MSN 9 Dial-Up account managers can choose to set 
					up MSN Parental Controls for the people who use that account. The account 
					manager is the person who subscribes to MSN. Because it is typically a parent or guardian
					enabling this feature for a child, the terms "parent" and "child" will be used 
					to describe this feature.</p>
				<p>E-mail notification: When a parent configures Parental Controls for a child, the 
					child will receive an e-mail message describing the service and notifying him 
					or her that Parental Controls have been set for the account.</p>
				<p>Online activity report: Parents can choose to enable online reporting for a 
					child who has Parental Controls set for his or her account. If this feature is 
					enabled, information about how a child uses the Internet will be stored 
					temporarily on the child's computer. This information is periodically sent to 
					the parent by e-mail from the child's account and is then deleted from the 
					child's computer.</p>
				<p>Contact lists: Parents may also choose to control the list of people that a 
					child can correspond with using MSN Mail or MSN Messenger. The list of contacts 
					specified for the child is stored on MSN servers so that the child will be 
					protected whenever and wherever he or she uses MSN Mail or Messenger. The list 
					of contacts can be edited by the parent or can be deleted by deleting the 
					child's account.</p>
				<p>Task requests: A child may request permission to complete a task that a parent 
					has blocked. For example, the child can request access to a blocked Web site or 
					for the ability to exchange e-mail messages with a new friend. MSN stores this 
					automated request for a brief period, allowing the parent to review, allow, or 
					deny the request from any computer using MSN Premium/ MSN Plus&nbsp;or MSN 9 
					Dial-Up.</p>
				<p><b>MSN Customer Experience Improvement Program</b><br>
					The MSN Customer Experience Improvement Program is an optional service in which 
					you can choose to participate. If you choose to participate, you allow 
					Microsoft to collect anonymous information about how you use Microsoft software 
					and services, as well as some information about your computer.</p>
				<p>MSN performs this service to help us identify trends and usage patterns and 
					improve Microsoft software and services. The Customer Experience Improvement 
					Program can be turned on or off at any time in MSN Premium/ MSN Plus or MSN9 
					Dial-Up Software on the Privacy settings page.</p>
				<p>This trend and usage information includes anonymous information about how you 
					use the software. For example, this may include whether you clicked on a 
					particular button or menu item, how many email messages you sent with pictures, 
					or whether the dashboard is turned on or off.
				</p>
				<p>Please note your decision to participate in the Customer Experience Improvement 
					Program does not affect the collection of anonymous performance information 
					about the MSN software and service that Microsoft collects as an essential part 
					of providing you and all MSN customers a reliable, quality service. This 
					performance information may include, for example, how many times you attempt to 
					sign in or how long it takes on average to open the home page. All of this 
					information is anonymous and does not include any personal information</p>
				<p><b>Critical Performance Errors</b><br>
					You may occasionally see a message informing you of a critical performance 
					error in MSN Premium/ MSN Plus or MSN 9 Dial-Up. This message will ask you to 
					send data to MSN. If you agree, MSN Software will automatically collect and 
					send the data needed to help MSN determine what caused the error.
				</p>
				<p>Before you choose to send your data to MSN, you have the opportunity to review 
					that data. If you choose to send the data, in some cases your personal 
					information may also be sent to MSN. This personal information is deleted 
					before Microsoft reviews the error data you send.</p>
				<p><b>Import Wizard</b><br>
					MSN Premium/MSN Plus and MSN 9 Dial-Up offers you the chance to import 
					some information from your computer such as your Favorites from Internet 
					Explorer, your e-mail messages from Outlook Express and your Address Book from

				<p class="title">MSN Search and Toolbar</p>
				<p>Each time you use MSN Search, including the MSN Toolbar, cookies may be placed 
					on your machine and MSN may collect your Internet IP address, the time and date 
					of your search terms, and your browser configuration. MSN may use this 
					information to customize your search results.</p>
				<p>If you choose the "Near Me" Search feature, MSN will attempt to derive your approximate location based on your IP address, and will use that information to display search results tailored to your geographic location.  You can change your default location by clicking on the "Settings" link on the search page, and your location, along with other search settings, will be stored in a cookie on your machine.</p>
				<p>While you have MSN Toolbar installed, please note that new versions of the MSN 
					Toolbar will automatically be installed on your computer. This keeps your 
					Toolbar up-to-date and lets you take advantage of new features as soon as they 
					are available.</p>
				<p>If you choose to install and use Desktop Search, you can search for e-mail, documents and other files located on your computer directly from the Toolbar.  No information about the files on your computer will be sent to Microsoft as part of this process.  Instead, Desktop Search will index the content of you computer and store the index file on your computer.  You can customize Desktop Search to index only specified folders on your computer.  Desktop search will not store copies of e-mail or documents after they are deleted.</p>
				<p>The MSN Toolbar also includes an optional feature that can automatically fill out forms on Web sites with information such as your address, passwords, and credit card information so that you do not have to repeatedly type the same information or remember multiple passwords. This information is encrypted and saved on your computer; it is not sent to Microsoft. The Toolbar will prompt you to create a single "form fill password."  You must enter the form fill password every time you wish to automatically enter a stored credit card number and the first time each browser session you wish to automatically enter a stored password.</p>
				<p>Toolbar users will be given a choice to participate in CEIP, Microsoft's Customer Experience Improvement Program. If you participate, the MSN Toolbar may track how you use the toolbar,  the websites you visit, and your actions while reviewing MSN Search results, all on an anonymous basis. Such actions may include which results are visited and how much time is spent on a particular search results page. None of this activity is traced back to you personally, even if you are signed into your Passport, and is used solely to improve the MSN Search experience for all MSN users.</p>

				<p class="title">MSN Calendar and Address Book</p>
				<p>The MSN Calendar and Address Book stores contact information you enter there 
					about yourself and others including calendar appointments, email address, first 
					and last name, nickname, home address, work address, phone number, and 
					birthdate. You may view, edit, and share that information with your friends and 
					acquaintances.</p>
				<p>There are two ways your calendar data may be viewed by others:
				</p>
				<p>For 1-to-1 calendar sharing, with side by side appointment views, both you and 
					your friend must be a subscriber to an MSN service.</p>
				<p>In this case, your calendar is shared only with specific contacts, those 
					contacts must authenticate with a Microsoft Passport and you must give 
					permission to those contacts to view your calendar.</p>
				<p>For public calendar access, any person with access to the Internet may view your 
					calendar if you decide to "publish" your calendar to msn.com/calendar.

				<p class="title">MSN Messenger</p>
				<p>When you sign up for the .NET Messenger Service ("Service") through the MSN 
					Messenger software, MSN requests your e-mail address, a 
					"friendly" name that you choose, a phone number (optional), and the list of 
					"contacts" with whom you can send and receive instant messages and similar 
					information about those "contacts." Your list of "contacts" and their 
					information may also be available to you from other MSN services. Only 
					authorized MSN customer service representatives may access this information, 
					upon your request, to assist you in using the Service. Go to Tools Options in 
					MSN Messenger to change your friendly name, phone number, or any other 
					information.</p>
				<p>MSN Messenger offers an optional service, called the Customer Experience 
					Improvement Program, designed to help improve the technical quality of 
					Microsoft products and services. If you choose to participate, you allow us to 
					collect anonymous information about how you use our software and services, as 
					well as some information about your computer. All of this information is 
					anonymous and does not include any personal information.</p>
				<p>For example, this program collects information about the performance of the 
					Service, the time it takes you to sign-in, error messages that you might 
					encounter as you use the Service, whether each message reaches the recipient, 
					and what type of Internet connection you use.</p>

				<p class="title">MSN Personal Domains</p>
				<p>To fulfill your domain name request, MSN uses several accredited Registrars to

				<p class="title">MSN Direct</p>
				<p>The MSN Direct is a specialized wireless service that delivers personalized 
					information through the FM subcarrier radio network to enabled watches. All 
					information sent over the network is encrypted for security and each watch has 
					a unique ID to ensure that only your watch can display the content intended 
					specifically for you - such as your calendar or messages.</p>
				<p>Watches with MSN Direct are one-way information receiving devices. They do not 
					broadcast any information, such as your location, that could be received by MSN 
					or others. There are, however, two ways in which MSN Direct may collect 
					information about your general location.</p>
				<p>When you sign up for the service on the MSN Direct website, we will collect an 
					activation code that will be displayed on your watch. This code will identify 
					the radio tower from which your watch is receiving a signal. This information 
					indicates which metropolitan area you were in at time of sign-up.</p>
				<p>You can also provide, at the MSN Direct website, information about where you 
					live and where you commute. This location data allows us to send you relevant 
					information for your locale, such as traffic updates. In addition, you can also 
					provide your travel locations so that personalized information can be 
					temporarily re-routed to broadcast towers near you when you are away from home.

				<p class="title">MSN Zone</p>
				<p>To play games on the MSN Zone, we request that you create a social nickname 
					which is the name you will be known by to others in public areas. Inside the Zone it is also possible to create an optional Zone Profile. This Zone 
					Profile contains information about the games you like to play, your favorite 
					URL, a description of your interests, and scores you might have attained if you 
					visited any of the rated rooms on the site. All such information is optional 
					and everything you enter in your Zone Profile will be visible to other users of 
					the Zone. MSN urges you to be careful only to enter information on your Zone 
					Profile that you are comfortable sharing with the public at large. You may 
					edit, delete, or modify information in your Zone Profile at any time by 
					clicking on "Support," then "My Account Information."</p>
				<p>The Zone also hosts a small number of premium games. To participate in these 
					optional games a fee is charged. In order to collect this fee, the Zone 
					requests your billing information in order to process a credit card transaction 
					for this service.</p>
