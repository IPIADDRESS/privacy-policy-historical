<p><b><a name="adchoices"></a>PERSONALIZED CONTENT AND ADVERTISING AND YOUR CHOICES</b></p>
<p><i>Online Analytics</i></p>
<p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics.&nbsp; These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the “Information We Collect” section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p><i>Tailored Advertising</i></p>
<p>We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on MSG websites or applications. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of our Services. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form and content that you share publicly when using the services (e.g, user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>&nbsp; or <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TRUSTe’s Advertising Choices Page</a> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Services and learn more about our advertising practices through the About Our Ads link available through the Services.</p>
<p>To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Settings page</a>. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.</p>
<p>Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p><b>California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice Concerning Do Not Track Signals</b></p>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide links to the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> opt-out pages, as well as choices provided by Google Ads and Google Analytics. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>SECURITY</b><br>
We have implemented commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and/or alteration of your information. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store. &nbsp;However, we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since despite our efforts, no Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure.</p>
