</strong>We may share your information with any agent or company that is part of the MSGN Family of companies in order to provide the Services or advertising or to communicate with you. The MSGN Family of companies may disclose and/or share your information to or with any non-affiliated third parties under the following circumstances.</p>
<p>Consent: We may disclose your information with non-affiliated third parties based on your consent to do so. Such consent includes the disclosure of your information (a) in order to provide services or products that you have requested; (b) when we have your permission; or (c) as described in this Policy.</p>
<p>Service Providers. We may provide access to your information to select third parties who perform services on our behalf and for any other legitimate business purposes. These third parties provide a variety of services to us, including without limitation, billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, and legal services. MSGN generally seeks contractual assurances from these service providers that they will not use your information in any&nbsp;manner other than to help us provide you with the services and products available from MSGN.</p>
<p>Other Third Parties. Unless you direct us not to, we may share your information with reputable third parties so that they may contact you to offer products, services and promotions, such as sweepstakes and contests, that you may find valuable. We may also share your information with third-party advertising networks or others with whom we have a contractual relationship. You can instruct us not to provide your personal information to these third parties by sending an email to privacy@msgnetworks.com with “REMOVE THIRD PARTIES” in the subject line. If you receive a communication from a third party and you do not wish to receive future communications from that party, you should also tell them to remove you from their marketing list.</p>
<p>Protection of MSGN and Others. By using the Services, you acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your information, including, but not limited to, any user content, if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce our <a href="http://corporate.msgnetworks.com/terms/">Terms of Service</a>, this Policy, or other contracts with you; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of MSGN, its agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public. We may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies in emergency circumstances, where the disclosure of such information is consistent with the types of emergency disclosures permitted or required by law.</p>
<p>Business Transfers. We reserve the right to disclose and transfer all of your information, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all, or components, of our business.</p>
<p><strong>CONSENT TO TRANSFER<br>
</strong>The Services are operated in the United States and are governed by United States law. If you are a resident of the European Union or other location outside the United States, please be advised that any information you provide through the Services will be transferred to the United States or other designated locations outside of the United States for certain processing/hosting operations. We have taken commercially reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is appropriately protected and is processed only in accordance with this Policy. By using the Services, you consent to this transfer and to the use of the personal information as described herein.</p>
<p><strong>OPTING OUT OF USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR MARKETING PURPOSES BY MSGN FAMILY<br>
</strong>If you have provided personal information while using the Services and later decide that you would rather not have the MSGN Family use personal information for marketing purposes in accordance with this Policy, you can opt-out of future use at any time by: (i) going to the link provided at the bottom of any email you receive from a MSGN Family member and opting out of receiving information from that MSGN Family member; (ii) by sending us an email at privacy@msgnetworks.com including your name&nbsp;and email address; or (iii) writing us at MSGN Holdings, L.P., 11 Penn Plaza, 3rd Floor, New York, New York, 10001, Attn: Vice President, Marketing and with a copy to Vice President, Legal and Business Affairs at the same address, including your name and email address.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONALIZED CONTENT AND ADVERTISING AND YOUR CHOICES<br>
</strong>Online Analytics</p>
<p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the “Information We Collect” section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.</p>
<p>Tailored Advertising</p>
<p>We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on MSGN websites or applications. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of our Services. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form and content that you share publicly when using the services (e.g, user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more&nbsp;information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link , the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link or TRUSTe’s Advertising Choices Page to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Services and learn more about our advertising practices through the About Our Ads link available through the Services.</p>
<p>To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.</p>
<p>Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p><strong>CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT NOTICE CONCERNING DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS<br>
</strong>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide links to the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out pages, as well as choices provided by Google Ads and Google Analytics. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION<br>
</strong>To keep your information accurate, current and complete, visit your account page(s) or email privacy@msgnetworks.com to update and/or correct certain information previously provided. If a member name and password are required to access the feature, you will need to provide such information to update your registration information. If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it by visiting the registration area and requesting that a hint be sent to you at the email address you originally provided during registration.</p>
<p><strong>LINKS<br>
</strong>Links to third-party websites, applications and other services may be made available through the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party services. Any information you provide via those services is subject to the applicable privacy policies and is not covered by this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
We have implemented commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and/or alteration of your information. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since despite our efforts, no Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong><br>
California Law permits visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@msgnetworks.com or write to us at MSGN Holdings, L.P., 11 Pennsylvania Plaza, 3rd Floor, New York, New York 10001, Attn: Vice President, Marketing and with a copy to Vice President, Legal and Business Affairs and the same address.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</strong><br>
MSGN does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information directly from children under the age of 13. If we discover we have received any personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13 in violation of this Policy, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe MSGN has any information from or about anyone under the age of 13, please contact us at the address listed below.</p>
<p><strong>CONTACTING US ABOUT THIS POLICY</strong><br>
Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions, concerns, requests or comments by email at feedback@msgnetworks.com or write to us at MSGN Holdings, L.P., 11 Pennsylvania Plaza, 3rd Floor,</p>

</strong>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this Policy will mean you accept those changes.</p>
