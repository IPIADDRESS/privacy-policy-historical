<h2>What are cookies?</h2>


<p>What are cookies? Cookies are small text-files that are memorized on the computer when a user visits a website. The text memorizes information that the website is able to read when it is accessed the second time. Some of these cookies are essential for a website to run correctly, while others are used to store information in a safe way, for instance, user names or language settings. The advantage of having cookies installed on your own pc is that you don’t need to re-enter the same authentication information every time you view a web page that you had viewed previously.</p>


<h2>Why does our site use cookies?</h2>


<p>Our site uses cookies in order to provide users a customized buying experience which matches their tastes and preferences. Thanks to cookies, you won’t need to send or receive the saved information over and over. Cookies are used also for the optimization of the website’s performances: indeed, they speed up the purchase process, as well as they facilitate the research of specific contents within the site. In order to protect your own personal data against possible losses and any form of illicit treatment, we have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures. For further information, please refer to our Privacy policy.</p>


<h2>What cookies do we use and for what purpose?</h2>

<h2>Third-party cookies for marketing and retargeting</h2>


<p>These cookies are used by third-party companies that we trust to show you advertising banners on other affiliate websites, featuring the latest products you have viewed on our site. While you are browsing our website, these cookies are also used to show you banners featuring products that you may be interested in, or similar to products you have previously viewed based on your browsing history. The usage of these cookies does not usually imply the processing of personal data but it may create a connection with your computer or other devices and track the information stored in it: these cookies are then connected to the browser installed on your computer or other device used during the navigation on our website.</p>


<h2>Social media cookies</h2>
