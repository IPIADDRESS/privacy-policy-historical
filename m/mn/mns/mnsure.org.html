<h2>Notice of Privacy Practices</h2>
<p>This notice tells how protected information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get this information. Please review it carefully.</p>

<a class="faqQuestion" rel="answer1" href="#">What information does MNsure ask for?</a>
<div class="faqBlock" id="answer1" style="display: none;">
<a name="answer1"></a>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several activities you can do on MNsure, and we collect different information for each of the different reasons you may visit the site. <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="/resources/privacy-warnings.jsp" title="Privacy Warnings - Account Creation" xlink:href="/resources/privacy-warnings.jsp" xlink:title="04-Privacy Warnings - Account Creation">MNsure’s privacy warnings</a> (also called Tennessen Warnings) are designed to provide you with information about how your private data may be used and shared in proximity to when that data is being collected. For example, as part of evaluating your eligibility for purchasing coverage through MNsure, we collect information including your name, address, citizenship status, residence, household members (if purchasing coverage for household members), contact information, Social Security number, and other private data. If you are seeking financial assistance to pay for insurance coverage, we also collect income information. These privacy warnings located through the online application will notify you of how the data will be used prior to collection and enable you to make an informed decision about whether or not to provide data about yourself to MNsure. The MNsure privacy warnings in the online application are consolidated and available for downloading and printing here. Please note that not every notice will necessarily apply to your activities on MNsure.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="faqQuestion" rel="answer2" href="#">Why do we ask for this information?</a>
<div class="faqBlock" id="answer2" style="display: none;">
<a name="answer2"></a>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We need to tell you apart from other people with the same or similar name, to decide what you are eligible for, to help you enroll in health insurance programs, to make reports, conduct audits and research, to evaluate our programs, to investigate fraud, and to collect money from the state or federal government for the services we provide.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="faqQuestion" rel="answer3" href="#">Why do we ask you for your Social Security number and immigration information?</a>
<div class="faqBlock" id="answer3" style="display: none;">
<a name="answer3"></a>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We need your Social Security number to tell you apart from other people, to prevent duplication of state and federal benefits, and to verify income, resources or other information that may affect your eligibility and benefits. This information is voluntary, but you will not be able to receive an eligibility determination without it. You do not have to give us a Social Security number for persons in your home who are not applying for coverage or if you have religious objections. If you are permanently living in the U.S. without permission or approval from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, you do not need to provide your Social Security number, but you may not be eligible to enroll in benefits or plans offered on MNsure. Immigration information you give to us is used to see if you are eligible to get coverage. Pub. Law 111-148, Section 1312(f)(3). We only share it when the law allows it or requires it, and this includes verification against state and federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration. Pub. Law 111-148, Section 1411(b)(2). You do not have to give us immigration information about yourself if you are helping someone else apply or about anyone in your household who is not applying for coverage. For Medicaid, you do not have to provide immigration information if you are applying for emergency medical care only or are a pregnant woman living in the U.S.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="faqQuestion" rel="answer4" href="#">Why do we ask for income information?</a>
<div class="faqBlock" id="answer4" style="display: none;">
<a name="answer4"></a>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We ask for income information to determine eligibility for public assistance programs and tax credits, and we verify this income information against state and federal sources including the IRS and SSA. You are not required to provide income information. Income information is necessary in order to seek a subsidy or tax credit, but you can proceed with purchasing a plan without subsidies or tax credits. We do not share income information outside of the eligibility process except as authorized by law. It may be shared with state and local government entities to determine eligibility for other assistance programs, with our own staff to provide customer service, as part of the appeals process if you are challenging an eligibility determination, or with state and federal revenue agencies to reconcile tax credits. You are solely responsible for any tax consequences that result from your report of income or acceptance of subsidies and tax credits.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="faqQuestion" rel="answer5" href="#">Do you have to answer the questions we ask?</a>
<div class="faqBlock" id="answer5" style="display: none;">
<a name="answer5"></a>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You do not have to give us your personal information. Without the information, we may not be able to help you. If you give us wrong information on purpose, you can be investigated and charged with fraud.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<a class="faqQuestion" rel="answer6" href="#">With whom may we share information?</a>
<div class="faqBlock" id="answer6" style="display: none;">
<a name="answer6"></a>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We will only share information about you as needed and as allowed or required by law. We may share your information with agencies or persons who need the information to do their jobs, such as MNsure employees, investigators and auditors, community assistance partners you are working with, law enforcement officials, other state, federal and local governmental agencies, your health care insurer, agency, managed care organization or others who pay for your care, and anyone else authorized by law to receive the information. Please see the applicable privacy warnings for specific information with whom your data may be shared.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You and people you have given informed consent to may inspect and copy public and private information we have about you. This is called a data practices request. If you request data held by MNsure, you may view and inspect at no charge, or if you request copies, you may have to pay copy costs as outlined below.</p>

Within 30 days, MNsure will either (1) correct the data found to be inaccurate or incomplete and attempt to notify past recipients of inaccurate or incomplete data; or (2) notify you that MNsure believes the data to be correct. If there is a request to disclose data in dispute, MNsure will attach your statement of disagreement to the disclosed data. You can appeal MNsure’s determination to the Commissioner of Administration according to Minn. Stat. § 13.04, subd. 4.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You also have the right to see a record of the people or organizations with which we have shared your information. You must ask for a copy of this record in writing to our Privacy and Security Manager.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a parent, you have the right to look at and get copies of public and private data about your minor children (under the age of 18).

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MNsure website provides a large variety of public information about MNsure, its contracts and funding, and commonly-asked questions related to enrolling in health insurance coverage through MNsure. You may request to inspect or obtain copies of additional data held by MNsure pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13).

<a class="faqQuestion" rel="answer10" href="#">Costs for copies and data collection</a>
<div class="faqBlock" id="answer10" style="display: none;">
<a name="answer10"></a>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You may have to pay for copies of information that you request. MNsure may charge for time spent searching and retrieving when the request is by someone other than the subject of the data. Searching and retrieving is time spent identifying files, databases, or other storage devices (paper or electronic) to locate data or to determine whether data exist to respond to a request, and retrieving the relevant data. There is no charge to view or inspect data.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) Requests for paper copies are charged at $.25 per page for requests involving fewer than 100 pages. A two-sided paper copy counts as two copies.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(2) For data requests involving more than 100 pages or requests for electronic data, MNsure may charge the actual costs. Actual costs may include employee time (including time for searching and retrieving data and making copies), mailing costs, and costs for materials (paper, CDs, DVDs). There is no charge for separating private data from public data, and there is no requirement to create summary data from existing public data. For calculation of staff time costs in responding to the request, MNsure uses the following rates:</p>
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>Administrative staff: $15.88 per hour</li>
<li>Professional staff: $24.59 per hour</li>
<li>Technical staff: $32.42 per hour</li>
<li>Managerial staff: $34.21 per hour</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(3) MNsure does not charge for viewing or inspecting public records or private records by the data subject, searching and retrieving costs when the requestor is the data subject, or when providing data to another government agency or the Legislature in the normal course of business or for law enforcement purposes. A MNsure participant who requests copies of his or her own eligibility or enrollment information for purposes of pursuing an appeal should work with the MNsure Appeals Office. MNsure has discretion to waive copy costs.</p>

<a class="faqQuestion" rel="answer11" href="#">How long will it take to receive or inspect the information requested?</a>
<div class="faqBlock" id="answer11" style="display: none;">
<a name="answer11"></a>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you are the subject of the data requesting data about yourself, MNsure will respond immediately, if possible, or within 10 business days. For public data requests, MNsure generally responds to requests in the order received and within a reasonable time depending on the need for staff time to search and retrieve responsive public information as well as the size of the request.</p>
