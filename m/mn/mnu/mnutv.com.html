<section class="block" style="color: #7b8084;"><span style="color: #000000;">We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</span><span style="color: #000000;">We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold; color: #112233;" href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</span></a>&nbsp;for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</span><p></p>
