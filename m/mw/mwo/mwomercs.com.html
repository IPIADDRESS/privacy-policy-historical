                    <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
                    <h2>LAST MODIFIED:  October 25, 2011</h2>
                    
                    <p>This privacy policy (this “<b>Policy</b>”) describes Infinite Game Publishing Inc.’s (“<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>”, “<b>our</b>”) practices with respect to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information we collect from users of our IGP Offerings. All references to “<b>IGP Offerings</b>” in this Policy refer to <a href="http://www.infinitegamepublishing.com/" class="s5"> </a><a href="http://www.infinitegamepublishing.com/" class="s6">www.infinitegamepublishing.com</a>, or any of our online websites, products, offerings or services.</p>
                    
                    <p class="s4"><a href="http://www.mwomercs.com/" class="s8">www.mwomercs.com</a></p>
                    
                    <p>We may modify this Policy from time to time. When we post changes to this Policy, we will revise the “last modified” date at the top of this page. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to be informed of how we collect, use, protect and disclose your information. By accessing and/or using any IGP Offerings, you signify your understanding of, and agreement with, this Policy.  If you do not agree with our policies, please do not access any IGP Offerings.</p>
                    
                     1. <b>Introduction</b><span class="s2"> </span><br>
  We respect and uphold individual rights to privacy and the protection of personal information. We know how important it is to protect your personal information and want to make every customer experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. <span class="s4"> </span><br>
  The <i>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act </i>(Canada), or similar privacy legislation applicable in your Province if you live in Canada (“<b>Applicable Privacy Legislation</b>”) regulates the way private sector organizations operating in Canada may collect, use, keep, secure and  disclose  personal  information.     “<b>Personal  information</b>”  means  information  about  an identifiable individual, including, for example, an individual’s name, home address, telephone number, social insurance number, sex, income and family status. Personal information does not include information that would enable an individual to be contacted at a place of business, for example an employee’s name, position or title, business telephone number, or business address. We will only collect, use or disclose personal information in accordance with Applicable Privacy Legislation.<span class="s4"> </span><br>
  As required by Applicable Privacy Legislation, we have appointed a Privacy Officer who is responsible  for  compliance  with  this  Privacy  Policy  and  Applicable  Privacy  Legislation. Information on how to contact the Privacy Officer can be found below. <span class="s4"> </span><br>
  1. <b>Collection and Use of Personal Information</b><span class="s2"> </span><p></p>
<p class="s10">4816596.1</p>
<p>- 2 -<br>
  We collect two types of information through our IGP Offerings: personal information and non- personal information.    The types of  information we collect depend on  the nature of  your interaction with us.<br>
  a. <i><b>Personal information</b></i>—We may collect personal information such as:<br>
  i.         your  contact  information  –  e.g.,  name,  postal  address, telephone number, and email address;<br>
  ii.        your  personal  preferences  –  e.g.,  product   wish   lists, language preferences, and marketing consent, your account information, and information about your gameplay;<br>
  iii.       your IP address, and<br>
  iv.        your  transaction information –  e.g.,  products  purchased, method of payment, amount paid, and credit or debit card number.<br>
  b. <i><b>Non-personal information</b></i>—Non-personal information does not  identify you as an individual. For example:<br>
  i.         we may collect certain non-personal data when  you visit our IGP Offerings, such as the type of browser  you are using or the referring URL;<br>
  ii.        we may collect and summarize customer  information in a non-personal, aggregate format for  statistical and research purposes; or<br>
  iii.       we  may  collect  user  gameplay  statistics,  game   cheat tracking, and similar information with respect to our game- related IGP Offerings.<br>
  In most cases, you may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you  make  this  choice  we  may  not  be  able  to  provide  you  with  the  product,  service,  or information that you requested.   Certain types of personal information, such as your IP address, will be collected automatically when you access any IGP Offering.<br>
  1. <b>Use of Personal Information</b><br>
  We may use your personal information for a number of different business purposes, for example to:</p>
<p class="s10">4816596.1</p>
<p>- 3 -<br>
  a.         administer your accounts and fulfill your specific requests for  products, services or information;<br>
  b.         allow us to communicate with you and authenticate your identity;<br>
  c.         provide customer support to assist you with your questions or complaints;<br>
  d.         conduct surveys in order to improve our services;<br>
  e.         measure  and  improve  the  effectiveness  of  our  IGP  Offering  or  our marketing endeavours;<br>
  f.         detect and protect against fraud and error, and enforce our  agreements with you, including (without limitation) to process and collect payments and debts owed to us;<br>
  g.         track and analyze your purchases and preferences to better  understand your product and service needs and eligibility;<br>
  h.         to allow certain of our third party service providers, partners;<br>
  i.         to allow certain of our affiliates, third party service providers, partners and licensors to help us provide our services to you; and<br>
  j.         for other purposes as described in this Policy.<br>
  We limit the personal information we collect and use to that which is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified above.  Except as set out in this Policy, we will not collect, sell, distribute or use personal information for any other purposes without your further consent, as required by law or as authorized by Applicable Privacy Legislation.<br>
  1. <b>Your Consent</b><br>
  We will collect, use, or disclose your personal information only with your knowledge and consent, except where required or permitted by Applicable Privacy Legislation.    When you choose to provide us with your personal information you consent to the use of your personal information as identified in this Policy and as may be further identified at the time of collection.<br>
  a. <i><b>Express Consent</b></i>—Sometimes you will be asked to give your  express consent, such as by checking a box to indicate your consent to  receive marketing communications.<br>
  b. <i><b>Implied Consent</b></i>—Other times, we may obtain your consent  implicitly when we can reasonably conclude that you have given consent by some action  you  have  taken  or  an  action  you  have  decided  not  to  take.</p>
<p class="s10">4816596.1</p>
<p>- 4 -<br>
  Generally,  this  occurs  where  the  purpose  for  use  of  your  personal information would be reasonably apparent to you.<br>
  c. <i><b>Withdrawal of Consent</b></i>—You may notify us at any time that you wish to withdraw  or  change  your  consent  to  our  use  and  disclosure  or  your information.    We will accommodate your request subject to  legal and contractual restrictions related to your transactions. If you have “opted in” or subscribed to one of our publications, newsletters,  mailing  lists, or similar materials, we will always provide you the opportunity to "opt out" or unsubscribe.<br>
  1. <b>Information We may Collect Directly from You</b><br>
  Listed here are some further examples of the ways that we collect personal information directly from you and how we use it.<br>
  a. <i><b>Purchases, Returns and Exchanges</b></i>—For purchases, or if permitted with respect to any of our return policies for us to offer returns, we may ask for personal information such as your payment/credit card  information (for collecting and processing payments or refunds), IP  Address (for fraud detection purposes and recordkeeping purposes), and  your name, home address, billing address, and telephone number (for verification and fraud detection purposes).    You may also be asked to  produce photo ID for verification purposes only.   We may use a third party service to process payments and refunds.<br>
  b. <i><b>Purchase Follow-Up and Surveys</b></i>—Following a purchase or your use of the IGP Offerings, we may send you a follow-up communication to thank you for your business, or we may contact you to ensure that  you  are completely satisfied.  We may use contact information collected online or via telephone to conduct occasional surveys and other customer research. These  surveys  are  entirely  voluntary  and  you  may  easily  decline  to participate.<br>
  c. <i><b>Our  IGP  Offerings</b></i>—While  some  of  our  IGP  Offerings  can  be  used anonymously, in most cases (for example, to engage in most  features or functions of our IGP Offerings, or to order products and services from or through our IGP Offerings) you may be asked to provide certain personal information, such as:<br>
  i.         your first name, last name, e-mail address, postal address,</p>
<p class="s10">4816596.1</p>
<p>- 5 -<br>
  ii.        account information to log on to such IGP Offerings using an account connected to your personal information, such as answers to security questions, login history, account status,<br>
  iii.       support ticket(s) and statuses for customer service, in-game messages, forum posts and other content provided by you or sent to you by other users of the IGP Offerings.<br>
  Basically, this is the information we need to offer you the IGP Offerings.   We use this information  to  create  your  account,  contact  and  correspond  with  you  about  your purchases, respond to your inquiries, and monitor functions of our IGP Offerings that you choose to use, such as online forums.<br>
  a. <i><b>Sign-Up for Newsletters or Updates</b></i>—We also offer you the opportunity to sign up to receive newsletters, updates or similar communications from us from time to time<b>. </b>Should you choose to enrol  we will collect your contact information, such as name and email  address. This information will  only  be  used  to  send  you  such  communications  that  you  have requested.     You  may  “unsubscribe”  at  any  time  as  directed  in  such communications. We may offer you the ability to sign up for third parties’ newsletters, updates or similar  communications; the privacy policies of those parties will be provided  to  you at such time and their use of your personal information will be subject to those terms and conditions.<br>
  b. <i><b>Participate in a Contest or Promotion</b></i>—From time to time, we may run contests or promotions. If you participate, you may be asked for contact information  as  well  as  additional  optional  survey   information   (for example, product preferences). Personal information from contest entries will be used only to administer the contest and contact you if you win. For research and analysis purposes, we may also  summarize contest survey information in a manner that no longer identifies individual participants. All contests and promotions are subject  to this Policy and the rules that will be available with each particular campaign.   Some contests may be conducted by third parties and will be subject to the third party’s policies.<br>
  c. <i><b>Tell a Friend</b></i>—While visiting our IGP Offerings you may choose to use the “Tell a Friend” tool (or similar tool), which allows you to  inform a friend about products of interest to you.  The information you provide will be used to send a one-time email to your friend, inviting them to our Web Sites.  We will not add your friend to a mailing list and will not send them further email unless they choose to receive such communications from us. When using the “Tell a Friend” tool (or a similar tool) you are contacting your friend directly and as such you acknowledge that you are responsible for this correspondence and not  us.     If you provide us with personal</p>
<p class="s10">4816596.1</p>
<p>- 6 -<br>
  information  concerning  another  individual  (e.g.,  email  address),  you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from that  individual  to  enable  us  to  use  that  personal  information  for  the identified purpose.<br>
  d. <i><b>Call Centre</b></i>—We operate a customer support call centre to  accept and address your questions, concerns, or complaints.   When you contact our call centre, we may ask for personal information to help us  respond to your  inquiry or  to verify your  identity.    For  example, if  you  have a question about the status of a recent online order, we will ask for personal information to verify that you are the account holder.     We  may also monitor or record your telephone discussions with our  customer support representatives for training purposes and to ensure service quality.<br>
  e. <i><b>Social Networking Sites</b></i>—If you access one of our IGP  Offerings that connects to your social media accounts (collectively,  “<b>Social Media</b>”), IGP  may  receive  information  about  your  Social   Media  site  profile, including without limitation your first, last and user  names, and Social Media site profile ID and icon, in accordance with the terms of such Social Media site.   We may record information regarding the use of that Social Media connection, and we may collect other information that is visible on your Social Media page in accordance  with  the relevant terms of use associated with that social networking site.<br>
  1. <b>Information We Collect Automatically</b><br>
  In some cases, we automatically collect certain information.<br>
  a. <i><b>Our  Web  Sites</b></i>—When using  our  IGP  Offerings,  we  may  collect  the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP  address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access our IGP Offerings, the Internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to our IGP Offerings, the operating system or other system characteristics of the computing device you are using, the portions of the IGP Offerings you  visit, read or  view, and the content you  download from the IGP Offerings.      This  information  is  used  for  IGP  Offering  and  system administration purposes, and to improve the Web Sites, and to provide our services to you.<br>
  b. <i><b>Cookies</b></i>—The IGP Offerings consisting of websites may use “cookies”, a technology  that  installs  a  small  amount  of  information  on  a  user’s computer to permit the IGP Offering to recognize future visits using that computer and to track your use of our IGP Offerings. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the IGP Offering. For  example, the information</p>
<p class="s10">4816596.1</p>
<p>- 7 -<br>
  provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the IGP Offerings, to offer personalized content and information for your use, to track your activity at the IGP Offerings, to respond to your needs, and to otherwise facilitate your experience. You may choose to decline cookies from website IGP Offerings if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the IGP Offerings and your ability to access certain features of the IGP Offerings or engage in transactions through the IGP Offerings.<br>
  c. <i><b>Web Site Tracking Information</b></i>—With respect to our websites,  we may use web beacons or pixel tags to compile tracking information  reports regarding user demographics, traffic patterns, and purchases.  We may use a third party to conduct these functions (such as the “Google Analytics” offering).   We may then provide these reports to advertisers  and others. None of the tracking information in these reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users. For our own research  purposes,  we  may  link  tracking   information  with  personal information voluntarily provided by IGP Offering users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is  treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Policy<br>
  d. <i><b>Other   Information  Collected  Automatically—</b></i>We  may   receive  a confirmation when you open e-mail from us, if your  computer  supports such capabilities. The browser or client software that  you use to access IGP  Offerings   may   transmit  certain  geographic   information  and information regarding the capabilities or features of  your computer or software to us. We may also track other types of information, such as what games users download and install, any download errors, what games users purchase,  how  long  our  users  have  been   participating  in  any  IGP Offerings, the last time a user accessed a IGP Offering, user behaviour, gameplay, and whether a user has won any of  our games, sweepstakes, contests or other promotions featured on a IGP Offering.<br>
  e. <i><b>Supplementing Information</b></i>—From time  to  time  we  may  supplement information you give us with information from other  sources, such as information validating your address or other available  information you have  provided  us.  This  is  to  help  us  maintain  the  accuracy  of  the information we collect and to help us provide better service.<br>
  1. <b>Storage of Your Information</b><br>
  Infinite Game Publishing may process and store your information in Canada or the United States, and therefore Canadian governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies (or, by treaty, foreign countries) may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through Canadian</p>
<p class="s10">4816596.1</p>
<p>- 8 -<br>
  laws. By consenting to the information practices set out in this Policy, you specifically consent to your information being processed and stored in Canada or the United States.<br>
  Without limiting our obligations under Section 9 below, please note that the IGP Offerings necessarily involve the use of the Internet and other public and private networks, all of which are outside of IGP’s control.  Transmissions over the Internet or such networks may be intercepted by other parties or stored, cached, routed, transmitted or received in jurisdictions outside of Canada or the United States.  Data, messages, information or materials sent over the Internet or such networks may not be completely private, and your anonymity on the Internet is never guaranteed.  As we ourselves will be careful with your information, we ask that you also please be careful with the information you provide through IGP Offerings (for example, by limiting the public display of personally identifiable information, or by using difficult passwords that you change from time to time).<br>
  1. <b>Disclosure and Sharing of Your Information</b><br>
  We do not sell or license your personal information to any other party.  However, in the normal course of business we may share some of your personal information with our affiliates and partners, and with third parties acting on our behalf or as permitted or required by Applicable Privacy Legislation.<br>
  a. <i><b>Service  Providers</b></i>—We  may  use  third  party  service   providers   ((for example, web hosting providers and/or payment  processers) to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handing of personal information. When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. Some of these operations may result in personal information collected by us being stored or processed in the Canada and United States and, as a result, your personal information may be accessible to law enforcement and regulatory authorities in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act and other applicable laws of the United States, as well as Canadian laws.<br>
  b. <i><b>Information Shared Amongst Our Affiliates, Subsidiaries and Divisions</b></i><br>
  —We may share personal information gathered on our Web Sites with and amongst  our  corporate  subsidiaries,  affiliates  or  divisions  for  internal business purposes in accordance with this Policy.  If we do, we will ensure that your information continues to be used only in accordance with this Policy and your expressed choices.<br>
  c. <i><b>Business  Transfers</b></i>—As  we  continue  to  grow,  we  might  sell  or  buy certain subsidiaries and/or business units. In such transactions,  customer information is generally one of the transferred assets, but  would  remain subject to the protections described in this Policy (unless  you consent</p>
<p class="s10">4816596.1</p>
<p>- 9 -<br>
  otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired by another party, customer information would in most cases  be  one  of  the  transferred assets. Any  such  transfers  will  be  in accordance with applicable laws.<br>
  d. <i><b>Legal Disclosure</b></i>—We may disclose your information as  permitted or required  by  law.  For  example,  we  may  be  compelled   to  release information by a court of law or other person or entity with jurisdiction to compel production of such information.  If we have reasonable grounds to believe information could be useful in the  investigation of improper or unlawful  activity,  we  may  disclose   information  to  law  enforcement agencies or other appropriate investigative bodies.<br>
  e. <i><b>Protection of Us or Others</b></i>—We may disclose your information if there is a violation of the any agreements between us and you (such as, without limitation,  any  Terms  of  Use,  User  Agreements,  End  User   License Agreements); if  we  have a  good  faith belief that the law  requires or authorizes it; or if needed to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our customers or others. This includes exchanging  information with entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br>
  1. <b>Security of Personal Information</b><br>
  The security of your personal information is a high priority for us. We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your personal information, whether recorded on paper or captured electronically, against unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.    For example, electronic records are stored in secure, limited-access servers; we employ technological tools like firewalls and passwords; and we ensure our employees are trained on the importance of maintaining the security and confidentiality of personal information. Reasonably secure methods are used whenever we destroy personal information.<br>
  a. <i><b>Forums,  Chats  and  Messaging</b></i>—IGP  Offerings  may  operate  forums, message  boards  or  chat  areas  where  users  can  exchange  ideas  and communicate with each other. When posting to a message board or chat area,  the  information  is  being  made  publicly  available  in  an  online environment. Any  information posted  is  the  sole  responsibility of  the individual user.<br>
  b. <i><b>Links to Other websites</b></i>—Our IGP Offerings may contain links to other websites,  products, services, offerings  or  Internet resources  which  are provided solely for your convenience and information. When you follow one of those external links, you are contacting another resource. We have no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal  information.    We</p>
<p class="s10">4816596.1</p>
<p>- 10 -<br>
  encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other offerings to learn how they collect and use your personal information.<br>
  c. <i><b>Children</b></i>—We do not offer products for purchase by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are under<br>
  13, you may use and access the IGP Offerings only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.  IGP respects the privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with applicable legislation. If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to us, he or she can contact the Privacy Officer (See below). We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of  13.  We  recognize  the  importance  of  safeguarding  the  privacy  of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly.<br>
  1. <b>Requests for Access to and Correction of Personal Information</b><br>
  Applicable Privacy Legislation allows any individual the right to access and/or request the correction of errors or omissions in his or her personal information that is in our custody or under our control. Our Privacy Officer will assist the individual with the access request. This includes:<br>
  a.         identification of personal information under our custody or control;<br>
  b.         information about how personal information under our control may be or has been used by us; and<br>
  c.         the names of any individuals and organizations to which the individual’s personal information has been disclosed.<br>
  We will respond to requests within the time allowed by Applicable Privacy Legislation and will make every effort to respond as accurately and completely as possible. Any corrections made to personal information will be promptly sent to any organization it was disclosed to.<br>
  In certain exceptional circumstances, we may not be able to provide access to certain personal information we holds about an individual. If access cannot be provided, we will notify the individual making the request within 30 days, in writing, of the reasons for the refusal.<br>
  1. <b>Removal of Your Information</b><br>
  We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and to meet any legal requirements. Personal information used to make a decision that directly affects an individual will be kept for at least one year after such a decision. We have retention standards</p>
<p class="s10">4816596.1</p>
<p>- 11 -<br>
  that meet these parameters. We destroy your information when it is no longer needed or required to be kept, or we remove your personally identifiable information to render it anonymous.<br>
  1. <b>Concerns or Questions regarding our Compliance</b><br>
  Questions or concerns regarding our compliance with this Policy may be directed to the Privacy<br>
  Officer:<br>
