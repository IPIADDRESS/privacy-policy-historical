Because protecting your privacy is very important to 3M, we have adopted the following policies to safeguard your personal information and are committed to protecting its confidentiality. We will limit the collection and use of personal information to what is necessary to administer our business, provide you with the highest quality service, and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest. <i>We will not disclose any individual information to other organizations.</i></p>
<p>
The 3M Innovation Network may contain links to other sites, and we make every effort to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.</p>
<p>
<b>A. Basic Statement:</b><br>
3M collects personal information from our visitors on a <i>voluntary</i> basis only. Personal information may include name, title, company, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc. The individual information we collect is used only by 3M to process orders which have been placed by our customers; or for marketing our products, events and/or services. <i>We do not sell, rent or transmit personal information to other organizations.</i></p>
<p>
<b>B. Collection and Use:</b><br>
Our web server tracks and collects general information about the visits to our website. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily numbers of visitors to our site, the daily requests we receive for particular files, the types of browsers visitors use, the visitors' domain names, and what countries those requests come from.</p>
<p>
The data you voluntarily provide helps us to customize our website to better meet your needs, therefore we may request and store the following types of specific information: your name, company name, street address, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. 3M may also retain electronic communications you send to our customer service representatives or webmaster.  These may be shared only within 3M as a means to continually improve customer service.</p>
<p>
<b>C. Storage and Access:</b><br>
All personal information you provide to 3M is secured on our server with restricted access. 3M reserves the right to use agents, who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage and processing functions. Only designated employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate business functions are permitted to view your personal data. Employees or agents who violate 3M's privacy policies are subject to disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.</p>
<p>
<b>D. Disclosure:</b><br>
Because 3M considers the individual information we maintain to be confidential, our policy is to disclose no personal information to third parties unless release is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings.<br><br> </p>
