				<p><span class="Header">Privacy</span> 
				</p><p><span class="subHeader">Importance of Managing Consumer Privacy</span> 
				</p>
				<p>Most established ad sellers and marketers recognize this growing 
				  concern, and the realization that their brands will suffer if 
				  consumers believe their privacy is being violated. In the wireless 
				  space, consumers are even more sensitive since devices are more 
				  personal and travel with the consumer. </p>
				<p>The failure to respond effectively to privacy issues and risks 
				  can result in adverse consequences that range from outright 
				  market rejection to regulatory enforcement action, to loss of 
				  data flow, or to costly litigation. The MMA, in furtherance 
				  of its mission to promote Mobile Advertising and Commerce has 
				  taken a proactive stance in establishing the MMA Privacy Guidelines 
				  for member organizations that set minimum acceptable standards 
				  for protecting the privacy of online users. These standards 
				  will serve as guidelines by which MMA member organizations can 
				  establish individual privacy policies while ensuring the privacy 
				  of users is uniformly protected. </p>
				<p>In addition to establishing guidelines for wireless marketers, 
				  the MMA follows a strict policy for any information submitted 
				  on the MMA website, addressed below. </p>
				<p><b>Information Collection and Usage</b><br>
				  The MMA only collects personal information from site visitors 
				  on a voluntary basis. This information may include: </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>first and last name 
				  </li><li>title 
				  </li><li>company name 
				  </li><li>company address 
				  </li><li>phone and/or fax number 
				  </li><li>e-mail address 
				  </li><li>credit card information (e.g., type, #, expiration) </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The personal information that MMA collects is used by the MMA 
				  to process orders that have been placed by individuals through 
				  registrations or product inquiries. All personal information 
				  collected via the MMA Website will only be used for its intended 
				  purpose. If there is a change in use of such information, notification 
				  will be explicitly stated within the contents of the Website. 
				  All marketing efforts undertaken by the MMA are targeted to 
				  a business audience (i.e., not consumers nor children). The 
				  MMA complies with the ChildrenÂ¹s Online Privacy Protection Act 
				  (COPPA) and does not knowingly collect personal identifiable 
				  information from anyone under the age of 13. This requirement 
				  will be posted wherever the MMA collects data within the MMA 
				  site, including registration. The MMA does not collect highly 
				  sensitive data (e.g., medical or personal financial information), 
				  other than credit card number as listed above, which is used 
				  to process orders or registrations. </p>
				<p>Individuals must affirmatively request to join and remain on 
				  our e-mail lists by contacting MMA staff at membership@MMAglobal.com. 
				  The MMA does not compile, buy, sell, rent or trade consumer 
				  mailing lists. Other information volunteered by the customer 
				  via site registration, for example, may be used for future marketing 
				  and educational efforts (e.g., relevant industry events, MMA 
				  co-sponsored events, educational programs, relevant industry 
				  information, MMA specific products) to that individual. </p>
				<p><b>User Access</b><br>
				  The MMA is committed to providing reasonable and practical access 
				  to allow visitors to identify inaccuracies in their personal 
				  information. Each user has the right of access to personal data 
				  they have submitted through the MMA Website. Visitors may submit 
				  inquires about the accuracy of personally identifiable information 
				  they have previously submitted through the MMA Website; visitors 
				  may also request to have information removed. When practical, 
				  the MMA will, upon request, modify or delete personally identifying 
				  information. </p>
				<p>If you would like to add your name, check and/or correct your 
				  information, or remove your name from the MMA mailing list, 
				  e-mail us at <a href="mailto:membership@MMAglobal.com">membership@MMAglobal.com</a>. 
				  or write to us at the address below. </p>
				<p><b>Third Party Distribution</b><br>
				  Personal information provided to the MMA generally will not 
				  be disseminated to third parties. However, event registration 
				  information (e.g., first and last name, title, email address, 
				  company name and address) may be provided to event sponsors 
				  for a one-time use only. If you do not wish to receive communication 
				  from a third-party sponsor of a MMA event or other program, 
				  please inform the MMA by e-mail at <a href="mailto:membership@MMAglobal.com">membership@MMAglobal.com</a>, 
				  calling or writing to the MMA at the address below. Personal 
				  information collected by the MMA is stored in our database for 
				  a reasonable time period with which information remains current, 
				  and is updated periodically. The MMA may divulge information 
				  as necessary to comply with state and federal laws (e.g., subpoenas, 
				  search warrants, etc). </p>
				<p><b>Use of Cookies and Log Files</b><br>
				  The MMA reserves the right to analyze its Web site logs in an 
				  effort to improve the value of its site (e.g., improve the content 
				  and support services on the MMA site, and to update our records). 
				  However, the log files are not personally identifiable and MMA 
				  makes no attempt to link site logs with individuals that pass 
				  through the MMA site. Only authorized MMA staff have access 
				  to MMA site information. The MMA does not use cookies on its 
				  site. The MMA does not supplement user information with aggregate 
				  data. </p>
				<p><b>Data Security</b><br>
				  The security of the information you provide to the MMA is important 
				  to us. Registration forms which capture certain information, 
				  including credit card transactions, are secured through 128 
				  bit SSL encryption with a registered Verisign SSL certificate. 
				  Information is stored in a secure area and only accessible by 
				  authorized MMA staff. However, the MMA site includes links to 
				  other sites, and when you choose to visit those sites, the MMA 
				  cannot assume responsibility for any other siteÂ¹s content or 
				  information handling practices. We encourage you to review each 
				  siteÂ¹s privacy policy prior to entering into transactions with 
				  the third-party linked sites. </p>
				<p><b>Trans-Border Data</b><br>
				  The MMA is taking reasonable steps to ensure compliance with 
				  the U.S. Department of Commerce International "Safe Harbor" 
				  Principles, including maintaining adequate privacy protection 
				  of transfer of personal data from EU member states. </p>
				<p><b>Third-Party Verification</b><br>
				  To maintain compliance with MMA Privacy Guidelines, the MMA 
				  will undergo a privacy audit conducted by an independent third 
				  party on a regular basis. The audit opinion and the period to 
				  which the opinion covers will be clearly posted on the MMA site. 
				</p>

				  We can be reached via e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@mmaglobal.com">info@mmaglobal.com</a> or <a href="mailto:membership@mmaglobal.com">membership@mmaglobal.com</a>
