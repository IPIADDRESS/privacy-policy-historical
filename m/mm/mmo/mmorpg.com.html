		<h1>Rules of Conduct</h1>
		<h2>Terms of Use</h2>
		<p>MMORPG.COM (a Web site operated wholly by Cyber Creations Inc.) provides this site as a resource for the MMORPG community. Forum posts can be deleted and users may be banned from this site, without prior warning or explanation, at the sole discretion of Cyber Creations Inc.</p>
		<p>You must be <u>at least 13 years</u> of age to use this Web site.  Persons under the age of 13 <strong>MUST</strong> obtain a parent's or guardian's permission prior to using this Web site.</p>
		<h2>Forums / Chat / Messaging Rules</h2>
		<h3>Our Goal</h3>
		<p>We have not set out to limit people's freedom of speech or discussion. These rules simply strive to keep the boards on topic, productive and inclusive for all members. Accidental violation of minor rules will not result in strict penalties. We want our users to enjoy our boards and feel that these rules will ensure that everyone can equally.</p>
		<h3>Minor Infractions</h3>
		<p>Committing Minor Infractions at MMORPG.com will result in a first warning, followed by temporary bans. If the issue becomes chronic, a permanent ban will be considered.</p>
		<p class="note">* For purposes of our rules, we will work under a 3 strikes policy. A first offense results in a warning. A second offence results in a 1 to 14 day ban and a third offence results in a lengthy and possibly permanent ban. Warnings and bans remain active for these purposes for 6 months.  Note that severe offenses may receive stronger action, even on first or second offenses.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Language Policy
				<ul>
					<li>MMORPG.com wishes to create the friendliest atmosphere possible in our forums and on our site. As such, excessive use of strong language will not be tolerated. Ex: The odd "bad word" is fine. A profanity laced rant, on the other hand, is not. Discretion will rest with the moderators.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Topic Hijacking
				<ul>
					<li>Posting comments within a thread which severely disrupts the original conversation is prohibited at MMORPG.com.<br>
					<em>Example: Asking whether a game has PvP in a thread about crafting materials found in a new expansion is Topic Hijacking.</em></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Flaming and Personal Attacks
				<ul>
					<li>o	MMORPG.com does not tolerate personal attacks on other posters.  Please keep your arguments and posts on topic, and argue the ideas and topics of the thread instead of insulting other users.<br>
					<em>Example: Telling someone that you disagree with their argument is tolerated, while calling someone inappropriate names is not.</em></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Game Attacks
				<ul>
					<li>Unsubstantiated comments about specific or general games will be penalized in nearly the same way attacks against people will. The exception is that you can say mean things about games provided you back it up with reasons.<br>
					<em>Example: "Game X sucks." is not a legitimate comment. "Game X sucks, because..." is acceptable.</em></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Spamming "Post Report" Tool
				<ul>
					<li>We encourage users to report posts that they feel violate these rules, but if you spam or abuse the report tool, penalties will apply.<br>
					<em>Example: Reporting a post we do not take action is not against the rules. Reporting the same post dozens of times, is.</em></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Using the Post Report Tool as a Method of Contacting the Moderators
				<ul>
					<li>The post report tool is not intended to be used as a way for users to communicate with Moderators. If you have an issue with a warning or ban, please email <a href="mailTo:community@mmorpg.com">community@mmorpg.com</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Referral Links
				<ul>
					<li>MMORPG.com does not support its members posting links for which they are entitled to reward. This constitutes advertising on the forums. If you wish to purchase advertising with us, please contact admin@mmorpg.com.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Trolling
				<ul>
					<li>Posting excessive negative comments or baiting others to respond in a negative manner is considered trolling on the MMORPG.com forums.<br>
					<em>For example: If there is one game that you did not enjoy, voicing your opinion is encouraged. Posting this opinion in every thread concerning that game to the point that it disrupts all other conversation is not tolerated.</em></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Copyright and Press Material
				<ul>
					<li>Reposting material in its entirety from other sources is against our rules. Quotations from things such as news articles are fine, provided it is cited and (if possible) linked to. We ask others to respect our content and ask our readers do the same for other people's content.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>NDAs
				<ul>
					<li>MMORPG.com does not permit users to post information on games still under an NDA.  For more information about your specific game's NDA, please visit their official website.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Off-Topic Posting
				<ul>
					<li>Posting in boards that clearly have nothing to do with your topic is not tolerated. Typically, posts of this nature will be moved to the appropriate board.<br>
					<em>Example: A post in the EverQuest II boards about how much you love World of WarCraft is off topic.</em></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Virtual Trading
				<ul>
					<li>MMORPG.com does not allow the purchase, sale, or trade of in-game assets, accounts, or powerleveling services.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Individual Forum Rules

				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
