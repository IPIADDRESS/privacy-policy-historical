MocoSpace also requests location based information from your mobile device in order to customize your experience and the advertising that you see while on the site.
<br>
<br>

MocoSpace may also collect non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site.

Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join MocoSpace, to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on MocoSpace with each other through the MocoSpace service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members.

<br>

We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their "notification" setting in the user profile.

<br>

From time to time, MocoSpace or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on MocoSpace. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We use this information to notify winners and deliver their prizes to them.

In some instances we may need to share your personal information with third parties in order to complete the sweepstake or contest, if we do so you will be able to make an informed decision as to whether or not you wish to have your personal information shared with these third parties.
<br>
<br>

<b>Import Contacts</b>
<br>
<br>

We utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and/ or other members. We make it easy for you to invite people from your address books to join you on our Site. At your request we will search your address book to help you import your contacts to our site. You will then have an opportunity to add any users as a friend if they are already on MocoSpace or to send them an invitation to join MocoSpace if they are not already members. You can select which of your contacts you allow MocoSpace to contact with checkboxes. All boxes are checked initially but you can deselect any or all of the contacts in your list. Any contacts you select will be sent an invitation that originates from MocoSpace but informs the contact that you were the member who initiated the invitation. If the contact does not respond to the invitation, a single follow-up reminder will be sent 7 days after the initial invitation. The purpose of the invitation is to allow your contacts to join MocoSpace. It is also possible to send an invitation by entering a contacts phone number. When a phone number is entered, the contact is sent an SMS message that is marked as from MocoSpace via your user name. The contact is asked to join MocoSpace.
<br>
<br>

These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name, email address, photos, posts to your wall, and profile information to pre-populate our sign up form and allow you to post photos to your MocoSpace profile. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time For any additional information about the security measures we use on MocoSpace, please contact us at support@mocospace.com.
<br>
<br>

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

<br>
<br>

MocoSpace reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of MocoSpace or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
<br>
<br>

<b>Agents/Service Providers</b>

We may share your name, email address and credit card information as necessary for the third party to provide that service.
<br>
<br>
