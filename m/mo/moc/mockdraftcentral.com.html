The information we collect about you is used to provide you with a more personalized and richer experience while visiting our network of web sites, including RotoWire.com, Databasesports.com and CoverWire.com (the "Roto Sports, Inc.

                            <div class="heading size-4 bold">WHAT INFORMATION DOES ROTOWIRE COLLECT?</div>

                            <p><em>Personal Information</em></p>
                            <p>You may visit and use many features on the Roto Sports, Inc. Network without completing any registration at all. However, in order to order products, complete surveys, enter contests and sweepstakes, participate in polls, online chats and forums, or enter other enhanced, member areas of the Roto Sports, Inc.

When you become a registered member, we require you to provide us with your contact information (including your name and email address) and date of birth, as well as to create a password.  As our goal is to make your experience as easy and enjoyable as possible throughout the entire Roto Sports, Inc.

                            <p><em>Credit Card Information</em></p>
                            <p>If you purchase a subscription to RotoWire.com or any products on the site, you will additionally need to provide us with your credit card and shipping information, or you have the right to send us a check.</p>
                            <p><em>Internet Cookies</em></p>
                            <p>You should be aware that information and data may be automatically collected through the use of Cookies. "Cookies" are small text files that store basic information that a web site can use to recognise repeat site visits and as an example, re-call your name if this has been previously supplied. We may use this to observe behaviour and compile aggregate data in order to improve the Site, target the advertising and assess general effectiveness of such advertising.</p>
                            <p>Cookies do not attach to your system and damage your files. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature.</p>
                            <p>However, a full subscription to RotoWire.com requires that your browser enable cookies or your access to the site likely won't work.</p>
                            <p>In addition, some of the third-party advertisers and ad networks we run on our sites use cookies. Information on how to opt out of those cookies is below.</p>

                            <div class="heading size-4 bold">HOW DOES ROTO SPORTS, INC. USE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS? </div>

                            <p>Subject to your express opt-in approval, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties, including telemarketers and e-commerce partners, who assist Roto Sports, Inc. by providing services to users of the Roto Sports, Inc.

                            <p>Should you change your mind about the information you've provided to us or should your information change, we have provided a way for you to correct, update or remove the personal information you gave us. You can do this simply by contacting us in any of the simple ways set forth below in the section entitled " How do you opt out? How do you change the information we have for you?"</p>
                            <div class="heading size-4 bold">HOW DO WE PROTECT CUSTOMER INFORMATION?</div>
                            <p>We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your personal information on our systems. Member personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems.</p>
                            <p>To ensure compliance with updated security technology, we recommend using one of the following browsers, each of which can be downloaded free of charge: Mozilla Firefox (http://www.firefox.com), or Microsoft Internet Explorer (http://www.microsoft.com/ie).  To ensure the highest level of security available today, we suggest that you choose the 128-bit encryption version from the download options.  If you do not have access to a browser that supports at least 48-bit encryption, your information may not be processed by our servers, or may not be securely transferred through your web browser to our servers.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, when you submit information to us (or to any other web site) over the Internet, the information may travel over many networks and systems that are not under our control and, during such time, can be intercepted.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Roto Sports, Inc. can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.  Further, anything you voluntarily provide in any public area of the Internet, including on the Roto Sports, Inc. Network, will be publicly available to other visitors on that web site and potentially to other third parties, and you should always exercise caution when deciding to publicly disclose any of your personal information.</p>

                            <div class="heading size-4 bold">HOW DO YOU COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE?? </div>

                            <p>Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not collect personal identifiable information from children under thirteen years of age without the consent of a parent or legal guardian.  Thus, when a guest under 13 years of age registers, he/she is required to provide the email address of his/her parent (or legal guardian).  We then contact the parent (or legal guardian) and alert them to the child's registration.  We require the parent or guardian to validate the account in order for the potential member to become a registered member.  However, even after an account has been validated, no personally identifiable information collected from guests under the age of thirteen will ever be sold or provided to any third parties, or used for any marketing or promotional purposes.  In addition, parents may request to review the personally identifiable information collected from their child, may ask to have that information deleted, and may refuse to allow further collection or use of their child's personally identifiable information at any time. To request such review or to give instructions regarding the personally identifiable information we have collected about a child, parents/legal guardians should contact us in one of the ways mentioned above in the section entitled "How do you opt out? How do you change the information we have for you?" or in the section below entitled "Questions? Contact Us."</p>
