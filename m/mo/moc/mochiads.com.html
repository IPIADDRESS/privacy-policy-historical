                  <p>
                  	Mochi Media, Inc. (the “Mochi Media”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy
                    seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting Mochi Media’s websites at http://www.mochimedia.com,
                    http://www.mochiads.com, http://www.mochibot.com, http://www.mochikit.com (the “Websites”), or using any of our services, you acknowledge
                    that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
                  </p>
				<h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
				<p>
					This Privacy Policy covers Mochi Media’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Mochi Media gathers
                    when you are accessing the Websites and when you use our services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Mochi Media
                    does not own or control, or to individuals that Mochi Media does not employ or manage.
				</p>
				<h3>What Personal Information Does Mochi Media display or Collect?</h3>
				<p>
					The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and
                    profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Websites. In connection with the Websites, we request and display some
                    personal information to other users and visitors of the Websites, which allows users to identify each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					We collect the following types of information from our users.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h4>
						<p>
							We receive and store any information you enter on the Websites or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information
                            collected include your name, age, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, and payment information . You may choose not to provide
                            us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information
                            you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the
                            advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove any of your
                            personal information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and account information.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h4>
						<p>
							We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Websites or obtain services from us. Mochi Media
                            automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Mochi Media cookie
                            information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your transactions on the Websites.
						</p>
						<p>
							Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its
                            components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Mochi Media only uses this data in
                            aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate
                            data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Websites or services so that we can make the Websites appealing to as
                            many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our
                            partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also
                            understand how often people use their services and the Websites, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online
                            experience. Again, Mochi Media never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>E-mail Communications:</h4>
						<p>
							We often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Mochi Media if your computer supports this type of program. Mochi Media
                            uses this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from
                            other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.
						</p>						
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>What About Cookies?</h4>
						<p>
							Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to
                            recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Mochi Media cookies do not
                            collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal
                            Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well
                            as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety
                            of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some
                            of the Websites’s most attractive features.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ads appearing on the Websites may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad
                            server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use
                            your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be
                            of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Mochi Media and does not cover the use of cookies by any
                            advertisers.
