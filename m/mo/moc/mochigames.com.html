	<h3>MochiGames Privacy Policy</h3>	
		<p>
		    Mochi Media, Inc. (“Mochi”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn
            more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting Mochi’s MochiGames website at <a href="/">http://www.mochigames.com</a>, (the “Website”), or using any of our services offered through the Website
            (including but not limited to MochiCoins), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h4>
		<p>
		    This Privacy Policy covers Mochi’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Mochi gathers when you are accessing the Website and when you
            use our services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Mochi does not own or control, or to individuals that Mochi does not employ or manage.
		</p><p>
			
		</p><h4>What Personal Information Does MochiGames display or Collect?</h4>
		<p>
		    The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to
            interact with other users through the Website. In connection with the Website, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of the Website,
            which allows users to identify each other.
		</p>
		
		<p>We collect the following types of information from our users.</p>
		
		<h4>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h4>
		<p>
		    We receive and store any information you enter on the Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include:
		</p>		
		<ul>
		    <li>
		        Profile: Username; email; password; gender; birthday; some email settings; avatar pic; 
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        Your Social Networking Information: information collected from social networks to which you belong (e.g. Facebook; Twitter; etc.) in accordance with your providing us with your credentials and permission; or information posted to any such social networks through your MochiGames account. 
		    </li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide
            is used for such purposes as keeping a high score record, responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content
            you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove any of your personal information at any time by logging into your account and
            accessing features to edit your profile and account information.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h4>
		<p>
			We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or obtain services from us, including, but not limited to the following:  
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Game playing data: While you are logged into your MochiGames account, we keep track of the games you play; when you played them; the sites where you played them; and
                general game activity including in-game communications.
			</li>
			<li>
				MochiCoins and Wallet: We collect billing information in order to fund your MochiGames Wallet and we record your MochiCoins transactions.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Mochi automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Mochi cookie information, and the page you requested. We
            also record the details of your transactions on the Website.
		</p>
		<p>
			Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that
            indicate how many people watched a particular show. Mochi only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you
            personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Website so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as
            possible. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of
            statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and the Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online
            experience. Again, Mochi never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
		</p>

		<h4>E-mail Communications:</h4>
		<p>
		    We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Mochi if your computer supports this type of program. Mochi uses this confirmation to help us make e-mails more
            interesting and helpful.
		</p>
				
		<h4>What About Cookies?</h4>
		<ul>
		    <li>
		        Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how
                and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Mochi cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected
                through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication
                of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated,
                however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Website’s most attractive features.
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer
                each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other
                things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Mochi and does not cover the
                use of cookies by any advertisers.
		    </li>
		</ul>
