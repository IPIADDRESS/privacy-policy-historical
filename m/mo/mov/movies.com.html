What are cookies?  Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site
transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while 
at the site. Cookies make Web-surfing easier by saving your passwords,
purchases, and preferences for you. The use of cookies is an industry
standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites. 

</p><p>
Buena Vista Online does not use information transferred through cookies for any
promotional or marketing purposes, nor is the information shared with any third
parties whatsoever. Buena Vista Online does not use cookies to identify individuals or to
retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.

</p><p>
Cookies help make movies.com better, by showing how and when guests use
the site. They do not, however, track who uses the site. Many content
improvements and updates are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages
viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies.

</p><p>
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are
sent from third-party computers and are subject to the above-stated
policies. 

</p><p>
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you'd prefer, you
can set yours to refuse cookies.  However, it is possible that some areas of the
site will not function properly if you do so.

</p><p>
Buena Vista Online reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying guests of the existence of a new privacy policy. You can send <a href="Mail/index.html">e-mail</a> to us with any further questions.
