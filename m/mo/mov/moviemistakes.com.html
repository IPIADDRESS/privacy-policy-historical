<p class="header">GORILLA NATION MEDIA'S COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</p>

<p class="text">GNM is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering consumer confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. We invite all users to contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@gorillanation.com">legal@gorillanation.com</a> 
with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p class="text">•<b> What GNM Does</b> <br>
Gorilla Nation Media operates the following interrelated business lines; more information on each may be found at www.gorillanation.com:<br>
Ad Network - Gorilla Nation Media represents a network of Web sites for which it sells and serves online advertisements on behalf of advertiser clients.</p>
<p class="text">•<b> GNM Promotions</b> - GNM's Promotions division develops customized online promotions campaigns such as sweepstakes and other incentive-style marketing campaigns.</p>
<p class="text">•<b> GNM Mail</b> - GNM Mail assists Web publishers in sending marketing and promotional email messages to online users that have consented to receive promotional email messages. For more information about GNM Mail, contact <a href="mailto:info@gorillanation.com">info@gorillanation.com</a>. </p>
<p class="text">• <b>AD Management Solutions</b> - GNM's ad management solutions provide advertisers and publishers with a suite of ad serving solutions.</p>
<p class="text"><b>How GNM's Products and Services Enhance User Privacy and Protect the Property of Advertisers and Web Publishers</b></p>
<p class="text">The Gorilla Nation Media Network serves ads to its partner Web sites. The cookies that are employed on the Network serve a quantitative function and are not designed to collect and store data profiles on users. They are used to:</p>
<p class="text">• Report to GNM's advertiser and Web site clients the estimated total reach of an ad campaign;<br>
• Report the frequency with which an ad was shown to a user, and other measurement statistics;<br>
• Ensure that an advertisement displayed to a user corresponds to the correct click-through destination;<br>
• Deliver a series of advertisements in the proper sequence; and<br>
• Limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement.</p>
<p class="text">Unlike other global ad serving companies, Gorilla Nation Media does not use any of the data collected via cookies for purposes other than those described above. Gorilla Nation Media does not merge personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information, and does not otherwise parse, sort, gather, or aggregate user data for use elsewhere. Non-PII is collected by Gorilla Nation Media through session cookies that terminate when the browser is closed.</p>
<p class="text">Gorilla Nation Media thus has no reason to offer users the choice to "opt-out" of anything that pertains to Network served ads.</p>
<p class="text"><b>What User Information Is Collected by Email and Promotions</b><br>
Gorilla Nation Media collects two types personally identifiable information only through its Email and Promotions business lines.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Personally Identifiable Information ("PII")</b> 
<br>
PII is personal information classified as personal to the online consumer, such as name, address, phone number and email address. PII also includes other personal information such as birth-date, zip code, gender, or lifestyle information.</p>
<p class="text">• GNM Real Media's Email and Promotions divisions collect PII on an opt-in basis only. Gorilla Nation Media will not collect any PII unless that user voluntarily provides it to GNM. If you do not want your personal information collected online, please do not submit it to surveys, promotions, sweepstakes, or subscriptions.<br>
•PII is collected by Gorilla Nation Media when online users respond to a survey and provide it, when they register for an email newsletter, register for a product or service online, or enter a sweepstakes promoted by GNM, its subsidiaries or its partners. Selected partners of Gorilla Nation Media will share information with Gorilla Nation Media about only their online consumers who have consented to the sharing of their information 
with third parties.</p>
<p class="text">Furthermore, each individual in the GNM Email database has answered positively to an "opt in" question, or they have voluntarily filled out an Internet survey card to receive email solicitation about products of interest. Gorilla Nation Media and its partners communicate with these users frequently to verify their "opt in" status. Gorilla Nation Media also provides users with an explicit opportunity to opt-out every time an email promotion is sent.</p>
<p class="text">In all instances, prior to providing PII information 
to GNM's Email or Promotions divisions, each online user is given meaningful notice regarding the collection practice and a choice regarding the dissemination of such information. All users are informed about how Gorilla Nation Media and its partners may use such information, including whether it will be shared with marketing partners or combined with other information available to GNM. Users will always be offered the choice not to provide PII or not to have such PII shared with others. Gorilla Nation Media will not share this PII information with any partner company if the user indicates on the registration form the preference to limit the use of such information.</p>
<p class="text">Gorilla Nation Media does not collect personal medical information or credit information, or information related to children, except in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
<p class="text"><b>How Gorilla Nation Media Uses Collected Information</b><br>
Personally Identifiable Information (PII). PII is used by Gorilla Nation Media in several ways, as follows:</p>
<p class="text">• GNM Real Media's Promotions and Email divisions use the PII to deliver permission-based direct marketing messages based on a user's expressed interests.<br>
• If an online user voluntarily submits its email address to GNM, or one of its partners, online, he or she may receive periodic emails from Gorilla Nation Media with information on new services or products being offered by our company or by one of our partners.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Opting Out From GNM'S List of Permissioned Email Addresses</b><br>

      Gorilla Nation Media shares the collected information

      does not sell or transfer the ownership of its 
      PII or Non-PII. Gorilla Nation Media provides 
      its partners only with access to such information 
      on a limited basis. Before any access is shared 
      with a partner, Gorilla Nation Media ensures that 
      such partner publishes and adheres to strict privacy 
      principles regarding the use of such information. 
      Any such use is disclosed to the online user at 
      the time such user submits information.</p>
    <p class="text"><b>Personally Identifiable Information 
      (PII)</b> - in cases where an online consumer 
      has consented to have their information shared 
      with third parties, Gorilla Nation Media will 
      make access to the information available to selected 
      third party partners in accordance with clearly 
      stated guidelines.</p>
    <p class="text"><b>Non-Personally Identifiable 
      Information (Non-PII)</b> - Access to Non-PII 
      is shared, in aggregated format, with GNM Real 
      Media's Web site and advertiser clients who use 
      the aggregated data to determine the reach, effectiveness, 
      future campaign plans, and success of their advertising 
      campaigns. At no time is this non-PII merged with 
      PII. It is useless to any and all parties except 
      as quantifiable data to our advertisers and clients 
      who wish to measure the effectiveness of their 
      campaigns.</p>
