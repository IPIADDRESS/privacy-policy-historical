        <h3>
            Information that is passively or automatically collected
        </h3>

        <p>
            We and third parties may use automated means to collect information about you, your computer, 
            or other device, and your use of the Services.  These automated means include technologies such 
            as cookies, Web server logs, Web beacons, and similar technologies.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Cookies are files that websites and online services create and access on your computer or 
            other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or 
            settings on your device. Our Services may use HTTP cookies, HTML5 cookies, and other 
            types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage).  We may 
            place and read cookies (and similar technologies) when you visit a client's website, 
            or when you visit our own website.  Your browser may tell you how to be notified when 
            you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies.  
            Please note, however, that without cookies or local storage you may not be able to use 
            all of the features of our Site. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In conjunction with the gathering of information through cookies and other 
            automated means, our web servers may log information such as your device type, 
            operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well 
            as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is 
            located. The Web server logs also may record information such as the address of the 
            Web page that referred you to our websites and the IP address of the device you use 
            to connect to the Internet. They also may log information about your interaction with 
            our Services, such as which pages you visit. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When you open an email from or visit the website of one of our clients, we may use cookies, 
            web beacons and similar technologies to collect your email address, the type of device or 
            computer you were using when you opened the email, your IP address, approximate location 
            and the amount of time it took to read the email, browser type, time zone, addresses of 
            web pages visited, and actions taken on websites.  We may combine the information we collect 
            through a client's website or email with a unique identifier and other information provided by 
            the client (or created by us) and with information we obtain from our partners and service 
            providers.

            We may obtain additional information about you from third parties, such as marketers, 
            partners, researchers and others. We may combine information that we collect from you with 
            information about you that we obtain from such third parties.

        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>provide data and feedback to our clients in connection with the provision of our Services;</li>
            <li>
                facilitate and improve the Services, which may include analyzing usage trends, 
                tracking the types of questions we receive and providing support to our clients and visitors 
                to our websites;

                communicate with you in connection with our provision of the Services, 
                including through promotional and administrative emails, updates, newsletters, 
                and other communications;
            </li>
            <li>
                create, tailor, deliver and study the effectiveness of advertising and promotional 
                materials both on and off of the Services, as well as for analytics; 
            </li>
            <li>
                help our clients tailor advertising to you through various channels, including display, 
                email or direct mail.  We may do this by creating interest-based categories based on your 
                use of the Services, such as an interest in mens' apparel or womens' shoes, and we may 
                use cookies and similar technologies to “remember” you in order to help tailor 
                more relevant ads and emails to you. 
            </li>
            <li>
                create aggregated and/or de-identified information, which we may use and disclose without 
                restriction; and
            </li>
            <li>
                investigate, prevent, or take action regarding unlawful or harmful activities, 
                including without limitation, potential threats to the physical safety of a person, 
                potential fraud, and violations of our Terms of Service;
            </li>
            <li>
                And, when you provide us your information through this website (or any other website on 
                which this Policy is posted, we may use that information to target (or re-target) 
                information to you about Movable, such as information about our events or products. 
                You can opt out of most providers that generate online interest-based advertising 
                (such as retargeted display media) by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance's 
                “opt out” portal at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">http://www.aboutads.info</a>.  
                You can opt out of our own 
                email advertising (or that of our clients) by clicking an “opt out” or 
                “unsubscribe” link that you will usually find in the email footer, for 
                marketing emails.

            that we collect through a client's website, email campaigns, and directly from the client 
            and partners.  For example, we provide reports to help clients improve their email marketing 
            campaigns and websites by learning more about the consumers who receive their emails and visit 
            their websites.

            Online Analytics Providers
        </p>

        <p>
            To help us better understand your use of the Services, we may use third-party analytics 
            such as those of Google Analytics, and others. These third parties use the sorts of 
            technologies described in the “Information that is Passively or Automatically 
            Collected Information” section above to help us analyze how our users and our client's 
            end users use the Services.  The information (including your IP address) collected by the 
            technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who 
            use the information to evaluate your use of the Services and share that information with us 
            and our clients. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, 
            you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.

            Browser-based “Do Not Track”
        </h3>

        <p>
            Some browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature that, when turned on, 
            signals to websites and online services that you do not want to be tracked. Because there 
            is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently 
            respond to them.

            Security Of Your Information
        </h3>

        <p>
            We take steps to ensure that your information and the email distribution lists of our clients 
            are treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.  Unfortunately, as with any platform 
            that collects or stores data, neither the Internet or any security protocols can be guaranteed 
            to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect.
