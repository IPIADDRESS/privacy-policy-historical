	<h2>privacy policy</h2>
	<h3>Intro</h3>
		<p>
			Welcome to the Movieclips Inc. (“Movieclips”) web site and online services (the “Movieclips Site”). Movieclips values the privacy of our members and others who visit and use 
			the Movieclips Site (individually, “You” or collectively, “Users”). We take your privacy seriously and make it a priority to protect personally identifiable 
			information that we obtain from and about individuals both online and off-line.
		</p>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it. By using the Movieclips Site 
			(whether or not you are a registered member), you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy. If you do not want 
			information about you to be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Movieclips Site.
		</p>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Movieclips <a href="/about/support/tos">Terms of Use</a>. Your use of the Movieclips Site and any 
			personal information you provide on the Movieclips Site are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Movieclips’ <a href="/about/support/tos">Terms of Use</a>.
		</p>
	<h3>The Information Movieclips Collects:</h3>
		<h4>User-provided Information:</h4>
		<p>
			When you register as a member of the Movieclips Site, you may provide to Movieclips what is generally called “personally identifiable” information (such as your name, 
			password, gender, email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number). From time to time, Movieclips may also ask you optionally to provide other 
			information. If you choose to provide such information, you are giving Movieclips the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, 
			please understand that when you sign in with Movieclips, you are not anonymous to us.
		</p>
		<h4>“Cookies” Information:</h4>
		<p>
			When you visit the Movieclips Site, whether or not you are a registered member, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric 
			characters – to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. Movieclips may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. 
			A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent 
			visits to the Movieclips Site. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. 
			However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services on the Movieclips Site. Third party advertisements displayed in connection with the Movieclips 
			Site may also contain cookies set by internet advertisers. We do not control these cookies and users of the Movieclips Site should check the privacy policy of 
			the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.
		</p>
	<h3>The Way Movieclips Uses Information:</h3>
		<p>
			Movieclips collects personally identifiable information when you register as a member in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. Movieclips generally uses 
			the information you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Movieclips Site. If you have 
			given Movieclips consent, we may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with information about Movieclips’s features, services and other offerings 
			that may be of interest to you. We may also send information or offers to groups of users on behalf of other businesses. Under certain circumstances we may post your 
			personally identifiable information on the Movieclips Site. However, we will notify you of this possibility when collecting personally identifiable information or we 
			will obtain your consent. We may share your personally identifiable information with certain other websites that we link to (and that you click upon) in order to 
			enhance your experience in connection with the Movieclips Site.
		</p>
		<p>
			Movieclips uses all of the information that we collect from Users to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the 
			Movieclips Site works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.
		</p>
		<p>
			Movieclips may use “cookies” information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the 
			Movieclips Site; (b) provide customized third-party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (d) 
			monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have registered as a member and given Movieclips consent, we may share your personally identifiable information with advertisers, business partners, and other entities 
			that are not affiliated with Movieclips who would like to send you information about their products and services.
		</p>
		<p>
			Movieclips’ employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to the personally identifiable information you may provide to register 
			as a member of Movieclips. We may share your personally identifiable information with companies that provide services to us, including outside contractors or agents who help 
			us manage our information activities, but they may only use your personally identifiable information to provide us with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
		</p>
	Anonymous Aggregated Data:
		<p>
			Anonymous data is information (originally personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We may collect 
			anonymous data whether or not you are a registered member of Movieclips. We may use anonymous data for purposes of research or analysis. We may conduct research on our 
			customer demographics, internet usage, and interests and behavior based on personal data we gather. Although anonymous data may be based in part on personal data, 
			it does not identify you personally.
		</p>
		<p>
			Movieclips may share this type of anonymous data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers, and other current and prospective business partners. 
			Movieclips may use anonymous data collected for website administration, advertising, and promotional purposes, and we may share such information with various affiliated and 
			unaffiliated entities for such purposes. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess technology that allows us to customize the advertising and 
			marketing messages You receive while using the Movieclips Site.
		</p>
	<h3>When Movieclips Discloses Information:</h3>
		<p>
			Movieclips discloses automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding 
			the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Movieclips Site.
		</p>
		<p>
			Movieclips may also disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal 
			laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant. In some cases, we may make such disclosures without 
			first providing notice to Users.
		</p>
		<p>
			Movieclips also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect 
			Movieclips from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement 
			agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Movieclips Site; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Movieclips, our Users, or others.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the event that Movieclips is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the 
			information that we have collected from Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
		</p>
	<h3>Your Choices:</h3>
		<p>
			You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Movieclips, in which case Movieclips will not be able to provide to you some of the 
			features and functionality found on the Movieclips Site. If you register as a member of Movieclips, you may update, correct, or delete your profile information and 
			preferences at any time by signing into your account on the Movieclips Site and following the applicable procedures set forth therein.
		</p>
		<p>
			To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. 
			YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.
		</p>
	<h3>Third-Party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:</h3>
		<p>
			The Movieclips Site may be linked to internet websites operated by other companies. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are 
			not operated or maintained by us. Movieclips may also permit other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Movieclips Site. 
			These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, some of the advertisements and links that appear on the Movieclips Site. 
			These advertisers may automatically receive your IP address if this happens. These advertisers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) 
			to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.
		</p>
		<p>
			You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites and third party ad servers or ad networks. Movieclips’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot 
			control the activities of, such other third party advertisers or web sites. Please be aware that Movieclips does not warn you when you have chosen to link through to another website 
			from the Movieclips Site.
		</p>
	<h3>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:</h3>
		<p>
			Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Movieclips does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information 
			on the Movieclips Site from persons under 13 years-of-age. If Movieclips learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been 
			collected on Movieclips without verifiable parental consent, then Movieclips will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian 
			and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a Movieclips Site account, then you may alert Movieclips at <span class="support_email"></span> and request that Movieclips 
			delete that child’s personal information from its systems.
		</p>
	<h3>Our Commitment to Data Security:</h3>
		<p>
			Movieclips uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. 
			We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Movieclips, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission 
			of information, Movieclips makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that 
			such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
		</p>
		<p>
			If Movieclips learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Movieclips may post a notice 
			on the Movieclips Site if a security breach occurs.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
		</p>
	<h3>International Visitors:</h3>
		<p>
			The Movieclips Site is hosted in the United States and is intended solely for visitors located within the United States. If you nonetheless choose to use the Movieclips Site 
			from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your 
			personally identifiable information outside of those regions to the United States and by providing your personally identifiable information on the Movieclips Site you consent 
			to that transfer.
		</p>
	<h3>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy:</h3>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically without further notice to you and this will be reflected by a “Last Modified” date above. Please revisit this page to stay 
			aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Movieclips Site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.
		</p>
	<h3>Movieclips Contact Information:</h3>
		<p>
			Please contact Movieclips with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, our third-party disclosure practices, or your consent choices by email 
			at <span class="support_email"></span>.
