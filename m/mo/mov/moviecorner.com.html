This Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you, as an individual who is a user of the FI Services, the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures.</div>
				<div class="para" id="last-updated-p3">We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us. Unless indicated otherwise FI Services are subject to our <a target="_blank" href="http://find.info/tos/">Terms of Service</a>, this <a target="_blank" href="http://find.info/privacypolicy/">Privacy Policy</a>, and for downloadable software (where applicable) the <a target="_blank" href="http://find.info/eula/">End User License Agreement</a>; Certain FI Services may be subject to different privacy policies and/or terms of service as indicated on the sites from where those services are available and/ or accessed.</div>

				<div class="para bold" id="search-services">A. Search services</div>
				<div class="para" id="search-services-p1">The Search Applications provide features to facilitate Internet search and communication services using the FI Products including through the MyWay and MyWebSearch portals and email.  This search functionality may be implemented through browser settings and "extensions" that set or default your browser homepage, start page, new tab page and/or default search setting(s), depending on which FI Product you are using and what options you select.  We may provide you a way to decline or opt-out of the setting(s) change by unchecking the appropriate checkbox during the download and installation process for the relevant FI Product that provides access to the Search Applications.  Certain FI Products, such as Chrome new tab products, may be available through the online store operated by the browser developer (e.g., the Chrome web store) and the user disclosures and options may vary based on the store’s requirements. The search features, as well as other non-search-related features, may be customized by you.  In addition, you may be able to disable or remove the default search features by removing or disabling the applicable files you downloaded from the FI Products, or changing your default search within your browser, depending on your browser, browser version, and tools and features provided in your respective browser.</div>

				<div class="para bold" id="how">C. How we collect information</div>
				<div class="para"><span id="how-p1">We use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities on the FI Services:</span>
					<ol>
						<li id="how-p2"><span class="bold">Information You Provide To Us.</span> We may collect and store any information you provide when using the FI Services (e.g. when registering on the MyWay Site) or that you provide in some other manner.  This information may include your name, email address, telephone number, username and password or information provided when you log-in to the FI Services via Facebook or any other social media site (you should review the privacy policy of Facebook or any other social media site through which you choose to log into certain FI Services). We also collect and store information and other content you post to the FI Services, where such features are made available (e.g., MyScrapNook). When we provide you with an email inbox as part of an FI Product, we may monitor and collect the contents of such emails in the course of normal maintenance of the relevant FI Product and its systems. Further, in order to permit us to protect the quality of our products and services, we may to the extent permitted by applicable law access your account and records on a case by case basis to investigate complaints or other allegations.</li>
						<li id="how-p3"><span class="bold">Automatically Captured Information.</span> We automatically collect information from your computer and/or device when you use the FI Services.

						<li id="how-p4"><span class="bold">Other Technologies.</span> We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons, cookies and other similar technologies, to track your use of the FI Services (see our cookies policy). Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of sites. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer as part of the FI Services for our users.</li>
						<li>
							<p class="bold" id="how-p5">Information Collected By Third-Parties And Behavioral Advertising.</p>
							<p id="how-p6"><span class="bold">On The FI Services:</span> We may allow third-parties, including our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements or place ad tags or beacons on or via FI Services. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. (To learn more about cookies generally, please go to our <a target="_blank" href="http://find.info/cookies/">Cookies policy</a>. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and evaluate its effectiveness. We may also use information collected by these third-parties to better understand our own users, their interests, how they use our products, improve and customize our products, and to deliver ads targeted to you (either on our FI Services or on other websites whether or not owned and operated by us). Please note, some of these third-party advertising companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, or the Digital Advertising Alliance, each of which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. For more information about limiting third-party advertising cookies, please visit the following links: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">aboutads.info</a>, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">youronlinechoices.com</a>, or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
							<a name="tsa"></a><p id="how-p7"><span class="bold">On Third Party Sites, Services And Applications.</span> Findinfo and its affiliates work with various companies, such as advertisers, ad networks and data management platforms, that may help us and other companies to tailor online ads, including through behavioral advertising designed to target users’ interests and deliver more relevant advertising.  To provide such ads, these third parties may collect and/or we may disclose to these third parties a unique ID that may be associated with your device’s platform or a device/internet browser combination, or they may tell us based on their own data, if that unique ID is associated with a particular segment (such as a reality show watcher falling within a certain demographic (e.g. female aged 30 – 40)).</p>
							<p id="how-p8">We or these third parties may collect the following information (and similar information):</p>
							<ul id="how-p9">
								<li>Demographic data collected on FI Services (e.g., age, zip or postal code, gender) and geographic location derived from your IP address on your visits to, and collected on, the FI Services and non-affiliated websites and applications;</li>
								<li>Data about your use of or visits to the FI Services and non-affiliated websites and applications; </li>
								<li>Data on your interaction with the advertisement displayed on third party websites and applications; and </li>
								<li>Interest and usage data (such as the pages you view and links you click on) acquired from other companies.  </li>
								<li>We may disclose any or all of the collected information to third parties. </li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<p id="how-p10">We or these third parties may use the collected information to provide advertisements of interest to you on certain FI Services and non-affiliated websites and applications and for other purposes described in this privacy policy (such as to improve or customize our products). Three companies we currently work with to target our own ads on other websites based on activity on the FI Services are AppNexus, Adobe and Exelate. If you tell us not to send you these types of ads by opting out (as described <a href="http://find.info/privacypolicy/#cookies">below</a>), you may still see our ads on other companies’ websites, but they will not be specifically tailored to you based on your activity on our FI Services.</p>
							<p id="how-p11">To learn about – and if you would like to, opt-out of targeted advertising from  -- various types of ad networks that we may work with, and who are involved in serving online behavioral advertising, please go to www.aboutads.info/choices, www.networkadvertising.org and/or www.youronlinechoices.com  and opt-out of online behavioral advertising.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="how-p12">Please note that you cannot opt-out of ads on mobile apps via the site listed above.  However, your mobile devices may offer settings that enable users to limit how mobile device ad tracking occurs, using unique device identifiers such as the Apple IDFA and Google Android Advertising ID.  Some information about those settings may be reviewed for Apple <a target="_blank" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228">here</a> and for Android <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en">here</a>.</li>
						<li id="how-p13"><span class="bold">Do not track signals.</span>  FI Services systems are not configured to respond to Web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services.</li>
