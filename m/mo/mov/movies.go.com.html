   <p align="center"><font size="+2"><br>BUENA VISTA ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</font>

   </p><p>The policies below are applicable to movies.com and other sites on the
   World Wide Web portion of the Internet owned and operated by Buena Vista Online.

   </p><p>Buena Vista Online collects personally identifying information only during  (i) contest or sweepstakes Registration, (ii) subscription
    Registration for sites that require subscription, and (iii) online shopping.  In addition, Registration is required and information is collected
	in certain portions of sites in which guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e.,
	community postings, voting, chat, games, or bulletin boards). Buena Vista Online may use such information to award prizes or track compliance
	with our House Rules, or for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event
	Buena Vista Online plans to post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and given the option of
	preventing such posting.

   </p><p><font size="+1">Policies for Individuals Under 13</font>

   </p><p>
   </p><ul>
   <li>Buena Vista Online encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites. </li>
   <li>No information should be submitted to or posted at Buena Vista Online's Web sites by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.
   </li><li>Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Buena Vista Online does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever.
   </li><li>All registrants receive e-mail confirming their Registration. In addition, when a guest under 13 registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an e-mail about Registration and providing instructions on how the parent or guardian can delete the Registration if so desired. 
   </li><li>Although guests under 13 years of age are allowed to participate in contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial Registration process.
   </li><li>No information collected from guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside Buena Vista Online. 
   </li><li>Guests' e-mail addresses are never posted on Buena Vista Online Web sites.
   </li><li>To facilitate global registration within sites operated by Buena Vista Online and its GO Network affiliates all Registration information is shared.  It is our goal to make your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable.
   </li></ul>

   <p>
   <font size="+1">Policies for Individuals 13 Years of Age or Older</font>
   
   </p><p>With the permission of a guest who is 13 years of age or over, information submitted at the time of Registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Buena Vista Online and may
   be shared with our affiliates of GO Network or companies that have been prescreened by Buena Vista Online. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request or by modifying
   his/her Registration information online. When you register with Buena Vista Online, every effort will be made to maintain your information in a secure environment by Buena Vista Online and our affiliates at GO Network. 
   
   </p><p>If you wish to modify your Registration information or stop receiving e-mail updates from Buena Vista Online, just click the "Register" link at the lower left of any page on Buena Vista Online.  Once you have entered your
   or your child's Registration Name and Password, click the "Update Registration" button. You can then modify your information or e-mail requests. When you click the "Update Registration" button, your request will be sent and
   a confirmation notice will appear.
   <br>

</p><p><font size="+1">About IP Addresses</font>

</p><p>Buena Vista Online collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
</p><p>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
</p><p>When guests request pages from Buena Vista Online sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.

</p><p><br><font size="+1">Use of Cookies  -- The Buena Vista Online Cookies Policy</font> 

</p><p>What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our site.
The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. 

</p><p>By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily
tracked with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from Buena Vista Online, you won't be offered as many afterward.

</p><p><font size="+1">Examples of How Buena Vista Online Sites Use Cookies</font>

</p><p>A cookie lets the computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. 

</p><p><font size="+1">How Buena Vista Online Sites Do Not Use Cookies</font>

</p><p>Buena Vista Online sites never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described below, Buena Vista Online sites do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. 
</p><p>Buena Vista Online sites do not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as contest registration (where a cookie allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time).
</p><p>You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.  Buena Vista Online does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to the Buena Vista Online cookie policy. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.
</p><p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the contest and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.

</p><p><font size="+1">Links to Other Sites</font>
</p><p>Users should be aware that when they are on Buena Vista Online sites they could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.  There are links to other sites from Buena Vista Online sites that take you outside our service.  For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click takes you off the Buena Vista Online site.  This includes links from advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use Buena Vista Online's logo as part of a cobranding agreement.  These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.  Always be aware of where you end up.
</p><p>Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online -- for example, via message boards or chat -- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know.  While Buena Vista Online strives to protect its users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.

</p><p><font size="+1">Security Policy</font>

</p><p>The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us.  We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers, utilizing encryption software.
</p><p>Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access, each having signed comprehensive nondisclosure agreements, which provide explicit legal confidentiality protections.  Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.

</p><p><font size="+1">Your Acceptance of These Terms</font>

</p><p>By using this site, you signify your assent to the Buena Vista Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the Buena Vista Online sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. You can send <a href="http://disney.go.com/Mail/">e-mail</a> to us with any further questions.

<p align="CENTER"><b></b></p><h3><b>THE INTERNET, PRIVACY, BUENA VISTA ONLINE AND THE GO NETWORK</b></h3><p></p>

<p>The Internet contains a wealth of information; unfortunately, it may also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail address.  When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you without your knowledge.  At Buena Vista Online and the GO Network we strive to help our customers protect their privacy while using our services.


</p><p><b>BUENA VISTA ONLINE AND THE GO NETWORK'S PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>

<p>Buena Vista Online and the GO Network's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.  This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it.  Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so. 
</p><p>The information you provide for your personal Buena Vista Online Account is shared among the GO Network sites, as it is our goal to make your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable. However, be assured that Buena Vista Online and the GO Network will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. Buena Vista Online and the GO Network may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Buena Vista Online and the GO Network's rights or property, other Buena Vista Online and GO Network users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  Buena Vista Online and the GO Network may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
</p><p>Buena Vista Online and the GO Network share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties.  For example, we will say Buena Vista Online's audience is x percent females and y percent males.  This data is used to customize Buena Vista Online and the GO Network content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users.
</p><p>There are cases where Buena Vista Online may ask you for personal information such as your name, email address, and birth date.  For example, we request personal information when you register for a Buena Vista Online Account, for online shopping or transactions, or for services that require registration or subscription. Buena Vista Online needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with Buena Vista Online and the GO Network policies as well as federal, state and local laws and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes.
</p><p>In case you change your mind or some personal information may change (such as your zip code), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us.  You can do this at the member information page or by contacting our Customer Support organization at <a href="mailto:guest.mail@online.disney.com">guest.mail@online.disney.com</a>. 


</p><p><b>OPTING-OUT</b></p>

<p>Information provided at the time of Registration or submission from a guest who is 13 years of age or over may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Buena Vista Online, the GO Network and our affiliates or companies that have been prescreened by Buena Vista Online and the GO Network.  To keep you in control of your personal information and the communications directed to you, we allow you to opt-out of the following services: sharing your information in our member directory, receiving communications from Buena Vista Online about new features or services, and receiving communications about offers from third-party companies that offer a product or service that we think would be of value to you.  If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request to <a href="mailto:guest.mail@online.disney.com">guest.mail@online.disney.com</a> or by modifying his/her member information online.
</p><p>Information provided when purchasing products from any of our online stores may be used for marketing and promotional purposes and is subject to the opt-out processes described on, or linked to, each order form.


</p><p><b>POLICIES FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE)</b></p>

<p>Buena Vista Online and the GO Network encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the sites.  No information should be submitted to or posted at Buena Vista Online and the GO Network by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.
</p><p>Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Buena Vista Online and the GO Network do not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our guests under 13 years of age.  All registrants receive an e-mail confirming their Registration.  In addition, when a guest under 13 registers, he/she is required to provide the e-mail address of his/her parent or guardian and that parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that Registration.  The parent or guardian must validate the account, as described in the e-mail, in order for the potential member to use most Buena Vista Online and the GO Network interactive services.  No information collected from guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside Buena Vista Online and the GO Network except as explicitly stated during registration for contests or promotions (and in that case, the information collected is used only for the specific contest or promotion).
</p><p>Although guests under 13 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial registration process.  Publication of contest winners names, ages, or images for individuals under 13 require parental or guardian consent.
</p><p>We do not allow guests under 13 years of age to be listed in our member directory or to receive direct marketing communications from Buena Vista Online and the GO Network or to be sent from our third-party offers.


</p><p><b>POLICIES FOR TEENS (INDIVIDUALS 13 TO 17 YEARS OF AGE)</b></p>

<p>Teens are required to provide the e-mail address of a parent or guardian and a notification message is sent to the parent or guardian of all guests who are 13 to 17 years of age which identifies the information supplied at Registration and allows the parent or guardian to be aware of and participate in the guest's  online experience.


</p><p><b>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</b></p>

<p>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 
</p><p>Buena Vista Online and the GO Network collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site.  When guests request pages from Buena Vista Online and the GO Network sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses.  We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.  We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.
</p><p>Some services within Buena Vista Online and the GO Network, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message.  Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing.


</p><p><b>USE OF COOKIES</b></p>

<p>What are cookies?  Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.  Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site.  We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies.  The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. 
</p><p>By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not.  Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed.  This information is most easily tracked with cookies.  We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users needs.
</p><p>Buena Vista Online and the GO Network have two primary uses for its cookies.  First, we use them to specify unique preferences.  For example, in GO Network's News Center, users can specify keywords across several news categories.  This way you don't have to tell us over and over again about the kinds of news stories you want to see.  Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns.  This helps us better understand and improve areas of the Buena Vista Online and the GO Network service that our users find valuable.  While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to Buena Vista Online and the GO Network always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences.  Information from cookies is sometimes attached to messages sent to our Customer Service department 
</p><p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.  You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, note that some parts of the Buena Vista Online and the GO Network service will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies.  For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized news preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests, or playing games.
</p><p>You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.  Buena Vista Online and the GO Network do not control these cookies.  The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.


</p><p><b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</b></p>

<p>Users should be aware that when you are on Buena Vista Online and the GO Network, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.  There are links to other sites from Buena Vista Online and the GO Network pages that take you outside our service.  For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or a Buena Vista Online search result, the "click" takes you off the Buena Vista Online site.  This includes links from advertisers, Center sponsors and partners that may use Buena Vista Online or the GO Network's logo as part of a co-branding agreement.  These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.
</p><p>Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online --- for example, via message boards or chat --- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know.  While Buena Vista Online and the GO Network strive to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.
</p><p>Buena Vista Online and the GO Network's policy do not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Buena Vista Online and the GO Network's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. 


</p><p><b>SECURITY</b></p>

<p>The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us.  We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Buena Vista Online and the GO Network can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.  When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
</p><p>Your Buena Vista Online and GO Network Account is password protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account.  We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.  Buena Vista Online and the GO Network will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.  Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.
</p><p>Remember to sign out of your Buena Vista Online or GO Network Account and close your browser window when you have finished your work.  This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café.


</p><p><b>YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS</b></p>

<p>By using this site, you signify your assent to the Buena Vista Online and the GO Network Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites.  Your continued use of the Buena Vista Online and GO Network sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
