<b>MOVAVI.COM: PRIVACY POLICY</b>
<br><br>
At MOVAVI, your security and privacy is of the utmost importance to us.
We take the following steps to protect your personal information: 
<br><br>
<b>PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>
<br><br>
MOVAVI collects basic contact information when you subscribe to newsletter or
fill in a contact form. This information will be used for administrative and
identification purposes only and will not be shared with our partners or third
parties. Personal information is stored on MOVAVI computers 
and is only accessed by authorized MOVAVI personnel. 
<br><br>
<b>COOKIES</b>
<br><br>
MOVAVI uses a cookie to store your visiting and referrer information. 
A cookie is a small text file, stored on your computer's hard drive, that 
can be read by our system when you return to our site.
<br><br>
<b>GENERAL INFORMATION</b>
<br><br>
MOVAVI also collects general demographic information about visitors to 
our site. The information we collect creates a broad picture of our 
population rather than focusing on any one individual. This information 
is used to continually refine our products and to identify the most 
popular areas of our site.
<br><br>
<b>ENCRYPTED CREDIT CARD PURCHASES</b>
<br><br>
If you use a credit card to purchase a MOVAVI product, the credit card 
number is encrypted as it passes over the internet. Your credit card 
number is not kept or recorded by MOVAVI or our computers - it is simply 
passed through to the credit card company to purchase the course. In this 
respect, buying a course from MOVAVI is similar to a credit 
card purchase at any store. Neither MOVAVI nor the store 
keeps your credit card number on file.
<br><br>
More than anything, MOVAVI tries to treat its customers as each one
of us would like to be treated. We value our privacy and we value yours, 
too. It is our goal to make your experience with MOVAVI a safe 
and positive experience.
