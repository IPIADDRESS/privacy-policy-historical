<p>(last update September 2006)</p>
				
<p>MovieTickets.com, Inc. ("MovieTickets.com") has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website:</p>

<p>By accepting this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner prescribed in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our terms of use.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy contains a number of references to other information pages on our Site and other websites.  Please note: underlined words and phrases are click-through links to these pages and websites.  We strongly recommend that as you read this Privacy Policy, you click on such links to obtain further important details about the Privacy Policy, as they may contain further terms and conditions which apply to you.</p>

<p>Please note that your Information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States.  The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the UK laws but we will hold and transmit your Information in a safe, confidential and secure environment.  We will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.  If you object to your information being transferred or used in this way please do not register or provide us with such information.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, send an email to <a href="mailto:feedback@movietickets.com">feedback@movietickets.com</a>.</p>


<p class="mgnt20 pd5 sc8 ft5 bld">Overview</p>

<p>Your Privacy is very important to us.  As part of the normal operation of our services we collect and, in some cases, may disclose information about you.  This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information.</p>

<p>As described below, some of your personally identifiable information is disclosed to third parties and used by us and third parties.  By accepting the Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information.</p> 


<p class="mgnt20 pd5 sc8 ft5 bld">Information Collection, Use, Sharing and Disclosure</p>

<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website and services. Through customer surveys, subscriptions, and newsletter registration, our site may request users to give us contact, demographic and/or financial information (such as their name, locale, gender, age, income level and email address). The demographic information is used, among other things, to enhance user experience so we can be more content specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new services and content, as well as for surveys and newsletters. Our site may use an order form for customers to subscribe to our for-pay services. We collect contact information (like e-mail address) and financial information (like account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send billing invoices. Contact information is also used to get in touch with the subscribers when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future communications; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services and for in-house statistics. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Information collected during MovieTickets.com subscriber registration is used for, among other things, in-house statistics, marketing target information, and advising clients of MovieTickets.com news and information. This site contains links to other sites. MovieTickets.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or any website from which you may have linked to MovieTickets.com.</p> 

<p>MovieTickets.com is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read this privacy policy to fully understand how we will make use of the personal information you share with us. MovieTickets.com collects certain personal information in order to provide you with customized services, content, and advertisements. Some personal information is gathered when you register to receive certain MovieTickets.com products or services. We may disclose to third parties certain aggregate information contained in your registration data or related data, provided that, such information will NOT include personally identifying information, except as specifically authorized by you or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal process, or to enforce the terms of service. In addition, we may provide your personally identifiable and personal financial information to third parties if you provide prior consent to the exchange of the information. MovieTickets.com will also use your personal information for the purposes of providing you with any services to which you subscribe, and any service-related activities such as collecting subscription fees from you for those services, and notifying you or contacting you regarding any problem with, or the expiration of, such services. In this regard, it may be necessary for MovieTickets.com to disclose your personal information to one or more agents and contractors of MovieTickets.com and their subcontractors, but such agents, contractors, and subcontractors will be required to agree to use the information obtained from MovieTickets.com only for these purposes. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. MovieTickets.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your MovieTickets.com account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, MovieTickets.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. MovieTickets.com reserves the right to change this statement at any time by posting revisions on the MovieTickets.com web site. This privacy policy is not intended to, and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of us.</p> 

<p>We may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their name and email address) and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, and/or income level). The user's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary, such as if they win a contest or to notify users of upcoming contests. There are three primary types of contests: (1.) We host solely and all information that is collected stays in-house. (2.) We may share address information with third party for shipping purposes. (3.) In some rare instances, a third party may host the contest and all information is then shared. For customer inquiries about our information sharing practices please write to MovieTickets.com, Customer Service, 2255 Glades Road, Suite 221A, Boca Raton, FL 33431. In our contest registration, we give our users the opportunity to sign up for the MovieTickets.com newsletter. However, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by selecting the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletter. MovieTickets.com products and services are directed at an adult market, and therefore this site is intended for use by adults only. MovieTickets.com encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet, and to inform them of the dangers of providing information about themselves over the Internet. Children of any age should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. No information should be submitted to or posted on this web site by users under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.  Children are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us.  If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with your parents or guardians.</p>

<p>Some MovieTickets.com services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both MovieTickets.com, Inc. and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. These companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>

<p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your information that they collect from our Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.</p> 


<p class="mgnt20 pd5 sc8 ft5 bld">Children</p>

<p>The MovieTickets.com site and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.  When MovieTickets.com does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the site will either block such users from providing personal information or will seek to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children’s personal information.  We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.</p>

<p>Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use MovieTickets.com services, this will include such general audience communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages. Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of their children's personal information. If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent.</p>

<p>We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online.</p>


<p class="mgnt20 pd5 sc8 ft5 bld">Parental Access</p>

<p>At MovieTickets.com, our goal is to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe and fun online experience. That's why we've set up a system by which parents can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any identifiable information collected about their child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their child's information. <a href="http://www.movietickets.com/docs/access.pdf" target="_blank">You can link to the form from here</a>. Movietickets.com takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.</p> 

<p>If MovieTickets.com collects personally identifiable information from children, it will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Policy Act of 1998 (U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).</p> 


<p class="mgnt20 pd5 sc8 ft5 bld">Your California Privacy Rights</p>

<p>Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:webmaster@movietickets.com">webmaster@movietickets.com</a> or write us:</p>

<p class="mgnt20 pd5 sc8 ft5 bld">Advertisements</p>

<p>Ads appearing on this web site are delivered to you by either (a) one of our web advertising partners or (b) by us. Information about your visit to this site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for instance) and whether or not you responded to the ad delivered, (but not your name, address, phone number or other personal information), is used to serve advertisements to you on this site. We may use your zip code or geographical location information to serve advertisements to this site. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally, unless you have provided us with your prior consent to disclose such personally identifiable information.
