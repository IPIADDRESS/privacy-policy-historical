				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Protecting children is the first priority of all activities at
MoshiGames.com.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Privacy policies aren't very interesting, but we know they are
important because we want to have the confidence and support of parents,
teachers and Moshi Game players. A clear privacy policy is an important
part of the Moshi Game experience.</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>MoshiGames.com is owned by Mind Candy, a company based in the United
Kingdom.</p>

<h2>What data we collect</h2>

<p>At this time, MoshiGames.com collects absolutely no data whatsoever.
That's pretty simple isn't it :) In the future, we may require
registration to play on the MoshiGames.com site. When that time comes,
this privacy policy will change and be MUCH longer but we'll be sure
it's still clear and easy to understand.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>We collect non-personal information from all players by placing and
accessing cookies on the computer being used to access MoshiGames.com.
Cookies are used to store player preferences, but DO NOT contain ANY
personal information.</p>

<h2>Game Play Data</h2>

<p>When a player uses MoshiGames.com, we collect aggregated anonymous
data for the purpose of identifying trends, likes and dislikes. That's
it!</p>

<h2>Legislation</h2>

<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), is a program
administered by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. MoshiGames.com
endeavours to comply with COPPA, and other relevant legislation. If you

effort to prevent and discourage players from sharing any sort of
personally identifiable information with each other via email, feedback
