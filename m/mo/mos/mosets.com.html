						<p>
			Mosets Consulting ("Mosets", "we" and "us") respects the privacy of its users ("you") and has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy.
		</p>
		<p>
			This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are
			concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information'
			(PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and
			information security, is information that can be used on its own or
			with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single
			person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our
			privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we
			collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally
			Identifiable Information in accordance with our service.<br>

		</p><p>By using our website or application (our "Service"), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p></p>

		<h4>What personal information do we collect from the people
			that visit our blog, website or app?</h4>

		<p>
			When ordering or registering on our service, as appropriate, you may
			be asked to enter your name, email address, phone number or other
			details to help you with your experience.
		</p>

		<h4>When do we collect information?</h4>

		<p>
			We collect information from you when you register through a website, a mobile application,
			subscribe to a newsletter, fill out a form or enter information on
			our site.
		</p>

		<h4>How do we use your information?</h4>

		<p>
			We may use the information we collect from you when you register,
			make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or
			marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other
			site features in the following ways:
		</p><ul>
			<li>To perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our or othersâ€™ products, services, or content;</li>
			<li>To
				personalize user's experience and to allow us to deliver the type
				of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</li>
			<li>To improve
				our service in order to better serve you.
			</li>
			<li>To allow us
				to better service you in responding to your customer service
				requests.</li>
			<li>To
				administer a contest, promotion, survey or other service feature.</li>
			<li>To quickly
				process your transactions.</li>
			<li>To communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or other third parties.</li>
			<li>To develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Service and other sites, including providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites;</li>
			<li>To perform website or mobile application analytics.</li>
<!--			<li>To enforce or exercise any rights in our Terms of Use.</li> -->
		</ul>
		<p></p>

		<h4>How do we protect visitor information?</h4>

		<p>
			Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and
			is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special
			access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the
			information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit
			information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
			technology.
		</p>

		<p>
			We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an
			order enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain
			the safety of your personal information.
		</p>

		<p>
			All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are
			not stored or processed on our servers.
		</p>

		<h4>Do we use 'cookies'?</h4>

		<p>
			Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider
			transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser
			(if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's
			systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain
			information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and
			process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help
			us understand your preferences based on previous or current site
			activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.
			We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site
			traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site
			experiences and tools in the future.
		</p>

		<h4>We use cookies to:</h4>
		<p>
		</p><ul>
			<li>Help
				remember and process the items in the shopping cart.</li>
			<li> Understand
				and save user's preferences for future visits.</li>
			<li>Keep track
				of advertisements.</li>
			<li>Compile
				aggregate data about site and service traffic and site interactions in order to
				offer better service experiences and tools in the future. We may also
				use trusted third party services that track this information on our
				behalf.</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>

		<h4>Third Party Disclosure</h4>

		<p>
			We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties
			your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with
			advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and
			other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting
			our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to
			keep this information confidential. We may also release your
			information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with
			the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others'
			rights, property, or safety.</p>
		<p>
			However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be
			provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other
			uses.
		</p>

		<h4>Third party links</h4>

		<p>
			Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third
			party products or services on our service. These third party sites
			have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have
			no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of
			these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity
			of our service and welcome any feedback about these sites.
		</p>

		<h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>

		<p>
			When it comes to the collection of personal information from
			children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
			(COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the
			nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which
			spells out what operators of websites and online services must do
			to protect children's privacy and safety online.
		</p>

		<p>
			We do not specifically market to children under 13.
