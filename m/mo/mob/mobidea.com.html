<h1>MOBIDEA PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<h2>Privacy Policy Statement</h2>

<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our dedication to respecting your
privacy. This Privacy Policy sets out our practices with respect to personal information
collected from visitors to the Site as well as registered affiliates (collectively referred to
as "you"). This Site operates an affiliate program and is solely restricted to adults who are
capable of entering into contractual relationships. Any persons under the age of eighteen
are strictly prohibited from using this Site or signing up for an account with our affiliate
program. We do not intentionally collect information on individuals under the age of
eighteen. By visiting this Site and/or signing up for an affiliate account, you agree and
consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time, as well as the
Mobidea Terms and Conditions also located on this Site.</p>

<h2>What Information is Collected:</h2>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>We collect personal information that is voluntarily provided to us via the registration
form for our affiliate program. This information may include, but not be limited to,
the affiliate’s name, physical address, phone number, email address, instant messenger
address, payment method information (such as bank account information), password, and
on occasion a unique identifier (such as their mother's maiden name). If an affiliate sends
any personal communication or correspondence, by any means, to the Site, or any of its
employees, agents or representatives, the Site may collect any information regarding that
communication and include that information in its customer database.</p>

<h2>Non-Personal Information and Cookies</h2>

<p>Certain non-personal information may be collected from visitors to this Site including,
but not limited to, their browser type, browser language, operating system, IP address,
and the domain name from which they accessed the Site. Other non-personal information
may be collected such as browsing behavior, date and time of visit, the pages visited, the
time spent viewing the Site, the number of times the visitor returns to the Site, and click-
stream data. We do not track any information about visitors once they leave our Site.
We may use cookies to collect this information. We may also allow unaffiliated third
parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to visitors of our Site. You are always free
to decline cookies, but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our
Site.</p>

<h2>Use of Information</h2>

<p>We collect personal information so that we may custom tailor the web experience for
each affiliate and offer the best products and services to meet the needs of each affiliate.</p>

<p>We may use information collected from visitors to our Site for any of the following
purposes: (1) to send affiliates information and promotional materials about our
company, which will not continue if opted out of, (2) to send affiliates limited and only
occasional information and promotional materials from our marketing partners and
third parties, (3) to deliver highly targeted but very limited display advertisements and
offers by email, which will not continue if opted out of, (4) to contact affiliates to our
Site when necessary, (5) to allow one-click purchases or access to proprietary content
by pre-populating fields, within registration or other transaction screens, with a visitor's
name, billing address, all as provided by that visitor, (6) to help diagnose problems with
our server, (7) to administer our Site, (8) to conduct internal reviews of our Site (e.g., to
determine the number of visitors to the Site), (9) to help us better understand visitors' use
of our Site, and (10) to protect the security or integrity of our Site.</p>

<p>Since part of the personal information that is collected and safeguarded by us is your
email address, we try very hard to respect your time and privacy by controlling and
limiting the frequency of mailings. If you receive a mailing from us or one of our
marketing partners, it is because your email address is either listed with us as someone
who has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the
future, or you have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship
with us. Your registration for our affiliate program is your consent to these occasional
mailing.</p>

<p>There may be occasions when you will be presented with special offers either from us
or from third-party service or content providers, which may include communications,
newsletters, commercial advertising, or other promotional or special event materials
(collectively referred to as "Offers"). Your consent to this Privacy Policy acts as your
consent to receive these occasional mailings by us and by our third party service or
content providers.</p>

<p>The Site is not responsible or liable for the use of any information that an affiliate may
provide, or that is gathered by third-party websites that have ads or links on the Site. This
Site does not control, monitor or endorse the information gathering practices or Privacy
Policies of any of those third-party websites. Whenever applicable, each affiliate should
seek to read the Privacy Policy of any third-party website provider that has an advertising
banner, advertises or has a link on the Site or in an email.</p>

<p>If you have received unsolicited email sent via this system or purporting to be
sent via this system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to
<a href="mailto:abuse@mobidea.com">abuse@mobidea.com</a>.</p>

<p>We take unwanted email complaints very seriously and maintain an opt-out system to
assist you in removing your name from our mailing.</p>

<h2>Removing your name off our list</h2>

<p>If you wish to be removed off of our mailing list, please send us an email to
<a href="mailto:abuse@mobidea.com">abuse@mobidea.com</a> and we will gladly remove you.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>This Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the
information under our control. For all other information, visitors and affiliates should
consider this communication and information to be non-confidential, and consequently,
we assume no responsibility or liability if any information relating to any visitor or
subscriber is intercepted and/or used by an unintended recipient.</p>

<h2>Acceptance of these Terms</h2>

<p>By visiting or registering to become an affiliate, you agree to the practices described
in this Privacy Policy. We may at any time revise or amend any of these terms and
conditions without notice. You are bound by any such revisions and should therefore
periodically visit this page to review the then-current terms and conditions to which
you are bound. To the extent that any of the third-party sites accessible through our Site
(such as our advertisers) have different privacy practices from those stated in this Privacy
Policy, those third-party privacy practices govern the collection and use of information
you provide when visiting those sites. We are not responsible for the policies, content,
and practices of other companies which may collect personal information as a third-party
web service provider that has an advertising banner or link on the Site.</p>
