<h1>Mobile Business Briefing - Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>MOBILE BUSINESS BRIEFING PRIVACY POLICY </strong></p>
<p>The GSM Association and its group companies, including but not limited to GSMC Limited and GSM Media LLC (hereinafter referred to as "GSMA"), take the privacy of your information very seriously. This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how and for what purposes we use the information collected about you through Mobile Business Briefing (referred to below as "MBB"). Please read this Policy carefully.</p>
<p>By subscribing to MBB and any services we offer via MBB, you are agreeing to be bound by this Policy in respect of the information collected about you via MBB. You acknowledge and agree (on your own behalf and duly authorised on behalf of any third party whose details you supply) that the processing (including disclosure) of personal information is necessary or desirable for the provision of relevant services and the operation of GSMA's performance of its rights and obligations owed to you or a third party. </p>
<p>The references to information 'relating to you' or 'about you' include references to information about your employees, representatives, agents, directors, officers, shareholders or other relevant parties whose details you have provided and those of your affiliates and subsidiaries and sub-contractors and those of any third party whose details you supply to GSMA. </p>
<p>We may update this Policy from time to time to take account of changing requirements and we request that you refer back to this Policy frequently to review any revisions. If at any time we decide to use personal information in a manner significantly different to that stated in this Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this new manner. If you have any queries about the Policy, please get in touch with us using the contact details set out at Contact Us below and we will do our best to answer your questions. </p>
