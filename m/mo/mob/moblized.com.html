                    <p>Protecting your private information is our priority. This
                    Statement of Privacy applies to the Moblized.com and Moblized and

                    Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to Moblized include
                    Moblized.com. The Moblized website is a commerce application
                    marketplace site. By using the Moblized website, you consent to the
                    data practices described in this statement.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold">Collection of your Personal
                    Information</p>

                    <p>Moblized may collect personally identifiable information, such
                    as your name. If you purchase Moblized's products and services, we
                    collect billing and credit card information. This information is
                    used to complete the purchase transaction. Moblized may also
                    collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to
                    you, such as your age and gender. We may gather additional personal
                    or non-personal information in the future.</p>

                    <p>Information about your computer hardware and software may be
                    automatically collected by Moblized. This information can include:
                    your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and
                    referring website addresses. This information is used for the
                    operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and
                    to provide general statistics regarding use of the Moblized
                    website.</p>

                    <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally
                    identifiable information or personally sensitive data through
                    Moblized's public message boards, this information may be collected
                    and used by others.</p>

                    <p>Moblized encourages you to review the privacy statements of
                    websites you choose to link to from Moblized so that you can
                    understand how those websites collect, use and share your
                    information. Moblized is not responsible for the privacy statements
                    or other content on websites outside of the Moblized website.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold">Use of your Personal Information</p>

                    <p>Moblized collects and uses your personal information to operate
                    its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.</p>

                    <p>Moblized may also use your personally identifiable information
                    to inform you of other products or services available from Moblized
                    and its affiliates. Moblized may also contact you via surveys to
                    conduct research about your opinion of current services or of
                    potential new services that may be offered.</p>

                    <p>Moblized does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to
                    third parties.</p>

                    <p>Moblized may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of
                    external business partners about a particular offering that may be
                    of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally
                    identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number)
                    is transferred to the third party. Moblized may share data with
                    trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you
                    email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for
                    deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your
                    personal information except to provide these services to Moblized,
                    and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your
                    information.</p>

                    <p>Moblized may keep track of the websites and pages our users
                    visit within Moblized, in order to determine what Moblized services
                    are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized
                    content and advertising within Moblized to customers whose behavior
                    indicates that they are interested in a particular subject
                    area.</p>

                    <p>Moblized will disclose your personal information, without
                    notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith
                    belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts
                    of the law or comply with legal process served on Moblized or the
                    site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Moblized;
                    and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal
                    safety of users of Moblized, or the public.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold">Use of Cookies</p>

                    <p>The Moblized website may use "cookies" to help you personalize
                    your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on
                    your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
                    programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
                    assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain
                    that issued the cookie to you.</p>

                    <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a
                    convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to
                    tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
                    example, if you personalize Moblized pages, or register with
                    Moblized site or services, a cookie helps Moblized to recall your
                    specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the
                    process of recording your personal information, such as billing
                    addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the
                    same Moblized website, the information you previously provided can
                    be retrieved, so you can easily use the Moblized features that you
                    customized.</p>

                    <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web
                    browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify
                    your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
                    choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
                    the interactive features of the Moblized services or websites you
                    visit.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold">Security of your Personal
                    Information</p>

                    <p>Moblized secures your personal information from unauthorized
                    access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a
                    credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is
                    protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets
                    Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold">Children Under Thirteen</p>

                    <p>Moblized does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
                    information from children under the age of thirteen. If you are
                    under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for
                    permission to use this website.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold">Disconnecting your Moblized Account
                    from Third Party Websites</p>

                    <p>You will be able to connect your Moblized account to third party
                    accounts. BY CONNECTING YOUR MOBLIZED ACCOUNT TO YOUR THIRD PARTY
                    ACCOUNT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE
                    CONTINUOUS RELEASE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO OTHERS (IN
                    ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR PRIVACY SETTINGS ON THOSE THIRD PARTY SITES).
                    IF YOU DO NOT WANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU, INCLUDING PERSONALLY
                    IDENTIFYING INFORMATION, TO BE SHARED INTHIS MANNER, DO NOT USE THE
                    THIS FEATURE. You may disconnect your account from a third party
                    account at any time. Users may learn how to disconnect their
                    accounts from third-party websites by visiting their "My Account"
                    page. Users may also contact us via email or telephone..</p>
