			<h4><b>Effective Date: October 15, 2015</b></h4>

<p><span class="text-uppercase">Tune</span>, Inc. (“<span class="text-uppercase">Tune</span>”, “we”, “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of end users. This policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information when you visit our website, http://www.tune.com. </p>

<h4>U.S.—E.U. and U.S.—Swiss Safe Harbor</h4>

<p><span class="text-uppercase">Tune</span> complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  <span class="text-uppercase">Tune</span> has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.&nbsp; To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view <span class="text-uppercase">Tune</span> certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>

<p><b>October 2015 update:</b> <span class="text-uppercase">Tune</span> is awaiting additional regulatory guidance for compliance for EU to US data transfers, given the European Court of Justice's recent decision on the Safe Harbor. In the meantime, we urge all clients to continue to obtain end user consent for data sharing with <span class="text-uppercase">Tune</span>, and respect other privacy protections under EU law. You and <span class="text-uppercase">Tune</span> are compliant during this period of uncertainty so long as you don't upload or share personal data with <span class="text-uppercase">Tune</span> products (e.g. email addresses that are not hashed or otherwise secured). See section 9.3 of the <span class="text-uppercase">Tune</span> Master Services Agreement for more details (available at <a href="//www.tune.com/msa" title="TUNE MSA">www.tune.com/msa</a>).</p>
