				develop and manage smart phone and tablet applications (each a “Mobile Application”) and mobile website solutions (each
				a “Mobile Site”) as well as related hosting and support services (the "Service"). As used in this document “Mobile Offering”
				means the Mobile Applications and Mobile Sites.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy is made available on our website at

				<a href="/privacy" title="Mobile Roadie - iPhone and Android mobile apps with full CMS and no coding required - Privacy Policy">https://mobileroadie.com/privacy</a> (“Site”), and provides information on our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal
				information we receive from (i) Mobile Roadie Customers, (ii) end users that download, access and/or use the Mobile Offerings
				(“End Users”), and (iii) visitors just browsing the Site (“Visitors”). This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to
				time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult
				this policy regularly for any changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the
				information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited
				to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within
				our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

					Date of birth
				</li>

			</p>
			<h2>(A) Mobile Roadie Customers</h2>
			<p><strong>What personal information do we collect?</strong></p>
			<p>
				If you are a Mobile Roadie Customer, when you register with us through the Site to create and manage Mobile Offerings, we
				will ask you for personally identifiable information, such as your full name, company name, email address, billing address,
				phone, payment information.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, we may collect information related to interactions of End Users with your Mobile Offerings as described in part
				(B) below.
			</p>
			<p><strong>How we use your personal data?</strong></p>
			<p>
				We use such personally identifiable information (in some cases, in conjunction with your non-identifying information, such
				as your zip code) mainly to provide the Mobile Roadie services, register you as customer for mobile offering creation
				and management, complete your transactions, administer your inquiries, and contact Mobile Roadie Customers regarding
				account activities, new version and product offerings, or other communications relevant to the Mobile Roadie services.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not sell any personally identifiable information of Mobile Roadie Customers to any third parties. The instances where
				we may share such information with third parties are described in part (D) below.
			</p>
			<p><strong>How you can access, update or delete your data?</strong></p>
			<p>
				You may review and update the personally identifiable information in your registration profile by logging in and editing
				such information in your dashboard. If you decide to delete all of your personal information we may cancel your account.
				You can also send a request to
				<a href="mailto:support@mobileroadie.com">support@mobileroadie.com</a> to initiate the removal of your personal data. The request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary
				for any Services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, you have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we process about you. This comprises any personal
				information we process on the basis of your consent. You have the right to receive this information in a structured,
				commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer that personal information
				to another party. You may contact us at

				Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. Please note that we may not be able to provide you with
				personal information if providing it would interfere with another's rights (e.g., where providing the personal information
				we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).
			</p>

				such as your name, email address, phone number, location and other optional information that we may choose to collect.
				This optional information is not required to use the Free Mobile Website Solution. We may use your personally identifiable
				information collected in these instances to contact you with information that may be of interest to you. If you no longer
				wish to receive such information from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
				In the event that a Mobile Roadie Customer converts its Free Mobile Website Solution to one for which the customer must
				pay a fee to provide via our Service, the personally identifiable information and other information retained by Mobile
				Roadie prior to the date of conversion (“Specific Shared Data”), will be shared with the Mobile Roadie Customer for use
				by such customer to provide you with information and marketing materials about its own products and services. We only
				share Specific Shared Data with a Mobile Roadie Customer pursuant to an agreement under which such customer is obligated
				to maintain and use the Specific Shared Data it receives solely in compliance with the Mobile Roadie Privacy Policy.

				geographic location of the IP address you are using to access the Internet.
			</p>

				alerts when you get a new message. You may at any time turn off this functionality by using the in-app privacy settings.

				Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management,
				web analytics and improvement of the Site's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used.
				These third parties have access to information that we collect from Mobile Roadie Customers, End Users and Visitors only
				to perform these tasks on our behalf.
			</p>
			<p>
				Business Transfers. Mobile Roadie may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including personally identifiable
				information collected from Mobile Roadie Customers, End Users and Visitors, in connection with a merger, acquisition,
				reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Mobile Roadie cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private
				parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information collected from Mobile Roadie Customers,
				End Users and Visitors to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe
				necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect
				the property and rights of Mobile Roadie or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent
				or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
			</p>
			<p><strong>How we secure, store and retain your data</strong></p>
			<p>
				Mobile Roadie is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures
				designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach
				of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined
				in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in
				the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs
				of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity
				of the data system.
			</p>
			<p>
				We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal data we collect, both during transmission and once
				received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate.
			</p>
			<p>
				We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested and thereafter for a variety
				of legitimate legal or business purposes. These might include retention periods:
			</p>
			<ul class="styled">
				<li>
					mandated by law, contract or similar obligations applicable to our business operations;
				</li>
				<li>
					for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights;
				</li>
				<li>
					needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you have any questions about the security or retention of your personal data, you can contact us at
				<a href="mailto:support@mobileroadie.com">support@mobileroadie.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p><strong>International Transfer</strong></p>
			<p>
				Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or
				other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you
				are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Mobile Roadie transfers personally identifiable
				information to the United States and processes it there. Whether you are a Mobile Roadie Customer, an End-User or a Visitor,
				your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that
				transfer.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
			<p>
				Our Site contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type
				of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact
				that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization
				or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information
				security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place
				their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites
				follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you
				to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Our Policy Toward Children</strong></p>
			<p>
				Neither this Site nor the Service is directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
				from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable
				information without their consent, he or she should contact us at
				<a href="mailto:support@mobileroadie.com">support@mobileroadie.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such
				information from our files.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Beacon Partners</strong></p>
			<p>
				We share data we collect about you including unique identification numbers associated with mobile devices or through its
				API (including, for example, a Unique ID for Advertisers ("IDFA"), Unique ID for Vendors ("IDFV"), Google Ad ID, or Windows
				Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model,
				and, depending on the user's mobile device settings and consent, the geographical location data, including GPS coordinates
				(e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of the mobile device (“User Data”) with
				our third party partners, that enables us to use Bluetooth beacons to provide you with information or offers specific
				to your location and interests.
			</p>
			<p>
				By using our Service and installing Apps containing our Signal360 integration, you give the App permission to access your
				device's microphone while our App is running (including while running in the background). The microphone is used as part
				of Signal360's PMT by detecting Beacons which emit a high frequency audio signal that cannot be heard by humans. All
				audio data received by the App is stored for a short time in the device's transient buffer memory which is constantly
				being deleted and overwritten with newer audio data. The length of the audio data stored in transient buffer memory at
				any given time before it is overwritten with newer audio data is up to one millisecond. None of the audio data received
				by the App is retained by or transmitted from your device to Signal360 servers, Beacons, or any other device. The App
				scans the audio data received by your device's microphone for the high frequency signal emitted by the Beacon and discards
				the audio data of all other frequencies. As described above, the non-discarded high frequency data is only stored in
				increments of up to one millisecond and is subsequently overwritten by new high frequency data in one millisecond increments.
				When the App detects a Beacon, it may match the signal with a set of marketing materials on your device. All marketing
				materials are pre-downloaded to the App as part of its regular update process. No marketing materials are sent to your
				device by the Beacons themselves. To put plainly: Our App does not at any time store more than up to one millisecond
				of your microphone's surrounding audio data; (ii) our Technology then filters and uses only the high frequency wavelengths
				(not audible to the human ear) of the audio data it stores for our Services; (iii) our App does not transmit any of the
				audio data it captures outside of your phone (neither to our servers or to any third party servers); and (iv) all audio
				data captured by our App is deleted and overwritten in up to one millisecond increments.
			</p>
			<p>
				By accepting our terms of service, you consent to the collection, storage and processing the aforementioned data by our third
				party partners for the purposes of: (i) providing or improving their services; (ii) enabling third parties to assist
				us and the retailer and venues (in which the beacons are located) in better serving and understanding our users; and
				(iii) sharing your data with third parties so they can provide or enable the provision of content, offers or other marketing
				solutions that may be of interest to you. You also consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United
				States or any other jurisdiction in which our third party partners or their parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, service
				providers or partners maintain facilities. If you do not consent to the collection and transfer of the aforementioned
				data through the identification of your mobile device, we recommend that you: (a) delete our app or adjust the in-app
				settings of the app; or (b) delete the applicable mobile advertiser ID by limiting ad tracking on the device. For iOS,
				navigate to your Settings &gt; Select Privacy &gt; Select Advertising &gt; Enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. For Android,
				open your Google Settings app &gt; Ads &gt; Enable “Opt out of interest-based advertising".
