<h3><b>DEFINITIONS</b></h3>

<p><b>Advertiser:</b> An Advertiser is any person or company that promotes their product or a component of their product using the MAT Platform. For example, Advertisers may promote their mobile application, a specific promotion within their app, an app update, or a company announcement, and use MAT to attribute these events.</p> 

<p><b>Attribution:</b> Attribution is a general term used to describe the process of measuring user interactions in an app and within the advertising ecosystem. For example, a user may click on an advertisement, download an app, and make an in-app purchase - each of these actions would be considered an Attribution within the MAT Platform.</p>

<p><b>Unique Advertising Identifiers:</b> Unique Advertising Identifiers are user-specific, unique character strings for advertising that can be reset by the user. Examples of Unique Advertising Identifiers include IDFA (developed by Apple for the iPhone), Google Ad ID (developed by Google for Android), and Windows advertising ID (developed by Microsoft for the Windows Phone). Additional information is available <a href="http://support.mobileapptracking.com/entries/22541461-Unique-Identifiers-for-Attribution" title="Unique Identifiers for Attribution" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Geographic Location Data:</b> Advertiser clients may collect Geographic Location Data from an IP address through the Platform to give them deeper insight into the performance of their advertising campaigns. Geographic Location data is non-precise geographic data that determines location from IP address, GPS coordinates and/or Wi-Fi networks.</p>

<p><b>Mobile App Tracking ("MAT"):</b> MobileAppTracking or “MAT” is a back-end technology that provides unique attribution matching using advertising identifiers and/or statistical identifiers to measure the performance of a mobile ad campaign.</p>

<p><b>MAT SDK:</b> The MAT SDK is computer code inserted into a Developer’s mobile app to enable the Developer to collect Unique Advertising Identifiers and Statistical Identifiers from the user for the purpose of measuring performance.</p>

<p><b>Partners:</b> Partners are third parties that Advertiser clients work with to promote applications, networks, offers, and/or advertisements, including but not limited to: ad networks, publishers, advertisers, affiliates, analytics providers, and data providers.</p>

<p><b>Postbacks:</b> Postbacks are server-to-server communications that allow parties to share information.</p>

<p><b>Statistical Identifiers:</b> Statistical Identifiers are used to provide attribution when Unique Advertising Identifiers are unavailable. Statistical Identification involves the collection of publicly-available HTTP headers from the end user’s device. MAT uses the HTTP headers to probabilistically determine which device is responsible for the Attribution and collects the following data points: country code, device brand, device model, device carrier, IP address, language preference, operating system name, operating system version, user agent (browser type), and timestamp. As such data points frequently change over time, statistical identifiers collected for Attribution are set by default within the MAT system to a 24 hour window. This window cannot be changed. Additional information is available <a href="http://support.mobileapptracking.com/entries/21771055-Device-Fingerprinting-Methodology" title="Device Fingerprinting Methodology" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3><b>WHAT DATA DOES TUNE COLLECT FROM CLIENTS?</b></h3>
<p>Signing up as a MAT client requires the submission of your full name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, credit card information, and website URL. We do not collect data from end users except in rare circumstances when an Advertiser asks MAT to collect email addresses on their behalf. We use all collected  data to service your accounts and respond to inquiries. We hold this data in strict confidence.</p>
<p>We may also collect data about other users you wish to add to your account, such information includes: name, title, office number and email address.</p>

<p>We gather certain data automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp; This data may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.</p>


<h3><b>HOW DOES TUNE USE DATA COLLECTED FROM CLIENTS?</b></h3>
<p>We use the data clients provide us for the following purposes: </p>

<ul>
  <li>To ensure the MAT Website is relevant to end user needs and to make the Website easier for you to use.</li>

We may provide, or enable others to collect, information for purposes of detecting and preventing malicious activity or invalid traffic. We may disclose such information in the event we reasonably suspect malicious activity or invalid traffic, or believe that we are legally required to do so. We may also share aggregated data derived from the MAT Platform, including, for example, statistics about MAT Platform activity. We may share the personal data you provided us with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who work for us and need access to your information to do their work such as providing customer support, processing payments, and storing data.

Finally, we may transfer MAT Platform data to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.</p>

<h3><b>WHAT DATA DO ADVERTISERS COLLECT FROM END USERS WITH MAT?</b></h3>

<p>The MAT Platform is designed to collect and use data such as Unique Advertising Identifiers, Statistical Identifiers, Geographic Location Data, email address, and other data provided by the Advertiser for attribution. When an end user clicks on an advertisement, installs an app, or takes an action inside of an app, the MAT Platform uses the MAT SDK and redirect links to collect information, such as a Unique Advertising Identifier, to perform attribution. The MAT Platform also enables clients to view and measure information provided by TUNE, Advertisers, and the Advertiser’s other partnerships. Advertiser clients and Partners may also send information to the MAT Platform via Postback.</p>
<p>The Platform does not collect names, addresses, phone numbers, or financial information (like credit cards or banking information) from end users.</p>

<h3><b>HOW CAN CLIENTS USE DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE MAT PLATFORM?</b></h3>

<p>The use of data collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the client has engaged TUNE.  Advertiser clients use data collected from end users on the MAT Platform to view reports and data related to their advertising campaigns. The Platform also allows clients to view and utilize the data they collect to optimize their ad campaigns. Advertiser clients may also use the MAT Platform to share their data with Partners—including measurement partners, ad networks, and publishers—via Postback, data exports, and/or API calls.</p>

<p>Advertiser clients may use the data they collect on the MAT Platform for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Measuring the performance of ad campaigns (for example, by comparing the lifetime value of a user against the expenses required to obtain that user).</li>
  <li>Measuring the value of particular end users.</li>
  <li>Measuring the performance of various Partners, including ad networks and publishers.</li>
  <li>Creating customized performance reports (for example, how well a particular advertisement is performing in a particular geographic region).</li>
  <li>Determining when end users respond to ads.</li>
  <li>Cross device attribution. For more details on how MAT measures cross device attribution,&nbsp;<a href="support.mobileapptracking.com/entries/30513204-Measuring-Cross-Device-Attribution?__hstc=232459968.e045c431c68b578c12f6791e12f9dcc8.1421959692049.1423697160830.1423788106145.16&amp;__hssc=232459968.2.1423788106145&amp;__hsfp=1070120208" title="Measuring Cross Device Attribution">click here</a>.</li>
</ul>
