In addition, information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the company.

          </p><p class="start">9. <u>COLLECTION AND USE OF END USER ANALYTICS INFORMATION</u>.  The Platform provides information to you about how your End Users use their mobile applications as well as how applications are performing across different mobile devices (but the Platform does not collect personally identifiable information about your End Users). HasOffers obtains this information as a result of data being sent to our servers from our software "agent" if embedded by you in an End User's mobile application. The data collected by the agent includes: agent version, platform, SDK version, timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, device identifier, e.g., UDID, Model (non-iOS), manufacture (non-iOS) and OS version of device (non-iOS), session start/stop time, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time zone, and network status (WiFi, etc.). The device identifier is hashed to an HasOffers ID. In addition, HasOffers may collect the following data if you select the option for HasOffers to collect and provide such data to HasOffers: anonymous User ID, latitude and longitude (obfuscated by HasOffers for iOS to state/city), events, errors, and page views. Finally, we see the IP address of the user through the HTTP request. HasOffers uses this data to create reports for you to analyze your End Users and to create reports and/or metrics against which you can compare your user base. We may provide you with the option of exporting raw HasOffers data to your servers such as timestamp, platform, event, and user ID. You can also record errors that occur in your applications and receive an export of data containing the error information.
          </p><p>Your End User data collected via analytics is presented to you to analyze your applications. In addition, we provide you with aggregated and anonymous benchmark data that includes your End User data and all other Customers' End User data.
          </p><p class="start">10. <u>END USER OPT-OUT PROVISION</u>.  Your End Users can opt-out of HasOffers Analytics tracking and personalized ads/recommendations from HasOffers by clicking the link provided in the Privacy agreement posted on the Website or by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@hasoffers.com">privacy@hasoffers.com</a>
          </p><p>The opt-out is specific to HasOffers activities and does not affect the activities of other ad networks or analytics providers that you use. If an End User opts-out, HasOffers will stop tracking data for that device identifier going forward. The HasOffers Analytics tracking will stop across all applications. HasOffers will stop providing recommendations to the device identifier across all publishers.
          </p><p>There may be a short delay of up to several business days while your request is being verified, processed and deployed across our system. Please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hasoffers.com">privacy@hasoffers</a> if you have any questions. 
          </p><p class="start">11. <u>CUSTOMER USE OF END DATA</u>.  HasOffers is not responsible for any use by you of any data about your End Users that has or has not been obfuscated and provided by HasOffers. End Users should review your policies to understand your use of End User data. You are prohibited herein from using the Platform, Services or Website to independently collect any personally identifiable information about any End User.  Further, you must provide a privacy agreement to your End Users in which written notice is given to the End Users that they may opt out of HasOffers Analytics tracking by clicking the link provided in the Privacy Policy posted on the Website or by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@hasoffers.com">privacy@hasoffers.com</a>.
