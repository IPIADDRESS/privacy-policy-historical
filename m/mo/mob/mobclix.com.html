Rest assured that we are actively working on updating this Cookies Policy for when our new services are launched.

                      <h3>What are Cookies?</h3>
                      <p>Cookies are text files that contain little amounts of information that Axonix or third parties send to your computer, phone, tablet or other equipment ("deviceï¿½) when you visit our website. If you visit our website again, those cookies are sent back to our website or another one that recognises the cookie, allowing us to recognise your device.</p>
                      
                      <h3>How do we use Cookies?</h3>
                      <p>We use cookies in a few different ways:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>We use some to enable you to browse our website and use all of the different features ï¿½ without them we wonï¿½t be able to offer you all of the services available on our pages. You can decline these if set your browser to, but please remember this might affect the usability of the website.</li>
                        <li>We also have cookies that collect information on how our website is used. This is information such as which pages are visited the most or whether any pages wonï¿½t load. The information collected is anonymous and aggregated and allows us to improve the performance of our website.</li>
                        <li>Another cookie we use is known as the Google Analytics cookie. This is a tracking cookie set by Google and used to collect information about how you use our website. Google use this information for us to compile reports which show us how our website is used. This helps us to improve our website. The cookie collects information in an anonymous form, which means it cannot be linked back to you. It collects information such as the number of visitors using the website, where visitors have come to the website from and what pages they have visited. If you want to read more about Google Analytics, just have a look at their <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" title="Google Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> online.</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <h3>How do I turn off Cookies?</h3>
                      <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to find out the correct way to modify your cookies. But remember, as we mentioned earlier, if you turn cookies off, you may not have access to some of the features that make our website more efficient.</p>
                      
                      <h3>What about web beacons and page tags?</h3>
                      <p>Google Analytics also uses web beacons and page tags. These serve a similar purpose to cookies. A "web beacon" is a clear picture file which keeps track of your navigation through the website.  Turning off the website's cookies as detailed above will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity. The web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address but unique information will not be recorded.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Can I opt out of Google Analytics?</h3>
                      <p>If you wish to opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you can visit <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" title="Google Analytics Website Optout">Google's website</a> and download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Your consent and feedback</h3>
                      <p>By using our website without disabling cookies you are consenting to our use of cookies and web beacons as described in this policy. If you have any questions of feeback concerning this Cookies Policy please drop us an email on <a href="legal@axonix.com" title="legal@axonix.com">legal@axonix.com</a>.</p>
