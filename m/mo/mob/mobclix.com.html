	<p><strong>INFORMATION RETENTION, SECURITY, AND PROTECTION</strong><br>
<br>

    Mobclix, Inc. and its family of businesses store your information, automated personal information, financial information, credit card, and billing information that we collect about you for a minimum of one year from the time of initial submission.  We may retain the information for indefinite periods of time during and for a minimum of one year after the term of your membership for billing purposes. Further, we may use this information for any purpose including but not limited to marketing, billing and/or any other purpose required by applicable law.<br><br>
 
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, alteration, destruction, and disclosure. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information. We use industry standard one-way SHA-256 hash to store all user information.<br>
<br>

Further, only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions; also, we restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who have a "need-to-know" that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services and websites, and who are bound by confidentiality requirements. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.<br><br>

We want you to feel confident using our websites to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>
