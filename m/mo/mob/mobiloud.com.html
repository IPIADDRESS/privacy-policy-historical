<p>Through the MobiLoud service, we, Fifty Pixels Ltd (trading as "MobiLoud"), provide website operators and other individuals with a number of tools, services and assistance (including this website) to enable them to create, publish, and manage mobile applications.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our websites including mobiloud.com, our blog at mobiloud.com/blog and our help site at mobiloud.com/help; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our WordPress plugins, including the News and Canvas plugins; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mobile applications (including the MobiLoud and Canvas demo mobile apps for Android and iOS); </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our app development and publishing services, including all communications with our team; </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website, mobile applications and other products and services collectively as “Services.”</p>
<p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please <a href="mailto:support@mobiloud.com">contact us</a>.</p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>
<p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>
<h4><strong>Information You Provide to Us </strong></h4>
<p>It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Basic Account Information: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a MobiLoud account, request a demo or use one of our WordPress plugins to provide a name and email address and, occasionally, a phone number. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Transaction and Billing Information:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you buy something from us–a subscription to one of our plans or a Lifetime License, you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, company name, credit card information, VAT number and contact information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Credentials: <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use one of our Services, you may decide to provide us with credentials for your website or app, e.g. a WordPress username and password, if you need our help to make any changes on your site, or your iTunes account credentials, for our team to publish your apps.<br>
</span></b></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Information We Collect Automatically </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also collect some information automatically: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Log Information: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you create an account on our website.</span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Information About your Website: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may collect information about your website, such as what theme is in use, or if you're using WooCommerce on your site, in order for us to provide better technical support, suggest appropriate configurations for your app and ensure compatibility with the most used themes and plugins. </span></li>
<li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that you may take when using our website, our mobile applications or our WordPress plugins, e.g. who did what, when and to what thing on a site. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better. </span></li>
<li><b>Location Information: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</span></li>
<li><b>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and e-mails. MobiLoud uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand e-mail campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our </span><a href="https://www.iubenda.com/private/privacy-policy/23762/cookie-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookie Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3>How We Use Information</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account, build your apps or charge you for any of our paid Services;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further develop our Services–for example by adding new features that we think our Users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their apps;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how Users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of MobiLoud and others; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To communicate with you about offers and promotions offered by MobiLoud and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on MobiLoud and our products; and </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Sharing Information</h3>
<h4>How We Share Information</h4>
<p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information.</p>
<p>We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Third Party Vendor</b><strong>s</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information) and those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers). We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>As Required by Law: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>To Protect Rights and Property: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MobiLoud, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Business Transfer</b><strong>s</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that MobiLoud goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>With Your Consent:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Aggregated and De-Identified Information: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Published Support Requests</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.</p>
<h3>Choices</h3>
<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Limit the Information that You Provide:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, you will not be able to make full use of our Services. </span></b></li>
<li><b>Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices. </span></b></li>
<li><strong>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, MobiLoud does not respond to “do not track” signals. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using MobiLoud’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of MobiLoud’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Other Things You Should Know</h3>
<h4>Transferring Information</h4>
<p>MobiLoud is a worldwide service. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, which may have rights and protections that are different from those in your home country.</p>
<h4>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h4>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by MobiLoud and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.</p>
<h4>Third Party Software</h4>
<p>If you’d like to use third party services like plugins, SDKs, crash logging, advertising and analytics tools with our Services, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself to those third parties. We don’t own or control these third parties and they have their own rules about collection, use and sharing of information. You should review their rules and policies when installing and using third party software.</p>
<h4>Our Customers’ Apps</h4>
<p>If you are a user to one of our Users’ apps please note that this privacy policy doesn’t apply to you in regard to that specific app. We process limited information that users provide to our Users’ apps on behalf of our Users and in accordance with our <a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions</a>. We encourage our Users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information.</p>
