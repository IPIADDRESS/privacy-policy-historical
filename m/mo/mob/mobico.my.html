        <p>This information governs your use of the software application (please insert application name) ("Application") for mobile devices that was created by Macro Mobile Services Sdn. Bhd. In this information, "Macro Mobile Services Sdn. Bhd. "may also be referred as "We" or "Us".
		<br><br>
		<b>Automatically Collected Information</b>
		<br><br>
		We respect the privacy rights of our users and we do not collect any personal information from your device or account. Anonymous usage statistics are collected and stored temporarily on Google Analytics servers for the sole purpose of improving our games and applications. We collect information about the number of times a certain level is started, the high score and similar metrics including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the Application. The data we collect can in no way be associated with a specific user or device.
		<br><br>
		<b>Customer Support</b>
		<br><br>
		When you ask for support, we will collect and store the contact information you provide and information about your inquiry or activity. We will also store the correspondence and any information contained within.
		<br><br>
		<b>Payment Information</b>
		<br><br>
		All billing and financial information is processed by third-parties (e.g., Microsoft, Apple, Google). We do not process, store or share any billing information.
		<br><br>
		<b>In-app Purchases</b>
		<br><br>
		Although the download of the Application may be offered for free, some additional content can be purchased for real money in-app. Such purchases do not always require the re-entry of credit card information because they may be made through an existing third-party account (such as an Microsoft, Google, Amazon or iTunes account). If you do not want to use this feature, turn off in-app purchases in your device's settings. To learn how to disable in-app purchases, refer to the device manufacturer.
		<br><br>
		Additional content is offered "as is" and by making in-app purchases you, or anyone using your device and/or credentials, are responsible for any financial transactions and you agree that We will not be held responsible for any loss, material or otherwise. We reserve the right to deny refunding requests for in-app purchases in cases of negligence to the terms stated here in this agreement.

Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information collected by the Application and may also obtain anonymous information.

For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Application. Please be aware that, although we endeavour provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
