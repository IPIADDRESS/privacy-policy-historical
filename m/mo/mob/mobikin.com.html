<p><strong>2.1 The Collection of Personal Information: </strong></p>
<p>- Communications between Us: Once you contact us via email or letter,   you  might be required to provide us with your specific information    in the message;</p>
<p>- Technical Support: When you telephone or email us for a technical    assistance or product consulting, you may need to provide your personal   information  before getting the answer;</p>

<p>- Purchases: We also collect user information during the purchasing   process.  Nonetheless, this information is collected from the registered   e-commerce  provider- MyCommerce with our authorization;</p>

Sometimes you may need to install App to apply for    authorization on the mobile terminal. But no matter you use which   software, our  products would only apply for your mobile phone access to   let you manage the  device more smoothly. We won't record or save the   Personal Information on your  computer or mobile phone.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 The Use of Collected Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>- This collected data might be transferred to recipients which are located outside the European Union. These destinations may not have the law like GDPR to protect the user's personal data so well;</p>
<p>-  MobiKin would transfer the collected information to some companies that help us to run our business by processing personal information on behalf of us for the purposes mentioned above, such as the providers of payment processing services, server services providers, data analysis services providers, email delivery service providers, fraud monitoring and prevention providers, etc.;</p>
<p>-   MobiKin may post some comments  as testimonials. These testimonials might contain your personal information. But we will obtain your consent before posting your comments;</p>
<p>-  We would analyze the collected data to evaluate and improve our products, services, marketing and customer relationships;</p>
<p>- MobiKin might store the information on the servers leased from providers of third party server service;</p>
<p>- We would remove your information from MobiKin after receiving your request. But we might keep some of your information for legitimate business interests (including fraud detection and prevention) and to comply with our legal obligations (including tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations);</p>
<p>-  Once the payment has been processed and has become effective, your banking information will be deleted but the withdrawal time period could additionally apply. Your credit card number and its expiration date (not the CVV security code) could be stored through intermediary archives for evidence purposes in case of a claim regarding payment.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Disclosure of the Data</strong></p>
<p>All the data that we collect  are  necessary for our   service and we would start the collection with your  agreement. After   getting the information, we won't share them with others  except the following  situations:</p>
<p>- We may share your information with our partners who adhere to this policy and service providers who assist us in meeting business operation needs;</p>

<p>- We have to transfer all or some of your information to another entity when we are facing a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization, sale of some or all of our assets or stock, public offering of securities or steps in consideration of such activities.</p>
<p><strong>4. Data Breaches </strong></p>
<p>All breaches, expect for the data that was anonymized, encrypted or has a particularly high risk, will be reported to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours. If the staff, contractors or officers of MobiKin violate this policy, they will be dealt with under the company's grievance and disciplinary policy and may lead to a disciplinary sanction.</p>
<p>When MobiKin learns a security system breach, if available, we would try to send an email or post a notice on the website to prompt you and provide information on protective steps. If possible, you may even have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.</p>
