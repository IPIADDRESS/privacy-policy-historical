Customers Does Domain Acres Gather?</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#9C8D7C" size="2"><b>Information You Give Us:</b></font><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2<br">
        We receive and store any information you enter on our Web
        site or give us in any other way. We use the information
        that you provide for such purposes as responding to your
        requests, providing our services (e.g., domain name
        registration, DNS hosting), and communicating with you.<br>
        <br>
        </font>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#9C8D7C" size="2"><b>Automatic Information:</b></font><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2"> We
        receive and store certain types of information whenever
        you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites,
        we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types
        of information when your Web browser accesses our sites.
        Examples of the information we collect and analyze
        include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to
        connect your computer to the Internet; computer and
        connection information such as browser type and version,
        operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource
        Locators (URL) click stream to, through, and from our Web
        site, including date and time. We use IP addresses to
        analyze trends, administer the site, track user's
        movement, and gather broad demographic information for
        aggregate use. </font>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#027B82" size="2"><b>What About Cookies? </b></font></p>

<ul>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2">Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers
        that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through
        your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your
        browser. Besides using the information as described
        above, Domain Acres utilizes cookies to control the flow
        of the ordering processes by maintaining the state of
        your online transactions.<br>
        <br>
        Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site
        (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to
        or control over these cookies. </font>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#027B82" size="2"><b>Does Domain Acres Share the Information
It Receives?</b></font></p>
<!--"Domain Acres - Virtual Real Estate" - Cheap Webhosting and Domain Registration and Domain Reseller selling business domain names, a domain name broker.-->
<!--This webpage is copyright protected - Domain Acres - all rights reserved-->
<ul>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2">Yes, we do share information but only
        as described below. Otherwise we will not provide your
        personal information without your consent. </font>
</ul>

<ul>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#9C8D7C" size="2"><b>WHOIS:</b></font><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2"> We are required by the
        Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
        ("ICANN"), the organization that assumes
        responsibility for domain name allocation, to collect
        information about you during the domain name registration
        process. This information includes your full name,
        mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where
        provided, your facsimile number. ICANN then requires all
        registrars to make your full name, mailing address, phone
        number, email address, and, where provided, your
        facsimile number, as well as the creation and expiration
        dates of your domain name registration and the name
        server information associated with your domain name, to
        the public via an interactive Web page and a "port
        43" WHOIS service. For the purposes of this Privacy
        Notice we will refer to this information as your
        "WHOIS Information." Please note that we may
        not be able to control how members of the public may use
        the WHOIS Information.<br>
        <br>
        </font>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#9C8D7C" size="2"><b>Advertisers:</b></font><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2"> We will share
        aggregated demographic information with our partners and
        advertisers. This is not linked to any personal
        information that can identify any individual person.<br>
        <br>
        </font>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#9C8D7C" size="2"><b>Partners:</b></font><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2"> We partner with other
        parties to provide specific services. When the user signs
        up for these services, we will share names, or other
        contact information that is necessary for the third party
        to provide these services.<br>
        <br>
        </font>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#9C8D7C" size="2"><b>Agents:</b></font><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2"> We engage other
        companies and individuals to perform functions on our
        behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments,
        providing marketing assistance, providing customer
        services, sending postal mail and email to you, removing
        repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing
        data. These persons have access to personal information
        needed to perform their functions. These companies do not
        retain, share, store or use personally identifiable
        information that you provide to Domain Acres for any
        secondary purposes.<br>
        <br>
        </font>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#9C8D7C" size="2"><b>Service Providers:</b></font><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2"> We engage
        other companies and individuals to perform enhanced
        services on our behalf. For example, we have engaged
        Critical Path, Inc. to provide free electronic mail
        services to our domain name registrants. In addition,
        certain of our enhanced services such as our Web Site
        Generator require that we contact Internet directories
        and various search engines on your behalf. Many of our
        service providers have access to personal information
        needed to perform their services. These parties are not
        allowed to use personally identifiable information except
        for the purpose of providing these services.<br>
        <br>
        </font>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#9C8D7C" size="2"><b>Business Transfer:</b></font><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2"> As we
        continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
        businesses or their assets. In such transactions,
        customer information generally is one of the transferred
        business assets. Also, if Domain Acres or all or
        substantially all of its assets were ever to be acquired,
        customer information will of course be one of the
        transferred assets.<br>
        <br>
        </font>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#9C8D7C" size="2"><b>Compliance:</b></font><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2"> We release account
        and other personal information when we believe release is
        appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our
        Services Agreement and other agreements; or protect the
        rights, property, or safety of Domain Acres, our users,
        or others. This includes exchanging information with
        other companies and organizations for fraud protection
        and credit risk reduction. </font>

<p><font face="Arial,Verdana" color="#027B82" size="2"><b>How Secure Is Information About Me?</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2">We work to protect the security of
        your information during transmission by using Secure
        Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information
        you input and the information we may send to our agents. </font>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2">Domain Acres has gone to great lengths
        to ensure your information is securely obtained and held
        in compliance with the Card Holder Information Security
        Program. For example, we encrypt your credit card number
        before it is stored in our database. This ensures that no
        one may access your credit card from our system. </font>
    <font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2">It is important for you to protect
        against unauthorized access to your password and to your
        computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a
        shared computer.<br>

        certain information about you for the limited purpose of
        viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.
