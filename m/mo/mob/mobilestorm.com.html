		<h4>What Basic Information Does mobileStorm Collect?</h4>
		<p>You can visit the Web site to read information about our company, products, and services without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. In operating the Web site, mobileStorm includes optional information request forms such as White Paper or Webinar Request forms, Newsletter subscription forms, and general contact request forms that request your name, company, title, phone number, email address, URL, address and other information to help us determine your needs related to our products and solutions and in order for you to download or view documents or other information through the mobileStorm Web site. We use this information to send updates about our company and to contact you if requested or necessary.  mobileStorm also collects billing information such as credits and eCheck data via our partner Authorize.net.

This information is provided by you on a voluntary basis only and is not required by us in order for you to use and enjoy the Web site.  mobileStorm uses the information that we collect on the Web site to contact you to further discuss your interest in our company, our services, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as marketing promotions and events. This information may also be used to improve the services we provide you.   We use this information to improve the way that we provide our services to our clients, to relay administrative information, and to verify login information.  The information is collected and stored in a manner that is appropriate for the nature of the data that we collect, and the need to fulfill your request. mobileStorm does not share, sell, rent, or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>		
		<h4>Tell-A-Friend</h4>
		<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  mobileStorm stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>		
		<h4>mobileStorm Clients</h4>
		<p>If you are a client of mobileStorm (or work on behalf of a mobileStorm client), through our secure web interface we also collect your username and password, and any other information that you provide to us on behalf of the client that you are representing pursuant to the terms of a license or other agreement between the applicable client and mobileStorm (the “Client Agreement”). You should refer to that Client Agreement in addition to this Privacy Policy with regard to your use of the mobileStorm Web site and mobileStorm’s privacy obligations.</p>
		<h4>Automatic Collection</h4>
		<p>Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet), domain names, the activity of the visitor’s browser when the visitor is viewing the Web site; the site path of visitors; the time visitors come to the Web site and length of visit.  No personal information about you is revealed in the process.  The Web site may also gather anonymous traffic data that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer and mobileStorm reserves the right to publish such anonymous, aggregate summary information regarding its visitors for promotional purposes.</p>
		<p>mobileStorm uses "cookies" and "web beacons" to collect data. A cookie is a small text file containing a random and unique identifier that either mobileStorm or its third party web analytics provider on behalf of mobileStorm  transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser (unless you set your browser to reject cookies) that enables mobileStorm or its third party web analytics provider’s system to recognize your browser.  mobileStorm uses cookies to track your movement through the Web site and verify the login status of client using products or services linked directly within the mobileStorm Web site.

		<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
		<p>mobileStorms’ web site uses security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We store the information in two redundant databases in two secure environments at different locations with our data hosting service provider, Savvis Communications.</p>
		<p>mobileStorm takes care to reinforce the importance of our web site visitors’ security and privacy among our employees. mobileStorm requires unique usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a user logs on to mobileStorm’s client interface. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of all data. The bottom line is that, because our business involves hosting application accounts, data security is paramount. We’re constantly reevaluating and deploying new technologies to enhance our security.</p>
		<p>In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets.  In such transactions, visitor information may be one of the transferred assets.  In the event that all or substantially all of mobileStorm’s assets are acquired in a transaction, our visitor information may be an asset that is reviewed and transferred.   Such a transaction will be disclosed per the "Notification of Privacy Policy Changes" guidelines above. Also, as with the data we collect on behalf of our clients, we reserve the right to disclose any data we collect at our Web site if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority or to protect the health and safety of mobileStorm’s employees or the general public.</p>
		<p>mobileStorm is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites to which we link. We encourage our visitors to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that they visit.</p>
		<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  To learn more about SSL, follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer" rel="external" title="Secure Sockets Layer">this link</a>.</p>
		<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
