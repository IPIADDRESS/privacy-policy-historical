                These modules may collect your Advertising Identifiers (IDFA), and the collected information will not be tied to any other information nor be used to identify each individual. Advertising Identifier (IDFA) is a non-permanent, non-personalized identifier similar to that of Android advertising ID and Apple’s Advertising ID.

                The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain appropriate technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction or loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, use and all other unlawful forms of processing of the data in our possession. We take commercially reasonable security measures to protect your personal information. Among others, we employ following security measures:
                <br><br>
                <ul class="co_policy_list">
                  <li>(a) We encrypt many of our services using SSL and MD5 which are most common encryption technologies;</li>
                  <li>(b) We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems by using our security systems such as Firewalls and IDSs (intrusion detection systems);</li>
                  <li>(c) We restrict access to personal information to our company’s employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                However, unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
