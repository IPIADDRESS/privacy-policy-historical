              data, which is sent to the browser of the concerned user by a web 
              server and stored on the hard disk of his computer. All services 
              proposed by MOBIPOCKET.COM may require the user to accept "cookies". 
              The user may intervene regarding "cookies": by amending 
              the parameters of his computer, he may accept all the "cookies", 
              receive notice of the operating of a "cookie", or reject 
              all the "cookies". In the case of this last option, the 
              user shall not have the possibility to use MOBIPOCKET.COM products 
              and services. MOBIPOCKET.COM indicates to the user upon the collection 
              or transfer of the data if his personal information is likely to

              not to use a particular product or service or not to participate

              services; - to assess the audience size of MOBIPOCKET.COM. Each

              statistic purposes, so as to propose its services to partners, advertisers 
              and other possible partners. In addition, MOBIPOCKET.COM may have 
              to disclose confidential information under specific circumstances,

              person likely to be harmed by such activities. MOBIPOCKET.COM may 
              generally disclose personal information under any circumstances

              regarding products and services likely to arouse the user's interest, 
              only in the case where the user has indicated upon registration 
              his desire to receive offers or information from MOBIPOCKET.COM

              with acknowledgement of receipt or by any other equivalent means 
              and has to provide a proof of his identity. Under any circumstances,
