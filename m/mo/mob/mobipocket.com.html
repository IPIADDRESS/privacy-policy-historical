              data, which is sent to the browser of the concerned user by a web 
              server and stored on the hard disk of his computer. All services 
              proposed by MOBIPOCKET.COM may require the user to accept "cookies". 
              The user may intervene regarding "cookies": by amending 
              the parameters of his computer, he may accept all the "cookies", 
              receive notice of the operating of a "cookie", or reject 
              all the "cookies". In the case of this last option, the 
              user shall not have the possibility to use MOBIPOCKET.COM products 
              and services. MOBIPOCKET.COM indicates to the user upon the collection 
              or transfer of the data if his personal information is likely to

              not to use a particular product or service or not to participate 
              to certain promotions. "Cookies" are generally used by

              logs in and is modified when the user logs out from MOBIPOCKET.COM 
              services; - to assess the audience size of MOBIPOCKET.COM. Each
