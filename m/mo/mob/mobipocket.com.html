              data, which is sent to the browser of the concerned user by a web 
              server and stored on the hard disk of his computer. All services 
              proposed by MOBIPOCKET.COM may require the user to accept "cookies". 
              The user may intervene regarding "cookies": by amending 
              the parameters of his computer, he may accept all the "cookies", 
              receive notice of the operating of a "cookie", or reject 
              all the "cookies". In the case of this last option, the 
              user shall not have the possibility to use MOBIPOCKET.COM products

              not to use a particular product or service or not to participate
