<td valign="top" align="left" width="100%"><h1>PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
<p>
This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices of MobyGames,
http://www.mobygames.com.
</p><p></p><h2>Information Collection and Use</h2><p></p><p>
MobyGames is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We
will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different
from what is disclosed in this statement.  MobyGames collects information
from our users at several different points on our website.
</p><p></p><h2>Registration</h2>
<p>
In order to use MobyGames to its fullest extent, a user must first complete
the registration form.  During registration a user is required to give their
contact information (such as name and email address).  This information is
used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have
expressed interest.  MobyGames will not sell or share this information with
anyone.  It is optional for the user to provide demographic information
(such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social
security number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized
experience on our site.
</p><p></p><h2>User Contributions</h2>
<p>
Non-personal voluntarily-contributed information and data, including but not limited to reviews, articles, game entries, box and screen images, is the
property of MobyGames.  MobyGames reserves the right to sell, license, share
or rent this information and data.
</p><p></p><h2>Order</h2>
<p>
MobyGames may in the future conduct sales transactions.  We will request
information from the user on our order form.  Here a user must provide
contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial
information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is
used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.  If we have trouble
processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with
the user.
</p><p></p><h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing
information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any
personally identifiable information while on our site.  For instance, by
setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password
more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects
the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that
the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user
will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or
monthly Drawings that may take place. Cookies can also enable us to track
and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
</p><p></p><p>
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example,
advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
</p><p></p><h2>Log Files</h2><p></p><p>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's
movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP
addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
</p><p></p><h2>Sharing</h2><p></p><p>
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and
advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can
identify any individual person.
</p><p></p><h2>Links</h2><p></p><p>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we
MobyGames are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the
privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally
identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to
information collected by this Web site.
</p><p></p><h2>Newsletter</h2><p></p><p>
MobyGames may in the future produce a newsletter.  Users wishing to subscribe to this newsletter have control over their subscription status via their user account settings.
</p><p></p><h2>Surveys &amp; Contests</h2><p></p><p>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or
contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely
voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose
this information.  Information requested may include contact information
(such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as
zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the
winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of
monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
</p><p></p><h2>Tell-A-Friend</h2><p></p><p>
MobyGames may in the future use a referral service.  If a user elects to use
this future referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask
them for the friend's name and email address.  MobyGames will automatically
send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  MobyGames
stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
The friend may contact MobyGames at moby@mobygames.com to request the
removal of this information from their database.
</p><p></p><h2>Security</h2><p></p><p>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When
users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is
protected both online and off-line.
</p><p></p><p>
All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information, is
restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to
perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable
information.  Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when
they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password
to re-gain access to your information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept
up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as
any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded
about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our
customers' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store
personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment,
behind a locked cage.
</p><p></p><p>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an
email to moby@mobygames.com.
</p><p>
</p><h2>Special Offers</h2><p></p><p>
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username.
Established members will occasionally receive information on products,
services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of
our users we present the option to not receive these types of
communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.
</p><p></p><h2>Site and Service Updates</h2><p></p><p>
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not
able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important
information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide
requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via
email or phone.
</p><p></p><h2>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</h2><p></p><p>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip
code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to
provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data
provided to us.  This can usually be done at the member information page or
by emailing our Customer Support.  
</p><p></p><h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2><p></p><p>
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information
used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask
for the information.  For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism
so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material,
can keep their email address off of our lists.
</p><p></p><p>
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials
from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying
to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at
mobygames@mobygames.com.
</p><p>
</p><p>
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being
collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an
informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require
an outside party, or not.
</p><p></p><h2>Notification of Changes</h2><p></p><p>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our
Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how
we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point
we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different
from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way
of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their
information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance
with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
