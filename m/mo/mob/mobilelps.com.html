<p>This privacy policy tells you how we collect, use, and protect your personal information. By visiting our website, you accept and agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. In particular, you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this privacy policy.</p>

If you are a minor, please do not provide us or other website visitors with any personal information.</p>
<p><strong>POLICY IS PART OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</strong></p>
<p>Our privacy policy is part of, and subject to, our website’s terms and conditions of use. You may view these terms and conditions on our website.</p>
<p><strong>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</strong></p>

This includes basic information such as your IP address, when you visited, the website from where you came prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you leave our website, your computer’s operating system, and the type of web browser that you are using. Our website automatically records this basic information about you.</p>
<p>And like many other websites, we may use cookies. In plain English, this means information that our website’s server transfers to your computer. This information can be used to track your session on our website. Cookies may also be used to customize our website content for you as an individual. If you are using one of the common Internet web browsers, you can set up your browser to either let you know when you receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.</p>
