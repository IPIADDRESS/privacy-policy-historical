                    <hr>

                    <strong>Last Updated: 2-6-2013</strong>

                    <br><br>

                    <p>
                        Thank you for your interest in Motive Interactive, Inc. (referred to herein as “Motive Interactive,”
                        “we” or “us”) and our website located at http://new.motiveinteractive.com (the “Site”). We are
                        pleased to provide this privacy policy to inform you of our practices with respect to how we collect
                        and use Personal Information (defined below) about visitors to the Site. By using this Site, you
                        consent to the following terms.
                    </p>What We Collect
                    <p>
                        The data that we regularly collect about visitors to our Site (e.g., IP address, browser type, pages
                        accessed, duration of visit, etc.) does not necessarily enable us to personally identify you, and
                        that is not our intention. We do collect personally identifiable information about you (“Personal
                        Information”), including without limitation, your name, billing address, mailing address, email
                        address, gender, how you like to receive email messages, age, interests, and credit card information (if
                        needed to process an order placed by you), but only if you voluntarily provide it to us, for example, by
                        registering, placing an order, participating in one of our programs and/or requesting information from
                        us. Further, if you communicate with us, we may keep all such correspondence as part of your user
                        account.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cookies</h3>
                    <p>
                        To facilitate your use of the Site, Motive Interactive uses “cookies.” A cookie is a small amount of
                        data that Motive Interactive’s servers transfer to your browser and that only Motive Interactive’s
                        servers can read. When you log onto the Site, the cookie file captures your username, unique session
                        identifier number and other session data to enable you to traverse through this website’s various
                        screens without having to authenticate yourself at each new screen. Motive Interactive uses cookies
                        to understand general information on site traffic trends such as most frequently visited pages. If you
                        do not wish to utilize cookies, you may disable or delete them from within your Internet browser
                        application by accessing the security or privacy settings. You may, however, be required to have
                        cookies enabled to access certain portions of the Site or participate in our programs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Use of Information</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>General Uses</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Motive Interactive uses your Personal Information primarily to provide products and services that
                            you have requested, to send promotional information, and to enhance the operation of our site and
                            administer our systems. Personal Information is also used to verify your authority to access the
                            Site. Motive Interactive may also use any information you have entered into the Site as reasonably
                            necessary to administer or provide customer support for the Site.
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Promotional Uses</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Motive Interactive may also store and use your Personal Information for our own mailing and
                            database purposes, and to send you information related to your interest areas and from other pre-
                            screened companies that have products that we believe may be of interest to you. If you would like to
                            opt-out of having your information used for marketing purposes by Motive Interactive, please see the
                            “How to Opt-Out” section below for instructions on how to inform us of this choice.
                        </dd>

                    <h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        Motive Interactive uses certain third party vendors (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) to
                        assist us in providing our products and services. Motive Interactive may transfer your Personal
                        Information to such vendors for their use as necessary to fulfill their contracts with Motive Interactive.
                        We may also disclose your Personal Information as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply
                        with law, regulation or other governmental authority or to prevent harm to yourself or others.
                        Your Personal Information may also be disclosed upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or
                        substantially all of our stock or assets in the line of business to which this privacy policy relates or
                        upon any other corporate reorganization. We may also disclose your Personal Information to third
                        parties that we believe may be of interest to you for their own marketing purposes, including without
                        limitation, bringing you select retail opportunities via direct mail, email and telemarketing. Motive
                        Interactive may also use trusted third party business partners (“Partners”) to host short surveys or
                        offer forms on the Motive Interactive Site and affiliated sites. When you select an offer, we may
                        pre-populate Personal Information in these forms to make it easier for you to get information about
                        various special offers and services. If you agree to participate in an offer hosted by Motive Interactive
                        or our Partners, your Personal Information included in the form will be transmitted to the appropriate
                        advertiser referenced in the survey or offer.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How to Opt-Out</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you do not wish your information shared with third parties by Motive Interactive for marketing
                        purposes, you may opt-out of such disclosure by notifying Motive Interactive using the contact
                        information provided below. Upon opting-out, Motive Interactive will not make further disclosures
                        of your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes. Please allow up to seven (7)
                        business days to be completely opted-out from such use. Keep in mind that if you take advantage of
                        an offer from a Motive Interactive business partner, they may independently wish to send offers to
                        you. In the event that you wish to opt-out of receiving future offers from these third parties, you must
                        contact them directly to make such a request.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How You Can Change, Correct and Update Your Information</h3>
                    <p>

                        the Edit My Preferences page on the Site and making your desired changes.

                    <h3>Links</h3>
                    <p>
                        In connection with the Site, we may provide links to certain third party websites or referrals to certain
                        third parties’ products or services. If you choose to visit a third party’s website or use its products
                        or services, please be aware that these third parties’ policies with respect to privacy, and not the

                        interacting with these third parties. Motive Interactive does not bear any responsibility for any actions
                        or policies of such third party websites, including those that are framed within the Site.

                        No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we
                        cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your
                        own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our
                        systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information will not be accessed,
                        disclosed, altered or destroyed, despite these efforts.
                    </p>

                    <h3>No Collection of Information From Children</h3>
