            MotorcycleUSA.com, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected 
            on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to 
            others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>ORDER</b><br>
            We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user 
            must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) 
            and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). 
            This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's 
            orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information 
            is used to get in touch with the user. <br>
            <br>
            <b>COOKIES</b><br>
            A Cookie is a piece of information that a Web site transfers to an 
            individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make 
            Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and 
            preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an Industry 
            standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites. <br>
            <br>
            <b>EXAMPLES OF HOW MOTORCYCLEUSA.COM USES COOKIES </b><br>
            The MotorcycleUSA.com bulletin board uses cookies to store the following 
            information: the last time you logged in, your username and password, 
            and your preferred "topic view", if you set it in preferences. 
            These cookies are stored on your browser. Also, you need to have cookies 
            enabled in your browser if you want to enter a private forum or shop 
            in our Superstore. Also, MotorcycleUSA.com Inc. also uses cookies 
            to let the computer remember that you've registered, which allows 
            us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Cookies are not 
            used to track your movement or perform any function other than to 
            enhance your use of our site. If a user rejects cookies or their browser 
            does not support cookies, they may still use our site, but the user 
            will be limited in some areas of our site and will not be able to 
            purchase items through our Superstore. <br>
            <br>
            <b>LOG FILES</b><br>
            We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track 
            user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate 
            use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>SHARING</b><br>
            We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners 
            and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that 
            can identify any individual person. <br>
            We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card 
            processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies 
            do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information 
            for any secondary purposes. <br>
            We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the 
            user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact 
            information that is necessary for the third party to provide these 
            services. <br>
            These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information 
            except for the purpose of providing these services. <br>
            <br>
            <b>LINKS</b><br>
            This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that 
            we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 
            We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to 
            read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects 
            personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies 
            solely to information collected by this Web site. <br>
            <br>
            <b>NEWSLETTER</b><br>
            If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact 
            information such as name and email address. <br>
            <br>
            <b>SURVEY &amp; CONTESTS</b><br>
            From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys 
            or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely 
            voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose 
            this information. Information requested may include contact information 
            (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such 
            as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify 
            the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for 
            purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this 
            site. <br>
            <br>
            <b>TELL-A-FRIEND</b><br>
            If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend 
            about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. 
            We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them 
            to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose 
            of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact MotorcycleUSA.com, 
            Inc at <a href="mailto:privacy@motorcycle-usa.com">privacy@motorcycleusa.com</a> 
            to request the removal of this information from our database. <br>
            <br>
            <b>SECURITY POLICY</b><br>
            The importance of security for all personally identifiable information 
            associated with our Guests is of utmost concern. We exercise great 
            care in providing secure transmission of your information from your 
            PC to our servers, utilizing encryption software. Only those employees 
            who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are 
            allowed access, each having signed compressive nondisclosure agreements, 
            which provides explicit legal confidentiality protections. Any employee 
            who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary 
            action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution. 
            <br>
            If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can 
            send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@motorcycle-usa.com">privacy@motorcycleusa.com</a>. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>SPECIAL OFFERS</b><br>
            We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. 
            Established members will occasionally receive information on products, 
            services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the 
            privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types 
            of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. <br>
            <br>
            <b>SITE &amp; SERVICE UPDATES</b><br>
            We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members 
            are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain 
            important information about the service. We communicate with the user 
            to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to 
            their account via email or phone. <br>
            <br>
            <b>CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your 
            zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor 
            to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal 
            data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information 
            page or by emailing our Customer Support. <br>
            <br>
            <b>CHOICE/OPT-OUT</b><br>
            Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information 
            used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where 
            we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' 
            mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing 
            material, can keep their email address off of our lists. <br>
            Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional 
            materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications 
            by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email 
            us at <a href="mailto:privacy@motorcycle-usa.com">privacy@motorcycle-usa.com</a>.<br>
            Users of our site are always notified when their information is being 
            collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make 
            an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services 
            that require an outside party, or not. <br>
