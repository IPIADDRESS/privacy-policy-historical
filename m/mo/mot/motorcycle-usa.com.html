<p><strong>3.4 Information Sharing</strong><br>
When you access or use the Services, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal data as described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p><strong>European Union or EEA Member States</strong><br>
If you are located in the European Union or EEA Member States, The Companies will not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal data to third parties without your express consent.</p>
<p><strong>Outside of the European Union or EEA Member States</strong><br>
The Companies will not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your private personal data to third parties without your consent or another valid legal basis permitted by law. The Companies will share your information in the following circumstances on the legal basis of the legitimate interests of providing the requested Services:</p>
<p><strong>Within The Companies:</strong>&nbsp;We may share and process information internally within The Companies and with our subsidiaries and affiliates. The Companies’ personnel may have access to your information as needed to provide and operate the Services in the normal course of business. This includes information regarding your use and interaction with the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliated Businesses:</strong>&nbsp;The Companies is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them for a variety of purposes, including assisting us to perform and improve the Services. These businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or, with your consent, offer promotions (including email promotions) to you. The Companies may also provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses, including providing information to such partners to allow them to more effectively market to you. When an affiliated business assists in facilitating your transaction, we may need to share information related to the transaction with that affiliated business in order to facilitate your transaction, and this forms part of the Services we provide in accordance with our Terms of Use. We rely on your consent (which can be withdrawn at any time) to send marketing messages.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers:</strong>&nbsp;The Companies work with various organizations and individuals to help provide the Services to you (“Service Providers”), such as website and data hosting companies and companies providing analytics information, like Google Analytics. The Companies need to engage such third-party Service Providers to help us operate, provide, and market the Services. These third parties have only limited access to your information and may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf. Information we share to our Service Providers may include both information you provide to us and information we collect about you, including personal data and information from data collection tools like cookies, web beacons, and log files.</p>
<p>The Companies take reasonable steps to ensure that our Service Providers are obligated to reasonably protect your information on The Companies’ behalf. If The Companies become aware that a Service Provider is using or disclosing information improperly, we will take commercially reasonable steps to end or correct such improper use or disclosure.</p>
<p>We share personal data with our Service Providers on the legal basis of The Companies’ legitimate interests in providing you with the Services. Our engagement of Service Providers is often necessary for us to provide the Services to you, particularly where such companies play important roles like helping us keep our Services operating and secure. In some other cases, these service providers aren’t strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but help us make it better, like by helping us conduct research into how we could better serve our users. In these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with service providers to make our Services better.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Technologies:</strong>&nbsp;Third-party plug-ins also may collect information about your use of the Services. For example, when you load a page on The Companies that has a social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a “Like” or “Send” button, you are also loading content from that third-party site. That site may request cookies directly from your browser. These interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the third-party site. In addition, certain cookies and other similar technologies on the Services are used by third parties for targeted online marketing and other purposes. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile device each time you use the Services. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services. The Companies chooses and manages these third-party technologies placed on its Services. However, these are third-party technologies, and they are subject to that third party’s privacy policy. We rely on your consent to drop and read non-technically necessary cookies. The Companies are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transactions:</strong>&nbsp;The Companies may purchase other businesses or their assets, sell our business assets, or be involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets (a “<strong>Business Transaction</strong>”). Your information, including personal data, may be among assets sold or transferred as part of a Business Transaction. In some cases, The Companies may choose to buy or sell assets. Such transactions may be necessary and in our legitimate interests, particularly our interest in making decisions that enable our organization to develop over the long term.</p>
<p><strong>Safety and Lawful Requests:</strong>&nbsp;We may be required to disclose Services user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We generally do not disclose user information unless we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. We may share your information when we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable laws, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Services or using The Companies name, or to protect the safety of any person. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents, or government agencies. Nothing in this Privacy Notice is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated Non-Personal Data:</strong>&nbsp;We may disclose aggregated, non-personal data received from providing the Services, including information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. The Companies may share demographic information with business partners, but it will be aggregated and de-personalized, so that personal data is not revealed.</p>
<p><strong>4. Public Forums &amp; Community</strong><br>
The Companies offer various communities and forums across the Services. We offer several features that allow users to connect and communicate in public or semi-public spaces as part of these Services. You don’t have to use these features, but if you do, please use common sense and good judgment when posting in these community spaces or sharing your personal data with others through the Services.</p>
<p>Please be aware that any personal data that you choose to submit there can be read, collected, or used by others, or could be used to send unsolicited messages to you. We may engage certain third parties and Service Providers to assist in providing community services to you and, in the context of that relationship, we need to share some of your information with such third parties in order to provide that service. The Companies generally does not control or remove content from public Services spaces, and your posts may remain public after your account is closed. You are responsible for the personal data that you choose to post in public Services spaces.</p>
<p>Please also note we may automatically collect certain information about you when you browse or post to the communities and forums, such as your computer’s IP address or a device identification number.</p>

The Companies implements security measures as we deem appropriate and consistent with industry standards.

Accordingly, any information you transfer to or from Services are provided at your own risk.</p>
<p>Please do your part to help us keep your information secure. Services Account information is protected by a password.

<p><strong>7. Additional Provisions Regarding The Services &amp; Your Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.1 Transfer And Storage Of Your Information</strong><br>
The United States, European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”) Member States, and other countries all have different laws relating to privacy and data protection. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal data in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live. For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal data may vary from country to country. In particular, if your information is in the United States, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with U.S. law.</p>
<p>Please be advised information The Companies collects about you via the Services may be transferred, processed and/or accessed by us in the United States, or another country where we, or our Service Providers operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal data, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. If you are located outside the United States and choose to allow us to collect information about you, please be aware that The Companies may transfer your personal data to the United States and process and store it there. We will transfer personal data only to those countries to which we are permitted by law to transfer personal data, and we will take steps to ensure that your personal data continues to enjoy appropriate protections.</p>
<p><strong>7.2 Processing Necessary For The Performance Of The Contract</strong><br>
You can choose whether or not you want to use the Services. However, if you want to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between The Companies and the users of the Services. We cannot provide many of the Services without your agreement to this contract, and without moving your personal data to The Companies entities and Service Providers in various jurisdictions. Therefore certain processing of your personal data is done on the legal basis of processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you, as a user of the Services, and The Companies.</p>
<p><strong>7.3 Safely Using The Companies’ Services</strong><br>

To make such a request, please write to us at the address below or at privacy@jpcycles.com with “Request for California Privacy Information” on the subject line and in the body of your message. We will comply with your request within thirty (30) days or as otherwise required by the statute. Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.</p>
<p><strong>8. Changes to Our Privacy Notice</strong><br>
