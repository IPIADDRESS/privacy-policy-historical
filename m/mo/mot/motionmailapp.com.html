    <section class="mm-block mm-block--light mm-block--auth">
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            MotionMailApp.com is a website where users can create dynamic animated gifs resulting in countdown timers that can be added to emails (the "Network"), &nbsp;owned and operated by Web Advanced Corporation
            (“MotionMailApp.com”), a California corporation. MotionMailApp.com takes the private nature of your
            personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat
            the information we collect when you visit and use the Network. Please read this
            notice very carefully before using the Network.
        </p>
        <h2>Network Visitors</h2>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            Like most website operators, MotionMailApp.com collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers
            typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
            referring site, and the date and time of each visitor or image request. Our purpose in
            collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
            the Network visitors use the Service. From time to time, MotionMailApp.com may
            release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
            publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Network.
        </p>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            MotionMailApp.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information
            like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses as part of providing the core services. MotionMailApp.com reserves the right to
            use this personally-identifying information as part of using the service, or
            disclose this information in a aggregated form that does not include specific records.
            Other personally-identifying information is treated as described below.
        </p>
        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            Certain visitors to the Network choose to interact with the Network in
            ways that require MotionMailApp.com to gather personally-identifying information. The
            amount and type of information that We gather depends on the nature of the
            interaction. For example, We ask visitors who sign up for MotionMailApp.com to
            provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with
            MotionMailApp.com – by purchasing access that service, for example – are
            asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and
            financial information required to process those transactions. In each case,
            MotionMailApp.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
            appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the
            Service. MotionMailApp.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other
            than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
            personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them
            from engaging in certain Network-related activities.
        </p>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            MotionMailApp.com does not collect personally identifiable information from
            children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has provided
            MotionMailApp.com with personally identifiable information without the consent of his
            or her parent or guardian, please contact us at
            <a href="mailto:team@motionmailapp.com">team@motionmailapp.com</a>. If MotionMailApp.com
            becomes aware that a child under age 13 has provided Us with personally
            identifiable information, we will delete such information.
        </p>
        <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            MotionMailApp.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the
            Network. For instance, We may monitor the most popular content on the Network to
            help identify spam. We may display this information publicly or provide it to
            others. However, MotionMailApp.com does not disclose personally-identifying
            information other than as described below.
        </p>
        <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            MotionMailApp.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
            and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
            process it on Our behalf or to provide services available at the Network, and
            (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home
            country; by using the Network, you consent to the transfer of such information
            to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In
            these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business
            assets that is transferred. Moreover, if MotionMailApp.com or substantially all of
            its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that MotionMailApp.com goes out of
            business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that
            is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers
            may occur, and that any acquirer of MotionMailApp.com may continue to use your
            personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy.
            Otherwise, MotionMailApp.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying
            and personally-identifying information to anyone.
        </p>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or
            as described above, MotionMailApp.com discloses potentially personally-identifying
            and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or
            when We believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect
            the property or rights of MotionMailApp.com, third parties or the public at large. If
            you are a registered user of the Network and have supplied your email address,
            MotionMailApp.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
            solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with our
            Service. If you send us a request
            (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we
            reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your
            request or to help us support other users. MotionMailApp.com takes all measures
            reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration
            or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information.
        </p>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            You should also be aware that if you submit information to the Network,
            such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy
            rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may
            also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications.
        </p>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            For users outside the United States, please note that any
            personally-identifiable information you enter into the Network will be
            transferred out of your country and into the United States. You consent to such
            transfer through your use of the Network. You also warrant that you have the
            right to transfer such information outside your country and into the United
            States.
        </p>
        <h2>Links to Third Party Sites</h2>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected by MotionMailApp.com.
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that
            MotionMailApp.com does not own or control, or employees that MotionMailApp.com does not
            manage. The Network contains links to third party websites or may display images
            served from the Network that a third party has placed on a third party website. Any information you
            provide to, or that is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the
            privacy policies of those sites, if any. We encourage you to read such privacy
            policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is the sole responsibility of
            such third parties to adhere to any applicable restrictions on the disclosure of
            your personally-identifying information, and MotionMailApp.com and its affiliates
            shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your
            personally-identifying information by any third party.
        </p>
        <h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products,
            services or information that you did not expressly request, we will provide you
            with an e-mail address by which you may request no further notices.
        </p>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
            computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the
            visitor returns. MotionMailApp.com uses cookies to help Us identify and track
            visitors, their usage of the Network, and their Network access preferences.
            MotionMailApp.com visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers
            should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Network, with the
            drawback that certain features of the Network may not function properly without
            the aid of cookies.
        </p>
        <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            Although most changes are likely to be minor, MotionMailApp.com may change its
            Privacy Policy from time to time, and in MotionMailApp.com's sole discretion. If we
            do then we’ll notify you by posting the amended policy on the Network or by
            emailing you of the nature of the modifications along with a link to the
            modified document so that you can review it. In all cases, use of information we
            collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
            information is collected.
        </p>
        <h2>Review and Access</h2>
        <p class="mm-block__paragraph text-left">
            Upon your request, we will provide you with a summary of the information
            we collect about you. You will have the opportunity to correct, update, modify
            or delete this information by sending an e-mail to
