<b>About Motovy.com</b>
</p><p>
Thank you for visiting Motovy.com (the "Site"). We hope you find the information we provide to be useful to you.  We created this site to connect consumers like you with automotive dealers and others who are able to respond to requests you make on our site seeking information about automobiles and other related services (henceforth referred to as “Vendors” in this policy).  Your privacy is very important to us.  We wrote this statement to explain Motovy’s online information practices. This privacy policy covers this website, www.Motovy.com, and it applies to all information about you that is collected through the Site.   To enable the functionality explained above, we enable you to provide us with information about yourself that we then pass on to those Vendors. We may use information we learn about you to present you with other offers, improve the Site, and other uses we describe in this statement. We believe that it is important to clearly state how we use the information about you that we collect through this site.  We encourage you to read this privacy statement carefully so you are informed about how we use that information.  By using the Site, you agree to our use of your information consistent with this statement.

The Vendor will use the information from your Request, including your personal information, to contact you in connection with your Request.  <b>IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, THE VENDORS YOU SELECT MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY VIA FAX, EMAIL, AND TELEPHONE.  YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST ON THIS SITE, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.</b>  Vendors or others to whom we provide your information may also use the information in your Request to market other products or services to you or in other ways in accordance with their own privacy guidelines.

  </li><li>
