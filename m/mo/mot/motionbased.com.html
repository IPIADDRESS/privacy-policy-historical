	<ul>
	<li>MotionBased has your consent; </li>
	<li>MotionBased determines that it is required to do so by law; such as in response to a court order or subpoena. </li>
	<li>MotionBased finds that you are in breach of its terms and conditions or any of its policies or usage guidelines for specific products or services; </li>
	<li>it is necessary in MotionBased’s opinion to do so to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences or attacks on the technical integrity of MotionBased’s site(s) or its network; </li>

	<p><b>What does MotionBased do to protect the data I transmit to MotionBased?</b><br>
MotionBased’s website uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information such as your name and address, as well as critically sensitive information such as your credit card number. MotionBased engages a company that is an industry leader in online security and site verification to ensure the security of MotionBased’s site. MotionBased’s website is also registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can confirm MotionBased’s identity before any personal information is sent. In addition, MotionBased’s secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall technology.</p>

	<p><b>What does MotionBased do after it gets an order from me?</b><br>
	Not only does MotionBased protect your purchase-related information as it is transmitted to MotionBased’s servers, but MotionBased also secures the servers themselves to help prevent unauthorized access to the data after it is in MotionBased’s hands. MotionBased has comprehensive security measures in place to protect its Internet servers, as well as its internal corporate computer resources, from loss, misuse, and alteration. In addition, your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to MotionBased’s ordering system.</p>

	<p><b>What can I do to help make sure the security works correctly?</b><br>
To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorized access to your private information, you should be aware of the security features available to you through your browser. You should use a security-enabled browser to submit your credit card information and other personal information at <a href="http://www.motionbased.com">www.motionbased.com</a>. Please note: If you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data intercepted. MotionBased will not be responsible for any compromise of data that is intercepted due to your use of an unsecured browser.</p>

	<p>Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between secure and insecure communications, receive invalid site identification information for the site you are communicating with, or send information over an unsecured connection. MotionBased recommends that you enable these browser functions to help ensure that your communications are secure. You can also monitor the URL of the site you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than the normal http://), along with the security symbol of your browser (an open or closed padlock in Netscape or a broken or complete key in Internet Explorer) to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. You can also view the details of the security certificate of the site to which you are connected. MotionBased encourages you to use this to check the validity of any site you connect to using secure communications.</p>
