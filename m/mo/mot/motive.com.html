                                    <p><strong>Our Commitment to Privacy and Protection of Your Personal Data</strong></p>
                                      <p>Compagnie Financi√®re  Alcatel-Lucent (CFAL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcatel-Lucent, and all Alcatel-Lucent  legal entities (collectively ‚ÄúAlcatel-Lucent‚Äù) recognize that our employees,  and the individuals who represent companies with whom we conduct business,  value their privacy. However, in order to conduct a global business in this  increasingly electronic economy, the collection of the personal data of  individuals is often necessary. We respect your right to privacy and are  committed to protecting your personal data. It is our goal to balance the  benefits of e-commerce with your right, as an individual, to prevent the misuse  of your personal data.</p>
  <p><strong>What Is Personal Data</strong></p>
                                      Personal data means any information that, when used alone or  combined with other data, may be <p>used to identify an individual. This includes,  but is not limited to, an individual‚Äôs first and last name, e-mail address,  mailing and/or residential addresses, telephone number, title, birth date,  gender, occupation, customer contact information and/or other personal  information that may be required in order for us to provide a service you  request, or may have requested, at our web sites.</p>
  <p><strong>Compliance With Laws</strong></p>
                                       <p>Alcatel-Lucent strives  to comply with all applicable and known laws around the world that are designed  to protect your right to privacy and prevent misuse of your personal data. Although  legal requirements may vary from country to country, we intend to adhere to the  principles set forth in this Global Privacy and Data Protection Web Site Policy  Statement even if we transfer your personal data from your country of residence  to countries that may not provide the same privacy rights or require the same  level of protection for your personal data. Our commitment is to protect your personal  data no matter where it is collected, transported, processed or retained.</p>
  <p><strong>US Subsidiary - Safe   Harbor Privacy Statement</strong></p>
                                      <p>For personal data of individuals  that the Alcatel-Lucent US subsidiary, Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc., receives from countries  covered by the European Directive 95/46/EC, Alcatel-Lucent is committed to  handling such personal data in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles. You  can find the Safe   Harbor certification of Alcatel-Lucent  USA Inc. at: <a href="http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list"><strong>http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list</strong></a>.  For more information about the Safe Harbor Principles, please visit the U.S.  Department of Commerce's web site at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/SH_overview.asp">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/SH_overview.asp</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Web Sites Covered by Our Privacy Statement </strong></p>
                                      <p>This Alcatel-Lucent Global  Privacy and Data Protection Web Site Policy Statement applies to all web sites  and domains of Alcatel-Lucent (<a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/">www.alcatel-lucent.com</a>).  Alcatel-Lucent web sites may provide links to unaffiliated third-party web sites  for your convenience and information; however, Alcatel-Lucent does not control  those unaffiliated third-party web sites or (except where Alcatel-Lucent is  providing your personal data to a third party with whom Alcatel-Lucent has  contracted for services) their privacy policies or practices as they relate to  the use and protection of your personal data. You may visit those third-party  links at your sole discretion and should read their privacy policies and  statements before providing them your personal data.</p>
  <p><strong>Collecting Your Personal Data </strong></p>
                                      <p>You will be able to  browse our web sites anonymously unless you have previously indicated that you  wish Alcatel-Lucent to remember your login identification and/or password. In  some circumstances, we may request you to provide personal data. Your response  to such a request is strictly voluntary. Alcatel-Lucent uses this personal data  to customize your experience on our web sites. We also may use your personal  data for other business purposes, such as alerting you to products and services  that can assist you in your business, promoting site registration, order  processing and online customer service.</p>
                                      <p>When you visit certain  Alcatel-Lucent web pages, you may need to be registered and create a password  in order to log in. The use of those web pages, and the downloadable information  on such web pages, may be governed by a written agreement between you, or your  employer, and Alcatel-Lucent. Unless you request your personal data to be  deleted, it may be retained by Alcatel Lucent, pursuant to applicable laws, to:  (i) verify compliance with the agreement, (ii) track software and documents you  download; or (iii) track page visits and usage of other applications available  on the Alcatel-Lucent web sites.</p>
                                      <p>We also may receive  your personal data from our business partners and suppliers. We intend to use  such personal data only if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable  privacy practices consistent with the Alcatel-Lucent Global Privacy and Data Protection  Policies as well as applicable laws.</p>
                                      <p>In general, you can  visit our web sites without divulging any personal data. However, there are  areas of our web sites that require us to collect personal data to complete the  customization functions for which they are designed that may not be available  to those individuals who elect not to provide the personal data requested. You  are always welcome to visit the public portion of the Alcatel-Lucent web sites  without revealing any personal data.</p>
  <p><strong>Use of Your Personal Data </strong></p>
                                      <p>When we collect your  personal data from you, we will inform you at the time as to the reason we are  requesting such personal data. The personal data will be used only for  Alcatel-Lucent business purposes such as: (i) responding to your requests for  products, documentation and/or services; (ii) processing your order or invoice;  (iii) conducting a commercial transaction; (iv) corresponding with you and/or  your company; (v) enabling your subscription or event registration; (vi)  handling a job application; (vii) sending direct marketing information; and/or  (viii) performing market research. We will also use your personal data to  personalize the content you review and to better understand how you use the web  sites in order to improve the services Alcatel-Lucent provides as well as the web  site information.</p>
                                      <p>Upon your acceptance of  the Terms of Use, which this Alcatel-Lucent Global Privacy and Data Protection Web  Site Policy Statement is a part, such an acceptance will include your  permission to us to collect and use your personal data. However, you have the  right to request Alcatel-Lucent not to contact you for the purposes of sending  you newsletters, customer surveys, direct marketing materials and/or market  research information. You can exercise this right by clicking on the  appropriate option or checkbox at the point where the personal data is  collected or by editing your personal data we have collected.</p>
                                      <p>In specific cases, Alcatel-Lucent  may request your direct consent to use your personal data by providing an  ‚Äúopt-in‚Äù and/or ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù checkbox in information fields before your personal  data can be used for any additional purposes to that for which your consent has  been or is given.</p>
  <p><strong>Disclosure of Your Personal Data to Third Parties</strong></p>
                                      <p>If you elect to provide  us with personal data, we may transfer that personal data within the Alcatel-Lucent  entities or to Alcatel-Lucent affiliated third parties or business partners. Your  personal data may be transferred within your country and/or across borders from  your country of residence or jurisdiction to Alcatel-Lucent entities,  affiliated third parties and/or business partners in other countries around the  world so that such Alcatel-Lucent entities, affiliated third parties and/or  business partners may provide services and other operations required to  transact business with you. Such personal data may include, but is not limited  to, account information, credit card information and ordering/invoicing  information.</p>
                                      <p>In addition, Alcatel-Lucent  may share your personal data (with the exception of account, credit card, and  ordering information) with other Alcatel-Lucent business partners who may  desire to alert you to new products and services to improve your competitive  edge, and only in cases where we believe your business interests will be  served. Alcatel-Lucent will share your personal data with its business partners  only if you have provided us with your consent to do so.
