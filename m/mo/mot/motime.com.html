It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information and to keep the Personal Information you provide us up to date. We reserve the right to revoke and/or terminate your right to use all or any portion of our Service and/or reject and delete any entry you make, if we have reason to believe information you provide to us is or may be false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or in violation of the <a href="http://www.motime.com/help/terms/">Terms of Use</a>. We are not liable in any way or responsible for damage that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or you fail to update the information you give us. Unless we obtain your consent, we will not use your Personal Information for any purpose other than as listed above. <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong> If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options from companies conducting business in California. If you are a California resident and wish to request information from us about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you must send us a request for information indicating your preference as to how you would like us to respond to your request (i.e., e-mail or postal mail). To request such information, either contact us via electronic form at <a href="http://www.motime.com/help/contactus/">http://www.motime.com/help/contactus/</a> or you may contact us via postal mail at:<br>&nbsp;<br>Motime - Privacy Administrator <br>P.O Box 297<br>New York, NY 10018-9998<br>Attn: Your California Privacy Rights<br>&nbsp;<br>All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled “Your California Privacy Rights” on the envelope or post card and that must also be clearly stated on the actual request. For all requests, please include your first and last name, street address, city, state and zip code. (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via e-mail, but please include your zip code for our record-keeping.) We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, notices that are illegible or that do not have complete information.<br>&nbsp; <br><strong>Promotions and Advertising.</strong> We may make advertisements, promotions and offers from other third parties available on or in connection with our Service. You acknowledge and agree that if you respond, take advantage of, accept or register for any offer, engage in any transactions or activities, enter or provide information or you redirect your browser, not only are you deemed to have opted into sharing that information (including Personal Information) with those third parties, you are also acknowledging and agreeing that their privacy policies and terms and conditions (not ours) apply to your relationship with them. We have no control over and no liability or responsibility for these third parties.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Opt Out Procedures.</strong> We may post notices, offers, advertising and promotional material on our Service and your agree that we may use your Personal Information to contact you by e-mail or text message or otherwise to promote our Service or to send you offers we believe may be of interest. You may chose to opt out of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails, text or other electronic messages from us by either: (i) sending an SMS to our short code, <strong>32000 </strong>(or other number we designate on our Website), (ii) calling our customer service representatives at <strong>1-888-243-2308</strong> or (iii) sending us an e-mail to <a href="mailto:help.us@motime.com"><strong>help.us@motime.com</strong></a>. If you are using SMS, you must unsubscribe separately to each active text alert or other Service you are enrolled in by using our Service keywords (you can find these on our Website) which must be a combination of ONLY (i) the Service name keyword and (ii) the word “OFF.” You agree that we may always contact you via e-mail or SMS for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding the administration of your subscription, any promotions you have entered or participated in, offers you have accepted or Service you have enrolled in or ordered or any of your transactions related to our Service.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Cookies and Technology.</strong> We use computerized tracking technology (we will refer to these generally as “cookies”), often from third parties, to collect data regarding your visits and use of our Service. This data is stored in aggregate form and is not used to identify a particular user or individual. We use cookies in a variety of ways: (a) to save your User ID, wireless device number and other information so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you use our Service; (b) to keep count of return visits to our Service and to advertisers’ or partners’ websites; (c) to accumulate and report aggregate statistical information in connection with our Service; and (d) to help us determine which Service you like best. Although we use aggregate tracking data to help us operate, manage, enhance, and improve our Service and display advertising and marketing information, Personal Information is not extracted in this process. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent and you can choose to turn off all cookie mechanisms through settings in your browser, however, if you turn cookies off you may not have access to many features and functions of our Service that make your experience more efficient and enjoyable and some of our Service may not work properly or at all. When you use our Service, you understand you will be involved in communication that goes through computer networks and communication facilities, portions of which are or may in the future be located in a number of jurisdictions around the world. You also understand that use of our Service, as well as the nature of digital communication and services, may result in transmission of interprovincial and international communications no matter where you, any device, item of computer equipment, communications or network resources may be physically located. No communication over the Internet or wireless communication can be perfectly secure – there is always a risk.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information.</strong> You agree that we may share your Personal Information with any of our parent, subsidiaries and affiliated companies, as well as with our operational service providers that assist in providing our Service. We will not share Personal Information we obtain in connection with our Service with any non-affiliated parties unless you opt in or consent (which you may be doing when you sign up, enroll or participate in any promotion, activity, co-branded Service, joint promotion, feature or function) and you always have the right to opt out at any time. If you do opt in or consent you will be deemed to have given your consent to us and the third party involved to collect, maintain, process, store and use your Personal Information for the purposes described in the opt in or consent. For Personal Information provided directly to third parties through the Service, if you wish to opt out of that third party’s use of your Personal Information, you will need to contact them directly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Some aggregate, non-personally identifiable data we collect in connection with our Service may be shared with our advertisers and other business partners, but we do not give any Personal Information to them unless permitted by this Privacy Policy or unless you have otherwise provided your consent. <br>&nbsp;<br>You agree that we may make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties for security, legal or other purposes necessary to protect our interests or the interests of others, including times when:<br>We are compelled by a governmental agency, court or other judicial or regulatory authority;<br>We believe your actions violate a law or regulation, a term or condition of the Terms of Use, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of us, any Motime Entity, any customers, users, or any other party;<br>We believe, in our sole judgment and discretion, that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests or to comply with any legal and regulatory obligations; or<br>We are involved in a merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination or in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.<br><strong><br>Security of Personal Information.</strong> We maintain commercially reasonable standards of security and confidentiality, however, for most websites, wireless and mobile communications, it is possible third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our Service in the same way. We also limit access to our Service by our own employees to individuals who are authorized and trained for the proper handling of such information. Any employee found violating our policies and standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request our operational service providers follow the same policy. If an actual or suspected breach of information security that is subject to any United States law that applies to you or your Personal Information, we will notify you (and any required law enforcement and regulatory authorities) as and when required by law.<br>&nbsp; <br><strong>Accessing and Changing Your Personal Information.</strong> Generally, you may review, correct, update and/or delete Personal Information collected by or through our Service, as well as user information you may have entered during the subscription process or your participation in our Service. Certain Personal Information is subject to corporate, audit and regulatory record-keeping requirements and will not be deleted unless the user is under 13 years of age (see "Deleting Personal Information of a Child," below). <br>&nbsp;<br>We will not allow direct access to any Personal Information by any person without the Registered User’s or Subscriber’s User ID or appropriate identification. Personal Information necessary to check eligibility, such as your date of birth or age or your wireless device numbers, may only be modified with sufficient verification.

<p id="terms">© <a href="http://www.dada-ent.com" target="_new">Dada Entertainment, LLC</a>. <b>Need help? <a href="http://www.motime.com/help/contactus/">Click here to contact us</a>.</b><br> Motime is certified to work with AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, T-Mobile, Alltel, and Virgin Mobile. This is a subscription service of $9.99/month. Message and Data Rates May Apply. You must be the account holder or have permission from the account holder to sign up for this service and incur the associated charges. Users will receive 15 credits each month. Upon signing up, they will also receive a one-time bonus of 10 additional credits. The credits can be used for mobile downloads (Ringtones = 1 credit, Wallpapers = 1 credit, Games = 3 credits). Games and apps are not available for Verizon Wireless, Alltel or Virgin Mobile users. Additionally, users will receive 120 text alert credits which can be used to activate text alerts. Charges will be billed to your cell phone bill or deducted from your prepaid account balance. Sample billing descriptors include AT&amp;T: "Motime.com Mobile Downloads," Sprint: "Motime.com Ringers - help.us@motime.com," T-Mobile: "32000 Motime 888-243-2308," Verizon Wireless: "Premium Messaging." Mobile content is not compatible with all cell phone models. We will send each customer a unique PIN. When a user enters that PIN during the sign-up process (on the Motime website), they are agreeing to becoming a subscriber (see our Subscription Agreement). Note, your account will automatically be charged each month and your account will be credited with download credits, unless you cancel by texting STOP to 32000, or by calling Customer Service at 888-243-2308. To sign up, you must be a U.S. resident and own a mobile phone (or have consent from the owner) and, if you are not yet an adult (in most, but not all places, 18), you must have parental permission to access the Service. <b>For help, text HELP to 32000.</b> For customer support, visit http://www.motime.com, call 888-243-2308 or send an e-mail to help.us@motime.com. Motime allows users to block their phone number or a family member's phone number from receiving our mobile services by texting BLOCK to 32000. To deactivate the block, call Customer Service at 888-243-2308.</p>
