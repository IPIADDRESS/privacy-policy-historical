If any provision of these Terms of Use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, t he invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term of any other term, and MI’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. MI reserves the right to amend these Terms of Use at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Use for any changes. Your use of the MI services following any amendment of these Terms of Use will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms.

<p>	</p><h1>Cookies</h1><p></p>
<p>	Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies may record information a user accesses on one webpage to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user, or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related web pages. Cookies make it easier for a user to move from webpage to webpage and to complete transactions over the Internet. You may learn more about cookies at the following URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie</p>
<p>	We use session ID cookies which make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We also use persistent cookies which remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies may be used to store your login information and preferences.</p>
<p>	Most major web browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you may modify your computer’s preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to disable the ability of third parties to download a cookie to you.</p>
<p>	If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but you may have to re-enter your username and password more often and you may experience some other unexpected browsing inconveniences.</p>
<p>	Other companies do not have access to cookies set by MI.</p>
<p>	Your ability to access, edit and delete your Personal Information</p>
<p>	For privacy and security reasons, we do not provide online access for members to their personal information.</p>
<p>	You may request that we delete your Personal Information by “deleting your account” in your my Account page.</p>
<p>	Despite the foregoing and even though you have requested us to remove information, we will retain in our files certain data such as information used to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, comply with credit card merchant banking and association agreements, enhance security, reduce fraud, comply with Federal and State law, or to enforce any agreements, policies, and rules governing your use of our website. Removed information also may persist in backup copies and/or other users’ cashes.</p>
<p>	If you have any further questions about your Personal Information, please Contact Us.</p>
<p>	</p><h1>Confidentiality and security</h1><p></p>
<p>	We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>	We limit access to your personal information and e-mail address to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information.</p>
<p>	</p><h1>Minors</h1><p></p>
<p>	MI is an adult site and access to persons under the age of 18 is strictly prohibited. We have no intention of collecting any personal information from individuals under eighteen years of age. If a minor has provided us with personal information, a parent or guardian of that minor should Contact Support and we will remove this information from our existing files.</p>
<p>	Changes to this Privacy Policy or e-mail practices</p>
<p>	MI reserves its right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to revise, amend, modify or revoke this Privacy Policy at any time and in any manner to the fullest extent permitted by law. Changes to this Policy will be effective by posting revisions on the Privacy Policy link on the MI website.</p>
<p>	If we make changes in our e-mail practices or in the way we use your e-mail address, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
