<b>What information of yours does the Motivating Moments collect &amp; How is it Used?</b><br><br>

Information collected online is usually defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable. <br><br>




Anonymous information refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, Motivating Moments LLC collects some information each time a visitor comes to our website. Motivating Moments LLC collects the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from att.com or aol.com), referral data (e.g., the Internet address of the last Web page visited by a user before clicking over to our website site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Windows platform). Motivating Moments LLC collects this user information for purposes of website monitoring, improvement, and targeted advertising.

Personally identifiable information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and email address, which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described above.

<!--<b>Registration Form - For Subscription Membership</b><br><br>

On-line subscription membership is available for a yearly subscription. Members are asked to provide certain personal information including name, address, email address, billing information (such as a credit card, checking account or direct debit account number) during the registration process. We use a third party partner http://www.paypal.com PayPal to process all of our online billing. <br><br>

It is the Member's responsibility to insure that all information is up-to-date, always.  If you have changed your name or email address please contact us at helping@motivateus.com<br><br>
