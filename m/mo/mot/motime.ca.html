<br>

You agree that we may from time to time, transfer or merge your Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format. You also agree that we may combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from our advertisers and promotional partners.

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
Cookies and Technology. We use computerized tracking technology (we will refer to these generally as “cookies”), often from third parties, to collect data regarding your visits and use of our Service. This data is stored in aggregate form and is not used to identify a particular user or individual. We use cookies in a variety of ways: (a) to save your User ID, wireless device number and other information so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you use our Service; (b) to keep count of return visits to our Service and to advertisers’ or partners’ websites; (c) to accumulate and report aggregate statistical information in connection with our Service; and (d) to help us determine which Service you like best. Although we use aggregate tracking data to help us operate, manage, enhance, and improve our Service and display advertising and marketing information, Personal Information is not extracted in this process. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent and you can choose to turn off all cookie mechanisms through settings in your browser, however, if you turn cookies off you may not have access to many features and functions of our Service that make your experience more efficient and enjoyable and some of our Service may not work properly or at all. When you use our Service, you understand you will be involved in communication that goes through computer networks and communication facilities, portions of which are or may in the future be located in a number of jurisdictions around the world. You also understand that use of our Service, as well as the nature of digital communication and services, may result in transmission of interprovincial and international communications no matter where you, any device, item of computer equipment, communications or network resources may be physically located. No communication over the Internet or wireless communication can be perfectly secure – there is always a risk.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Disclosure of Personal Information.&nbsp;You agree that we may share your Personal Information with any of our parent, subsidiaries and affiliated companies, as well as with our operational service providers that assist in providing our Service. We will not share Personal Information we obtain in connection with our Service with any non-affiliated parties unless you opt in or consent (which you may be doing when you sign up, enroll or participate in any promotion, activity, co-branded Service, joint promotion, feature or function) and you always have the right to opt out at any time. If you do opt in or consent you will be deemed to have given your consent to us and the third party involved to collect, maintain, process, store and use your Personal Information for the purposes described in the opt in or consent.&nbsp; For Personal Information provided directly to third parties through the Service, if you wish to opt out of that third party’s use of your Personal Information, you will need to contact them directly.<br>
<br>
Some aggregate, non-personally identifiable data we collect in connection with our Service may be shared with our advertisers and other business partners, but we do not give any Personal Information to them unless permitted by this Privacy Policy or unless you have otherwise provided your consent.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
You agree that we may make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties for security, legal or other purposes necessary to protect our interests or the interests of others, including times when:<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we are compelled by a governmental agency, court or other judicial or regulatory authority;<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we believe your actions violate a law or regulation, a term or condition of the Terms of Use or &nbsp;if you threaten the rights, property or safety of us, any Motime Entity, any customers, users, or any other party;<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we believe, in our sole judgment and discretion, that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests or to comply with any legal and regulatory obligations; or<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we are involved in a merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination or in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.<br>
Security of Personal Information. We maintain commercially reasonable standards of security and confidentiality, however, for most websites, wireless and mobile communications, it is possible third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our Service in the same way. We also limit access to our Service by our own employees to individuals who are authorized and trained for the proper handling of such information. Any employee found violating our policies and standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request our operational service providers follow the same policy. If an actual or suspected breach of information security that is subject to any Canadian law that applies to you or your Personal Information, we will notify you (and any required law enforcement and regulatory authorities) as and when required by law.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Accessing and Changing Your Personal Information. Generally, you may access, review, correct, update and/or delete Personal Information collected by or through our Service, as well as user information you may have entered during registration, the subscription process or your participation in our Service. Certain Personal Information is subject to corporate, audit and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will be retained for such period(s) as permitted by law. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
We will not allow direct access to any Personal Information by any person without the Registered User’s or Subscriber’s User ID or appropriate identification.&nbsp; Personal Information necessary to check eligibility, such as your date of birth or age or your wireless device numbers, may only be modified with sufficient verification. If you delete or attempt to delete such information, it may result in the suspension of any and all rights you may have to use our Service.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We always reserve the right to deny, suspend, deactivate, terminate and cancel any registration, subscription, User ID and the use of or access to any or all of our Service, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to use our Service. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide you access to your Personal Information. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our Community Code<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Privacy is very important to us, but along with respect for your Personal Information we also respect your desire to have an enjoyable experience with our Service. That means we expect our user community to conduct themselves in a way that allows all our users to take advantage of our great Service in a positive environment. In that spirit, we developed guidelines – ‘rules of the road’ – that you must observe when using our Service.&nbsp;You are solely responsible for what you do or fail to do – that also means you shouldn’t encourage or try to have someone else do what you are not allowed to do. We will still hold you accountable and you will be responsible as if you had done these things yourself. Remember, you and others like you are guests in our Service and you must play by the rules or we can and will ask you to leave. <br>

Helpful Tips<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Don’t Assume Anything About Anyone or Anything<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Opinions, advice, statements, offers and information are solely those of the authors or originators and you should NOT rely on them as accurate. You may never know whether it is there for entertainment or any other reason or purpose. Always consult with your own professional or other advisors because we do not check, verify, endorse or accept responsibility for any of these things, nor do we represent or guarantee accuracy, completeness, usefulness or anything else. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
DON’T share anything you don’t want everyone to know or that might embarrass you.<br>
Our Service is a public space. Assume your Post will be seen by others who you may not know. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
DO be careful about joining communities of others or adding others to your community. <br>
People aren't always who they say they are. Things are not always what they seem. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
DON’T mislead people. <br>
Be truthful when you share. Deception makes people angry and has consequences – even here. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
DO report harassment, hate speech and other inappropriate things. <br>
If you feel someone's behavior is inappropriate or making you uncomfortable, report it right away. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
DON’T share your identity or Personal Information with anyone you don’t know.<br>
Things like your real name, phone numbers and addresses make it easy for someone to find you – even someone you don’t want to find you or someone you don’t want to communicate with. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
DO take your conduct seriously.<br>
We give you control over your online experience. That means you choose what to share or not and what to do or not. What you decide online has consequences and may give someone else some control, especially if you share information or choose to meet or communicate with someone. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
DON’T meet people you do not fully know and trust.<br>
If you do decide to meet, do it in a public place, bring a parent or friend and make sure a responsible adult knows exactly where you are and what you are doing ALL THE TIME – online or in person. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
DO try using a third-party, anonymous e-mail address.<br>
As an added safety measure, we recommend using a third-party, anonymous e-mail address expressly for communicating with other users instead of using your personal (and potentially personally identifiable) e-mail address or account. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
DON’T use a provocative, sexually explicit, shocking or otherwise inappropriate user name.<br>
Using sex, race, ethnic or other names and words may get you noticed, but also may attract the wrong kind of attention. Remember you can control your choices; you can’t control others. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
DO block abusers and report them to us.<br>
We STRONGLY encourage you to block anyone who is or you suspect is behaving in any way that you feel is making you or anyone you know uncomfortable. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
