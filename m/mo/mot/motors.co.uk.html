    <h2>PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>

	<p>This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Namesco Limited.</p>
 	<p>This web site agrees to notify you of:</p>

	<ul class="generic">
        <li>What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the website</li>
        <li>The organization collecting the information</li>
        <li>How the information is used</li>
        <li>With whom the information may be shared</li>
        <li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information</li>
        <li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Namesco Limited control</li>
        <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
	</ul>

 	<p>If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should <a href="/contact.html" rel="external">contact us</a></p>

	<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
	<p>Namesco Limited is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, 
    or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Namesco 
    Limited collects information from our users at several different points on our website.</p>

    <h3>Order</h3>
	<p>We request information from the user on our registration, order and payment forms. Here a user must provide 
    contact information (like name and address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This 
    information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, 
    this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.</p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie 
    is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site and is encrypted so cannot be read 
    by any other website. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. It will also terminate 
    once a period of time has elapsed since first using the site.</p>

    <h3>Log Files</h3>
	<p>We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate 
    use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h3>Sharing</h3>
	<p>We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any 
    personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>

	<p>We use a credit card processing company to bill users for services. These companies do not retain, share, 
    store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

    <h3>Links</h3>
	<p>This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we [Namesco Limited] are not responsible 
    for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site 
    and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This 
    privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
	<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information 
    via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p>

	<p>When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information 
    is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure 
    page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator 
    and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.</p>

	<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to 
    protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned 
    above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job 
    (for example, our accounting staff or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
    identifiable information.</p>

    <h3>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h3>
	<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your post code), or if a user no longer 
    desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal 
    data provided to us.</p>

    <h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
	<p>If you use this site to purchase services you may occasionally receive information on products, services, 
    special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to 
    not receive these types of communications on our order form.</p>

	<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out 
    of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email, or by 
    contacting us directly.</p>

	<p>Users of our site are notified when their information is being collected or used by any third 
    parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed 
    with services that require an third party, or not.</p>

    <h3>Notification of Changes </h3>
	<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users 
    are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, 
    we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from 
    that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as 
    to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance 
    with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
