		In designing our website, we started with the simple belief that customer service is our number one priority.  Therefore the customer information we collect is used to enhance our services to you, our customer.</p>
		Specific areas from which we collect data include:<p></p>
		<ul type="square">
			<li><b>Membership.</b> Prior to checking out, we ask our customers to become a Mothernature.com Member. To ensure easy shopping and timely product delivery we ask for shipping information including your email address and phone number so we can quickly communicate with you about the status of your order. Additionally, we ask for limited demographic information including your birth-date and gender, which enables us to continually update our site to better meet the needs of our members. Should you wish to change your membership information, simply click on <a href="/asp/membership.asp">Your Account</a> or call our customer service department at (800) 517-9020 or (978) 929-1300; Fax (877) 355-1144, Monday through Friday, 9am-9pm EST; closed Saturday &amp; Sunday.  Please also note that while we can make your account inactive and ensure that MotherNature.com in the future does not contact you, due to our quality control practices, we cannot delete member files. 
			</li><li><b>E-mail newsletters.</b> We give our members the option to sign up for our weekly newsletter. This service is meant to better assist you to make informed decisions about your health, as well as the health of your family and friends. To sign you up we simply need an e-mail address. Subscriptions can be canceled at any time. In addition, you may unsubscribe to any of the free personalized e-mail services you have chosen at any time, without any future correspondence or questions. Please send your comments and complaints to <a href="mailto:newsletter@mothernature.com">newsletter@mothernature.com</a>. If you do not wish to receive product and health information updates from us, simply send an email with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line of the message.
			</li><li><b>Purchases.</b> When you order from MotherNature.com, we ask for your name, address, and credit card - all of which are necessary for purchase and delivery.

</li><li><b>Create An Account.</b> Customers creating an account at MotherNature.com are asked to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. They are also asked for the year of their birth so that MotherNature.com can determine whether they are 13 years of age or older as described in our "<a href="#p6">Parental Consent</a>" section. Customers are asked to choose a password.
</li><li><b>Ask An Expert.</b> Customers submitting a question to one of our health experts are asked to include their name, email address, city, and age. MotherNature.com never prints the full name of questioners on the site.

		Our cookies, which are small pieces of information that are stored by the web browser on a computer's hard drive, help us facilitate customers' visits to MotherNature.com. Cookies tell us when a user is a repeat visitor to our site, and let us know how he or she found us. They also allow us to automatically link our customers to their personalized accounts, including shopping baskets and Personal Shopping Accounts. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies. Please check your browser's guidelines should you wish to reject cookies. A visitor who chooses to reject the cookie may still view our site's extensive content, such as our Encyclopedia, Health Journal, and Rodale books online; however, he or she will not be able to make a purchase, nor use the <b>My MotherNature</b> feature for members. Our cookies link to a member's identification number, which does not include any personally identifiable information.</p>
		<p><a name="p6"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica"><b>Parental Consent</b></font></a><br>
		Our privacy policy prohibits us from accepting members who are under the age of 13.  Children under the age of 13 are free to explore our site, but should they wish to become members or make a purchase we require that they do so through their parents' account.  Should you have additional questions or concerns, please contact our customer service department at <a href="mailto:customerservice@mothernature.com">CustomerService@MotherNature.com</a>.</p>
		<p><a name="p7"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica"><b>Log on Files</b></font></a>
		<br>MotherNature.com automatically logs IP addresses and session sources (e.g., if the user came from an affiliate's site). We do not log the ISP or the browser type. The information is not logged to personally identifying information, nor to the member's identification number. MotherNature.com uses these logs for sales and marketing tracking as well as system performance monitoring. These logs are reviewed for the overall, aggregate trends they reveal about our customers, not for the behaviors of individual users.
</p><p><a name="p8"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica"><b>Sharing of Information</b></font></a>
<br>MotherNature.com protects account information against unauthorized access or release. We will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party, unless the customer has authorized us to or we are legally required to do so. Additionally, we do not share the buying habits of individual consumers. We may share aggregate customer data with our Wellness Advisors and with selected manufacturers and advertising partners. In some cases, MotherNature.com provides the email addresses of our current customers to direct email companies working on our behalf. In this way, these companies can appropriately direct our promotional mailings to the correct customers (e.g., to prevent duplicate promotions). Promotional emails only go out to customers who have indicated they wish to receive them and customers may elect at any time not to receive any further emails.
</p><p><a name="p9"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica"><b>Third Party Intermediaries</b></font></a>
<br>To complete credit card transactions, MotherNature.com provides the following member information—using secure communications—to CyberSource, the intermediary credit card processing company we use: name, billing address, credit card number, expiration date, and the amount of the transaction. MotherNature.com shares shipping information with intermediary shipping companies including but not limited to UPS, USPS, Airborne Express, and DHL. 
</p><p><a name="p10"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica"><b>Notification of Changes</b></font></a>
<br>In the event that MotherNature.com should change its privacy practices or start using member information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we would send email to our members notifying them of the changes, explaining the reasons and allowing them the opportunity to accept the changed policy, or demand exemption from it.
