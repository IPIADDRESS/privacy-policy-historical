			<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we 
			collect, how we collect it, how we use it, how we disclose it, how we protect it, and what 
			choices you have with respect to all of the above. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy 
			so that you will understand both our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can 
			participate in that commitment.</p>

			<p>This Privacy Policy governs the information collection and disclosure practices for the 
			web sites and mobile data services operated by Motricity, Inc. and all of its wholly-owned 
			subsidiaries, including but not necessarily limited to Motricity, Inc., Power By Hand, LLC, 
			Pinpoint Network, Inc., and Pinpoint Technology, Inc. (collectively, the "Company", or "we" 
			or "us"). The Company's web sites include, but are not necessarily limited to, all of the 
			following web sites, each of which is operated (either directly or through one or more 
			wholly-owned subsidiaries) by the Company: www.motricity.com, www.powerbyhand.com, 
			www.gin.com, www.gin.nl, www.moviso.com, www.mcore.com, and www.yourmobile.com (each a 
			"Web Site" and collectively the "Web Sites").</p>

			<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>

			<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it 
			regularly. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy 
			Policy on the Web Sites and other places we deem appropriate. All such changes shall 
			be binding on you 30 days after they are initially posted on the Web Sites unless you 
			are a new user, in which case they are binding on you immediately.</p>

			<h3>Information Collection</h3>

			<h5>General.</h5>
			<p>In general, you can browse the Web Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any 
			personal information about yourself. However, if you wish to purchase or download any of the 
			products or use any of the services offered by the Web Sites, you may be required to disclose 
			certain information to us. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing 
			not to purchase or download a particular product or use a particular service or feature. The 
			Company is the sole owner of the information collected on the Web Site.</p>

			<h5>Registration.</h5>
			<p>In order to purchase or download products or use the services offered by this Web Site, 
			you must first create an account with us. You may have to establish a separate account if 
			you use the services or purchase or download products from more than one Web Site. During 
			the account set-up process, you are required to give certain contact information, including 
			your name, email address, and in some cases your approximate age. We use this information 
			to contact you about the products services on our site in which you have expressed interest, 
			and, the case of your approximate age, to determine whether you old enough to use the Web 
			Sites. You may have the option to provide additional demographic information (such as 
			income level, location, and gender) to us; we encourage you to submit this information 
			so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. Where possible, we 
			indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.</p>

			<h5>Orders.</h5>
			<p>If you purchase or download a product or service from us, we request certain 
			personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide 
			contact information (such as name, email, and address) and, where applicable, 
			financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this 
			information for billing purposes and to fulfill your orders. If we have trouble 
			processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>

			<h5>Surveys or Contests.</h5>
			<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests 
			or surveys on the Web Sites. If you participate, we will request certain personally 
			identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is 
			completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose 
			this information. The requested information typically includes contact information 
			(such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 
			We use this information to notify contest winners and to award prizes. We may use 
			a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests.</p>

			<h5>Log Files.</h5> 
			<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and 
			store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, 
			browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, 
			date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify 
			individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements 
			around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 
			We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

			<h5>Cookies.</h5>
			<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping 
			purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies 
			to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site, unless you have 
			elected to have the Web Site "remember" you, in which case the cookie will be linked to 
			your user name. We may use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use 
			session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie 
			expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for 
			an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions 
			provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. We set a persistent cookie to store 
			your password, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also 
			enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on 
			our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use 
			some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. This Privacy 
			Policy covers the use of cookies by this Web Site only and does not cover the use 
			of cookies by any advertisers or third parties. See the sections on "Third Party 
			Advertisers" and "Co-Branded Pages" below. We may also use a third-party tracking 
			service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about 
			visitors to our site in the aggregate. We do not control the use of cookies by 
			third parties.</p>

			<h5>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs).</h5>
			<p>We may employ or our third party advertising partner may employ a software 
			technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs) that help us better 
			manage content on or about the Web Sites by informing us what content is effective. 
			Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to 
			cookies, that are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast 
			to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are 
			embedded invisibly on web pages or in HTML-based emails and are about the 
			size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information 
			gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 
			We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have 
			been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain 
			communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>

			<h5>Correspondence.</h5>
			<p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if 
			other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or 
			postings on the Web Sites, we may collect such information into a file specific 
			to you.</p>

			<h5>Third Party Advertisers.</h5>
			<p>Ads appearing on this Web Site may be delivered to users by a third party 
			advertising partner. We may share Web Site usage information about users with 
			our advertising partners for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner 
			advertisements on this site. Such information will not be linked to 
			personally-identifiable information. Our advertising partners may use 
			cookies and/or clear GIFs, which allow them to recognize a user when a 
			user visits this Web Site.</p>

			<h5>Co-Branded Pages.</h5>
			
			<p>In some cases, third party web sites may have a "look and feel" similar 
			to one of the Web Sites, and these third party web sites may even be 
			bordered ("framed") by content from the Web Sites, but any information 
			collected by such web sites is collected by the third party operator of 
			that site. These sites are usually identified by a "Powered by" or similar 
			logo identifying the third party operator of the linked site. Information 
			collection on those sites is governed by the privacy policy posted on those 
			sites. In some cases, the third party operator may share the information 
			with us, in which case our use of that information will be governed by 
			this Privacy Policy.</p>

			<h5>Supplementation of Information.</h5>
			<p>In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement 
			the personal information you submitted to us with information from third 
			party sources.</p>

			<h5>Security.</h5>
			<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you 
			enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social 
			security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that 
			information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow 
			generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal 
			information submitted to us from unauthorized access, disclosure, 
			alteration, or destruction, both during transmission and once we 
			receive it.</p>

			<h3>Use of Information</h3>

			<h5>General.</h5>
			<p>We use your personal information to fulfill orders and to facilitate 
			the services you purchase or request from us. We use your personal 
			information in the file we maintain about you, and other information 
			we obtain from your current and past activities on the Web Sites to: 
			resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; collect fees owed; measure 
			consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online 
			and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your 
			experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal 
			activity; enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use; and as otherwise 
			described to you at the time of collection. We may compare and review 
			your personal information for errors, omissions and for accuracy.</p>

			<h3>Communications from Us.</h3>

			<h5>Special Offers and Updates.</h5>
			<p>We will occasionally send you information on special deals or promotions. 
			Out of respect for your privacy, you have the option not to receive these 
			types of communications. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section.</p>

			<h5>Newsletters.</h5> 
			<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletters, we will use your name and 
			email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your 
			privacy, you have the option to unsubscribe from receiving some or all 
			of the newsletters. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section.</p>

			<h5>Service-related Announcements.</h5>
			<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions 
			when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily 
			suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may 
			not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. 
			If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your 
			account.</p>

			<h5>Customer Service.</h5>
			<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, 
			we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. 
			We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide 
			the services you request, and to manage your account.</p>

			<h5>Profile.</h5>
			<p>We store information that we collect through your stated preferences, 
			cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources to create a 
			"profile" of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable 
			information, and your activity history, to information in the profile, 
			in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to 
			improve the content of the site for you. We do not share your profile 
			with other third parties, other than in aggregate, de-identified form.</p>

			<h5>Mobile User Information.</h5>
			<p>As part of our mobile products and services, we receive personal 
			information from wireless carriers and operators in order to provision 
			the specific content and data services requested by individual cell 
			phone users. All such personal information is acquired from either 
			the wireless carrier's website or from the user's cell phone via the 
			wireless carrier's network. This personal data is usually limited to 
			the user's name and cell phone number. In certain cases, such as for 
			gaming tournament prize fulfillment, the user's mailing address is 
			also provided. The user must explicitly "opt in" through the wireless 
			carrier in order for any of this information to be collected and its 
			use is governed by this Privacy Policy and any policies or procedures 
			of the user's wireless carrier. We only use personal information we 
			receive as part of our mobile products and services for the purpose 
			of providing those products and services to the wireless carriers and 
			operators and their subscribers.</p>

			<h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>

			<h5>General.</h5>
			<p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal 
			information to third parties for their marketing purposes without 
			first providing you with an opportunity to opt-out. However, the 
			following describes some of the ways that we may disclose your 
			personal information in the normal course of providing our services.</p>

			<h5>Suppliers &amp; Developers.</h5>
			<p>Where you purchase or download a product or service on one of our 
			Web Sites, we may disclose your name and email address to our partner 
			who is our supplier of that product or service. For example, if you 
			download a particular software application, we may disclose your name 
			and email address to the developer of that software application. This 
			disclosure is to enable the developer or supplier to provide support 
			to you, and in certain cases to allow you to benefit from certain levels 
			of support that are only available to registered users. We have no control 
			over what these third parties do with the information that we disclose to 
			them.</p>

			<h5>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable).</h5> 
			<p>We share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about our 
			user base with our partners and advertisers. This information does not 
			identify individual users.</p>

			<h5>Agents and Service Providers.</h5>
			<p>We may use third parties to provide, on our behalf, some portions 
			of the products and services available on the Web Sites. For instance, 
			we use a credit card processing company to bill you for services, and we 
			may use third party service providers to provide certain fulfillment 
			services for some of our products or services. We use our best efforts, 
			to the extent commercially reasonable, to ensure that these companies do 
			not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information that 
			we disclose to them for such purposes for any other purposes.</p>

			<h5>Your Use of the Web Site.</h5>
			<p>If you participate in a bulletin board or other public forum offered by 
			the Web Sites, your User ID will be displayed on any content that you post 
			and will therefore be available to the public. Therefore, if you associate 
			your name with your User ID, your name will be available to the public. Any 
			other information about yourself that you include in such posts will be 
			publicly available.</p>

			<h5>Legal Requests.</h5>
			<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information 
			as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect 
			our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal 
			process served on our Web Sites.</p>

			<h5>Disclaimer.</h5>
			<p>We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal 
			information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this 
			Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be 
			forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties 
			under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or 
			access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or 
			misuse your personal information that they collect from the Web Sites.</p>

			<h3>Choice / Opt-Out</h3>

			<p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally 
			identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this 
			information. For example, if you register with us but do not wish to receive 
			any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on 
			our registration form. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters and 
			promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following 
			the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing 
			us at privacy@motricity.com. You may also update your preferences at any 
			time by accessing our member information area. You will be notified before 
			your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our 
			agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether 
			or not to share your information with that party.</p>

			<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

			<p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by these 
			Web Sites. The Web Sites contain links to other sites that are not owned or 
			controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy 
			practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware of when you leave 
			our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that 
			collects personally identifiable information.</p>

			<h3>Access to Personal Information</h3>

			<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer 
			desire some or all of our services, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate 
			it by making the change on our account information pages or by emailing us at 
			privacy@motricity.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail 601 
			108th Avenue NE Suite 900 Bellevue, WA 98004 United States of America, 
			(425) 957-6201. Please note that, if you have established an account with 
			more than one of our Web Sites, you may have to make these changes on each 
			Web Site.</p>

			<h3>Business Transition</h3>

			<p>In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, 
			acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, 
			your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets 
			transferred.</p>

			<p>Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under 
			the Age of 13)</p>

			<p>In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, 
			Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), 
			which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which websites may 
			collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age 
			of 13. In accordance with InfoSpace policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:</p>

			<ol>
			<li>Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or 
				offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or</li>
			
			<li>Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age 
				with third parties.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given 
			to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon 
			as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from 
			our servers.</p>

			<p>Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to us at the contact 
			information provided below.</p>

			<h3>Safe Harbor</h3>

			<p>We abide by the European Union ("EU") Safe Harbor framework as set forth by 
			the Department of Commerce regarding collection, use, and retention of data from 
			the EU. Our privacy practices with respect to personal data collected from 
			individuals residing in the EU are self-certified to the Safe Harbor Program 
			developed by the US Department of Commerce and the European Commission. For 
			more information about the Safe Harbor Program, please go to 
			<a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/">http://export.gov/safeharbor/</a>. 
			Terms that are capitalized below have the same meanings given to them as part of 
			the Safe Harbor Program.</p>

			<h5>Mobile Services.</h5>
			<p>For mobile content and data services supplied through partner EU wireless 
			carriers and operators, we receive Personal Data transferred by users in the 
			EU to the US merely as a Data Processor on behalf of those partners. In this 
			capacity, we act as the Data Processor and our carrier partners act as the Data 
			Controllers. We do not own or control any of the Personal Data we process on behalf 
			of our carrier partners. Processes performed by us on behalf of our carrier partners 
			are pursuant to the instructions of the applicable partner. We may use the services 
			of third party Data Processors to process Personal Data in accordance with purposes 
			identified for such data by the applicable partner.</p>

			<h5>Web Sites.</h5>
			<p> EU users may browse Company web sites without providing or revealing any personal 
			information. If an EU user chooses to purchase or download content from us however, 
			we will request Personal Data from that user on our order form. In this capacity, we 
			act as the Data Controller for the user's Personal Data. In the case of purchased 
			content, we may use the services of third party Data Processors to process Personal 
			Data required for payment transactions.</p>

			<h5>Compliance with Applicable Law.</h5>
			<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose Personal Data to governmental 
			authorities when required or reasonably requested to do so by such governmental 
			authorities. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that it is in conflict 
			with any law that may be applicable to the Personal Data of a Data Subject.</p>

			<h5>Safe Harbor Verification.</h5>
			<p>Motricity verifies that this Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive, and 
			completely implemented, including implementation of appropriate employee training 
			and other internal procedures. Motricity further verifies that its privacy policy 
			conforms to the "Safe Harbor Principles" issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce 
			on July 21, 2000, which concerns compliance with European Union privacy protection 
			requirements by U.S. organizations.</p>

			<h3>Enforcement</h3>

			<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please direct 
			them to us at the contact information provided below. We have instituted internal 
			policies and procedures for handling such submissions and will respond to you in a 
			timely manner. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry, or if it is 
			not satisfactorily addressed, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission for 
			further action on your complaint at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy">www.ftc.gov/privacy</a>.</p>
