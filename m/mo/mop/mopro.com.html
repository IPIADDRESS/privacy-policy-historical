                                        improve your experience on our websites and assures that we can communicate with
                                        you about your account; it better equips us to develop services that cater to your
                                        particular needs; it helps us provide you with the most relevant products, services

                                        registration forms to Mopro, and non-Personal Information that we collect automatically

                                        Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual,
                                        including, but not limited to, your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail
                                        address, and credit card information such as the credit card number, card verification
                                        value, and the billing address. The types and amount of Personal Information collected

                                        Other information we gather includes aggregated tracking information derived mainly
                                        by tallying page views throughout our sites. This non-Personal Information also
                                        covers things like click-throughs, IP addresses, and usage data, and it may at times
                                        be combined with your Personal Information. All of this allows us to better tailor

                                        in developing services that help you achieve your business objectives, and we may

                                        use it to improve our customer support and client services, to troubleshoot other
                                        problems or resolve disputes, or for other business purposes. If you are referred

                                        secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized
                                        access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is
