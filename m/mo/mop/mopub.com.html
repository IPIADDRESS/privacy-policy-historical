<section>
<p><em> Last updated: July 19, 2017.</em></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>MoPub, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Twitter, Inc. that provides advertising technology services including its mobile advertising exchange, the MoPub website, and the MoPub SDKs and APIs (the âMoPub Servicesâ or âServicesâ). Our Services allow publishers of mobile applications (âappsâ) and websites to show ads on their sites and apps, and advertisers to reach audiences that may be interested in their products or services. This Privacy Policy explains how MoPub collects and uses information about visitors to MoPubâs websites, publisher and advertiser customers that use the MoPub Services (collectively, âMoPub Customersâ), and end users of apps and sites that use the MoPub Services.</p>
<p>Section 1 describes how MoPub collects and uses information from end users in providing the MoPub Services; Section 2 describes how MoPub collects and uses information about MoPub Customers and the information MoPub collects when an individual uses the MoPub website; and Section 3 contains information about our privacy practices that apply to both the information we collect from end users through the MoPub Services and the information we collect from MoPub Customers and users of our website.</p>
<h2 id="section1:enduserinformation">Section 1: End User Information</h2>
<p><strong> The Information We Collect </strong></p>
<p>When you interact with a website or app that uses the MoPub Services, we may collect information about your device and the ads you view or click. The MoPub Services are designed to avoid collecting information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, or email address, but the information we collect does enable us to recognize your device over time. The information we collect includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about your device, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS or Android), carrier name, IP address, mobile browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari), applications using the MoPub Services and the version of such applications, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID, or unique device identifier (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer).</li>
<li>Log information, including the app or website visited, session start/stop time, time zone, and network connection type (e.g., WiFi, cellular), and cookie information.</li>
<li>The geo-location of your device (using GPS or other geo-location data), when location services have been enabled for the mobile app or website that uses the MoPub Services.</li>
<li>Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and whether you visited the advertiserâs website or purchased the product or service advertised.</li>
<li>Information that MoPub Customers and other third parties have collected and share with MoPub, such as information about activity in their services. This may include the content you view or searches you made, the language you prefer, or other non-personally identifying demographic or interest information, to help make the ads served to you more relevant.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> How We Use the Information We Collect </strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect to provide and improve MoPub Services, including for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serving ads: Allowing publishers to offer advertising inventory in their mobile apps and websites, and advertisers to bid on and fill that inventory.</li>
<li>Ad Reporting and Conversions: Reporting to advertisers information about when and how users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their website, and reporting to publishers information about when and how ads were shown on their properties and were clicked on.</li>
<li>Frequency Capping: Preventing users from seeing the same ad too many times.</li>
<li>Fraud Detection and Prevention: Identifying invalid clicks (or ad queries) and protecting MoPub and MoPub Customers from fraudulent behavior.</li>
<li>Interest-Based Advertising: Allowing MoPub and MoPub Customers to infer interests and serve ads to users based on their app and website activity and inferred interests. MoPubâs policies prohibit MoPub Customers from sending or targeting advertisements based on information that we consider sensitive, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health.</li>
<li>Geo-Targeting: Where permitted by the userâs device, allowing MoPub and MoPub Customers to serve ads based on a userâs location.</li>
<li>Providing and Improving Our Services: Auditing, researching, and analyzing data in order to maintain, protect, and improve our Services and develop new services, and to ensure that our technologies function properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>MoPub will not combine the non-personally identifiable information collected to provide the MoPub Services with your personally-identifying information without your express consent.</p>
<p><strong> How We Share the Information We Collect </strong></p>
<p>We share the information we collect to provide and improve MoPub Services, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We share with advertiser customers information so that they can decide whether to bid on ad inventory or serve an advertisement and choose the best ad for that device. MoPub Customers are obligated to use the information they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
<li>We share aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about the use of our Services with MoPub Customers. For example, we provide advertisers reports showing how many users viewed or clicked on their ads. We also provide publishers reports about the types of ads served to their apps.</li>
<li>We share with partners who help with anti-fraud, quality, and security efforts to ensure the safety, security, privacy, and accuracy of the MoPub ecosystem.</li>
<li>We share with data partners who help MoPub Customers to improve the performance of their bids or inventory on our mobile advertising exchange.</li>
<li>We share information within our corporate family to provide, understand, or improve their or our services.</li>
</ul>
We also share information as described in Section 3 of this privacy policy.<br>
<p><strong> Choices </strong></p>
<p>Your iOS mobile device may provide a âLimit Ad Trackingâ setting. On Android devices, your settings may allow you to âOpt out of Interest-Based Ads.â When you have opted out using this setting on a device, MoPub will not use in-app information collected from that device to infer your interests or serve ads to that device that are targeted based on your inferred interests. Your mobile web browser may also provide a âDo Not Trackâ browser setting. When you have enabled this setting in your browser, MoPub will not use mobile web browsing information from that browser to infer your interests or serve ads to that device that are targeting based on your inferred interests. MoPub requires its advertising customers to honor opt-out preferences expressed using these controls.</p>
<p><strong> Privacy Practices of MoPub Customers </strong></p>
<p>MoPub requires MoPub Customers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide end users with notice of the collection of data for advertising purposes as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We encourage all users to review the privacy policies of sites and apps they visit for information about those sitesâ and appsâ data collection and use practices.</p>
<p><strong> Children </strong></p>
<p>MoPub does not permit the MoPub Service to be used to collect information from apps directed to children for purposes of creating interest-based profiles or serving ads based on usersâ inferred interests. MoPub may collect information from apps directed to children for other purposes, such as serving advertisements based on contextual information, like the the content or type of the application (for example, serving an ad for a video game to a gaming app).</p>

We may also share information within our corporate family to provide, understand, or improve their or our services, and as described in Section 3 of this privacy policy.</p>
<h2 id="section3:generalinformation">Section 3: General Information</h2>
<p><strong> Information Sharing and Disclosure </strong></p>
<p>We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us and our MoPub Customers in the United States and abroad. We may share the information we collect with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your information only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect the rights or property of MoPub, MoPub Customers, users of our website, or end users.</p>
<p>We may also share information when we have your consent to do so, or when a member of our corporate family has received your consent to do so.</p>
<p><strong> Information Provided by Third Parties </strong></p>
<p>We may receive information about you from third parties, including MoPub Customers, data partners, and our corporate family.

<p>In the event that MoPub is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>
<p><strong> Our Global Operations </strong></p>
<p>To bring you the Services, we operate globally. MoPub Inc. and its parent Twitter, Inc. comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield principles (the âPrinciplesâ) regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information from the European Union, as described in our <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list"> Privacy Shield certification </a> .</p>

<p>Privacy Shield participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies.
