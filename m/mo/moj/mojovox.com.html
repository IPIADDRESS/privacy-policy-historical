<h2>What information does Mojovox collect?</h2>
<blockquote></blockquote>

<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<br>
We only obtain and retain personally identifiable information that you give to us and certain related transactional information which we collect based on your use of our sites. For example, you might supply your email address by contacting us. You also may supply personally identifiable information, including your name, email address, and location by submitting questions or comments to our various public forums.
<br>
We may collect information concerning the transaction activities of users of our sites when they access different areas of our site. This transaction information includes information about the portions of our site such users visit and information about what data they access.
<blockquote></blockquote>

<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<br>
When you visit the public parts of our sites, we do not collect data about who you are or any other personally identifiable information except as described above. We do, however, collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you based upon your activity on our site. We may collect machine data such as processor type, processor speed, operating system type, browser type, audio devices, modem devices, and video cards. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.
<blockquote></blockquote>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<br>
Cookies are small data files that are sent from our servers to your computer during a browsing session. In order to make our site more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we may use cookies to assign your Internet browser a unique random number, a sort of anonymous user ID that is stored in a file on your computer. By using a cookie, we are able to automatically identify your browser and track your use of our site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but contain an option for you to turn off the acceptance of cookies if you prefer. You can also delete cookie files from your computer after they have been stored.

<h3>Children's Information</h3>
<br>
In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and fair information practices, MojoVox does not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from children.

          <li>We may provide all of the nonpublic personal information we collect about you to our affiliates to enable them or enhance our ability to offer you new or additional products or services, improve the quality of the products and services we currently offer to you, and to aid us and them in the assessment of our existing products and services and the development of new products or services.
          </li><li>Affiliates may include providers of systems support and services, and compliance services.

<h2>What levels of security does Mojovox have?</h2>
<br>
The public portions of our site are not encrypted or password-protected.
