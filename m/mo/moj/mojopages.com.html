  <div class="privacyPolicyTitle">OUR COMMITMENT: RESPECTING AND PROTECTING OUR CUSTOMERS´ PRIVACY</div>
       <p>Your privacy is important to us. MOJOPAGES.COM respects and takes steps to protect the privacy of our customers. We strive to take reasonable care of information we may receive from you.</p>
       <div class="privacyPolicyTitle">THE SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY </div>
       <p>This Privacy Policy addresses the privacy of visitors to the MOJOPAGES.COM Web sites. It identifies the type of data and information MOJOPAGES.COM collects from visitors, how we use and disclose it, and the steps we take to protect privacy.</p>
       <div class="privacyPolicyTitle">WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT &amp; HOW WE USE IT</div>

							<p><span style="font-size:13px;">Security</span><br>MOJOPAGES.COM takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to protect your information. No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any firewalls or secure server software we may employ. MOJOPAGES.COM continues to evaluate and implement enhancements in security technology and practices, however we can only take steps to help reduce the risks of unauthorized access. MOJOPAGES.COM has taken the following steps in this regard: </p>

							<ul>
							<li><b>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</b><br>MOJOPAGES.COM uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as registration information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time MOJOPAGES.COM asks you for a credit card number on MOJOPAGES.COM for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number on MOJOPAGES.COM, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of your number. </li>
							<li><b>Secure Storage</b><br>MOJOPAGES.COM maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. </li>
							<li><b>Vendors and Partners</b><br>MOJOPAGES.COM works with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user information. </li>
							<li><b>Employee and Contractor Access to Information</b><br>MOJOPAGES.COM limits access to personal information about you to those employees who we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. </li>

							<li><b>Education and Training for Employees</b><br>MOJOPAGES.COM has implemented a company-wide education and training program about security that is required of every MOJOPAGES.COM employee. </li>
							</ul>
							<p>If MOJOPAGES.COM learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this Web site or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this site. MOJOPAGES.COM may post a notice on our Web site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a Web browser enabling you to view the MOJOPAGES.COM Web site.
