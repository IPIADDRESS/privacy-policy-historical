Mouseflow is concerned with protecting your privacy and data, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Mouseflow or guarantee that your information on the Mouseflow Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical or managerial safeguards. When you enter sensitive information (such as log in credentials) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mouseflow.com">privacy@mouseflow.com</a> We use an outside help platform, and a credit card processing company to bill you if you purchase services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>

                            <p>Enforcement and Dispute Resolution. In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Mouseflow commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss Data Subjects with questions or concerns about the use of their Personal Data should contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@mouseflow.com">privacy@mouseflow.com</a>. If your question or concern cannot be satisfied through this process, Mouseflow has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks to BBB EU Privacy Shield, an independent dispute resolution mechanism operated in the United States by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Mouseflow, EU and Swiss Individuals and Data Subjects should go to <a href="http://bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/</a> for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the BBB EU Privacy Shield will be provided at no cost to you. Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU and Swiss Individuals and Data Subjects may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel — a binding arbitration mechanism.</p>
