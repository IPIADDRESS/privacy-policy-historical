In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Mouseflow commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss Data Subjects with questions or concerns about the use of their Personal Data should contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@mouseflow.com">privacy@mouseflow.com</a>. If your question or concern cannot be satisfied through this process, Mouseflow has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks to BBB EU Privacy Shield, an independent dispute resolution mechanism operated in the United States by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Mouseflow, EU and Swiss Individuals and Data Subjects should go to <a href="http://bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/</a> for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the BBB EU Privacy Shield will be provided at no cost to you. Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU and Swiss Individuals and Data Subjects may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel — a binding arbitration mechanism.</p></li><li><p>Our Retention Of Your Information.</p><p>(a) If you have an account with Mouseflow, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
