<h2>Mountain Goat Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Mountain
Goat Software, LLC ("MGS") website <u><a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/">www.mountaingoatsoftware.com</a></u>
and its related websites and microsites (collectively, the "Site") provided
to you by MGS, its affiliate and subsidiary companies ("MGS",
"us" or "we"). Your privacy is important to us, and our
policy is simple:  MGS will collect no personally identifiable information
about you when you visit the Site unless you choose to provide that
information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Statement addresses MGSs
practices regarding information collected only directly through or from the
Site – it does not address or govern any information gathering, use, or
dissemination practices related to information collected from the visitor
(sometimes referred to as "you" or "your") other than
directly through or from the Site, such as from telephone, facsimile, postal
mail, personal delivery, or other or additional offline means or media. This
Privacy Statement is incorporated into MGS's <i><a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/terms-of-use">Terms of
Service</a></i> by reference, as if set forth fully therein, which must be reviewed
and accepted by you. </p>

<p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors.  </b>Please
be aware that the Site is a general audience web site, not directed to children
under the age of 13, and must not be used by children under 13. MGS and the Site take important
measures to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). 
If you are the parent of a child under the age of 13 who you believe is
accessing the Site or contributing personal information wittingly or
unwittingly to MGS or the Site, please contact MGS immediately as set forth in
Section 5 below, so that we may restrict access and destroy such information.</p>

<p>Subject to the foregoing, MGS may
collect or track (1) the home server domain names, date and time of your visit,
type of computer, the originating IP address, files downloaded, search engine
used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site, (2)
the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with MGS via e-mail, (3)
information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, contest entries,
surveys, e-mail, and other online avenues (including, without limitation,
demographic and personal profile data), (4) aggregate and user-specific
information regarding which pages Site visitors access.</p>

<p>In order for you to make a purchase on the Site,
MGS may obtain financial information provided by you, including credit card
number, email and billing address and such information is only retained by our
payments processing vendor in order to process credit card payments to MGS, see
Section 3 below.</p>

<p>MGS may place Internet “cookies” on your hard drive.
Internet cookies are small amounts of data that contain a unique identifier
that many web sites frequently send to your web browser to be stored on your computerÕs
hard drive in order to save data about you, such as your name, password,
user-name, screen preferences, and the pages of a site you have viewed.  When
you revisit the Site, MGS may recognize you by your Internet cookies and
customize your experience accordingly. You may decline Internet cookies by
using the appropriate feature of your Web browser software, if available.</p>

<p>MGS may
also use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain information related to
your visit to and activity on the Site. A Web “bug” is a file object, which can
be a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel graphics file,
which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity.
A Web bug can gather, for example, the IP address of your computer, the time
the Web page was viewed, and the type of browser used.</p>


<p>When a visitor performs a search within the Site,
MGS, without limitation, may record information identifying the visitor or
linking the visitor to the search performed. MGS may also record limited
information for every search request and use that information to solve
technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in
connection with the Site and to calculate overall usage statistics.</p>


<p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of Personal Data Collected.  </b>Personal data collected by
MGS may be used by MGS for many reasons, for example, for editorial and
feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical
analysis of usersÕ behavior, for product development, for content improvement,
for fulfillment of a requested transaction or record keeping, or to customize
the content and layout of the Site. Aggregate data on visitorsÕ home servers
may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information,
such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal
information which visitors voluntarily provide to MGS may be added to MGSÕs
databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding Site updates, new
products and services, and upcoming events. The general information gathered
from a visitor is used to improve the content of Site and the quality of our
service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial
purposes, except if it becomes necessary to share information to investigate,
prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,
violations of the MGS Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>


<p><b> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Links to Other Sites and Financial
Information.  </b>The Site may also contain links to other sites or
advertisements for or placed by third parties, including sites that enable you
to purchase products. If you access a third party site from a link on this
Site, any information you disclose on that site is not subject to this Privacy
Policy. It is possible that these links may be used by third parties or others
to collect personal or other information about you. MGS is not responsible for
the privacy practices of such Web sites, advertisers, or third parties or the
content of such sites. MGS does not control these third partiesÕ use of
cookies, collection of information, or how they manage such information. The
Site does not store your financial information in order for you to purchase a
product. Instead, such financial information is maintained and housed by one or
more third-party sites. <strong>MGS uses the services of third party </strong>payment processing
centers for the purpose of processing payments made to MGS<strong>, including Shopify and Cybersource.
For information regarding Shopify, Cybersource, and their respective privacy
policies, contact <a href="mailto:privacy@shopify.com">privacy@shopify.com</a>
or Cybersource Corporation (650-965-6000).  </strong>It is solely your
obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these
other Web sites, advertisers and any third parties. </p>

<p><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Disclosure
of Personal Data to Third Parties.  </b>Personal information provided through
the Site may be used and disclosed to other entities and/or business partners
in the operation of the Site, in order to provide products and services
requested and for marketing and promotional purposes. MGS will not sell, rent,
or lease any individually identifiable information to others without your
permission. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only
share the personal data you provide to us with other MGS entities and/or
business partners who are acting on our behalf to help us provide you with our
products and services. Aggregate data on visitorsÕ home servers and
individually identifying information, such as names and e-mail addresses, may
be provided to third parties working with MGS, such as marketing firms. Any personal information submitted by you to the Site for public posting, including testimonials and comments, may be made visible and available
to MGS and/or its affiliates, licensors, visitors and customers.</p>

<p>Identifiable and non-identifiable visitor
information and data may be disclosed or distributed to another party with
which MGS enters or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as,
for example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase, or to a
third party pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal
process, in response to a request by or on behalf of any local, state, federal,
or other government agency, department, or body, whether or not pursuant to a
subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, or if determined by MGS in
its sole judgment that such disclosure or distribution is appropriate to
protect the life, health, or property of MGS or any other person or entity.</p>

<p>While MGS may undertake efforts to see that any
third party to which MGS shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal
data is under a contractual obligation to use the personal data solely for the
purposes for which the data was disclosed, such third parties are independent
third parties over which MGS exercises no control. MGS is not responsible for,
and will not be liable for, the conduct, actions, omissions, or information
handling or dissemination practices of third parties.</p>

<p><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Security
Measures and Communicating with MGS.  </b>MGS has implemented security features that are
designed to prevent the loss, misuse, alteration or unauthorized release of or
access to personal information provided to us. However, the confidentiality of
any communication or material transmitted to or from MGS via this Site or
e-mail cannot be and is not guaranteed. In addition, you understand that the
technical processing and transmission of the Site content may be transferred
unencrypted and involve <br>
(a) transmissions over various networks and (b) changes to conform and adapt to
technical requirements of connecting networks or devices. Accordingly, MGS is
not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.
Instead of communicating with MGS via e-mail (info@mountaingoatsoftware.com) or
the Internet, visitors can contact MGS by
regular mail at P.O. Box 165, Lafayette, Colorado 80026, or by phone at (720) 890-6110. </p>

<p><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Comments, Notices and User Content. 
</b>Any
material or comments posted to any of our Web pages are public. Please refer to
Sections 4 and 5 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/terms-of-use">Terms and Conditions</a></i></b>
 for further detail concerning User Content and other materials submitted to

information, no duty to update or correct such information, and no liability
for such communications arising under the laws of copyright, libel, privacy,
obscenity, or otherwise. </p>

<p><b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Opt-Out
Right.  </b>Except
as necessary for MGS to provide the services, information, or products
requested by a visitor, the visitor may opt out of having his or her personally
identifiable information, which has been voluntarily provided to MGS through online
forms, contest entries, surveys, e-mail, or another online avenue,
prospectively retained by MGS, used by MGS for secondary purposes, or disclosed
by MGS to third parties, by contacting MGS via postal mail, e-mail, or
telephone at the addresses set out above. (This does not apply to collection of
the type of Web browser of the visitor to the Site or to information provided
or collected that does not meet the description in this Section 7.)</p>

<p><b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data.  </b></p><p>Upon a visitor's request
via postal mail, e-mail, or telephone, MGS will provide to the visitor a
summary of any personally identifiable information retained by MGS regarding
the visitor that has been voluntarily provided by the visitor to MGS through online
forms, contest entries, surveys, e-mail, or another online avenue. A visitor may
modify, correct, change or update his or her personally identifiable
information by contacting MGS via postal mail, e-mail, or telephone at the addresses
or numbers above.</p>

<p><b>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right to
Change Privacy Statement.  </b>MGS may change this Privacy Statement at any time.
Notice of any new or revised Privacy Statement, as well as the location of the
new or revised statement, will be posted on the Site for at least twenty (20)
days after the change. It is the obligation of users returning to the Site to
learn of changes to the Privacy Statement since their last visit. Any change to
this Privacy Statement shall be effective as to any visitor who has visited the
Site before the change was made.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> <b>Your California Privacy Rights.  </b>If you are a California resident, California
Civil Code Section 1798.83 provides you with the right to request certain information regarding disclosure
of your personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes,
