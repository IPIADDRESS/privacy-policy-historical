              by how you've rated other Opinions or trusted/distrusted other members), 
              and then uses these experiences to dynamically sort the database 
              of Opinions for you based on those that are more likely to interest 
              you. To do this, MouthShut.com captures information about your interactions 
              with other users and then processes this information each time you 
              look for Opinions. The more you interact with others, the more personalized

        In a number of places, MouthShut.com provides 
        the option to receive an email when an activity occurs. For example, you 
        can choose to be emailed if a specific other member writes a Opinion or 
        a comment, or if a new Opinion is written on a certain product. If you 
        choose to be notified when another member writes an Opinion or comment, 
        that other member will be able to see that you've done so.</span></p>

        will need to comply. However, irrespective of those situations, MouthShut.com 
        can unilaterally turn over information about you to the government if 
        it believes such disclosure to be appropriate, in which case you authorize 
        it to do so. You also consent to MouthShut.com disclosing information 
        about you to actual or potential parties to a lawsuit that MouthShut.com 
        is or may become involved in (a) if it are required to do so, (b) if it

      <span class="BigNormalp"> Many friendships 
      have developed through the site, and MouthShut.com wants the community to 
      be vibrant and engaged. Thus, MouthShut.com is delighted when users begin 
      communicating with each other outside the context of the site. However, 
      not every user wants to engage in these types of dialogue, and MouthShut.com 
      believes each user should have the right to set the boundaries that feel 
      right to them. Thus, you may not collect, use or store any personal information 
      about other users on the site for any purpose whatsoever unless the user 
      invites you to do so. Thus, if a user displays an email address in his or 
      her personal profile, you can assume that the user is willing to receive 
      a single personal email from you that has some relation to the site. However, 
      without that user's permission, you may not contact the user about something 
      that has nothing to do with MouthShut.com, store that user's contact information 
      in a database for further communications, or continue to contact the user 
      if they have requested you not to. In all circumstances, as described in 
      the Agreement, you may not use robots, scripts or other automated procedures 
      to collect any information, including user contact information, from the 
      site. You may also not email users inviting them to join your own review 
      site under any circumstance-doing so is a theft of MouthShut.com's valuable 
      rights and an affront to users. MouthShut.com will protect its users' interests-and 
      its own interests-very vigorously in this regard.</span></p></td>

              you use this tool, the email will include your email address, as

              does not store, in any easily-retrievable way, the email addresses

              tools to send spam or to send content that would violate the Agreement. 
              Without limiting the foregoing, you may not send "Tell a Friend" 
              invitations to anyone who would not welcome the message or post
