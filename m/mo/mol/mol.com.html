                      Registration and membership services. Our registration form 
                      requires you to give us demographic information like your 
                      post code, age, and gender. We also require you to provide 
                      us with your email address so that we may contact you when 
                      appropriate or to send information about us or our services 
                      (e.g., agreement amendments or service expansions). Other 
                      demographic and profile data may also be collected through

                      to the preferences of our users. This information may be 
                      shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis (thus advertisers 
                      learn general information about our users but not individual 
                      names, e-mail addresses, etc.). <br>
                      <br>
                      For the online surveys. From time to time, we may provide 
                      you with the option to participate in online surveys that 
                      may ask you for demographic information. We, or a third 
                      party, may use your responses to send you additional information 
                      related to topics in which you have indicated an interest. 
                      If we, instead of a third party, send you additional information 
                      based on such a survey, we will always respect your e-mail 
                      or written request for us to stop sending such information. 
                      If you do not trust the third party that is conducting or 
                      affiliated with the survey, you do not have to participate 
                      in the survey. Whether you choose to participate in on-line 
                      surveys, and whether you wish to provide information to

                      <br>
                      (3) for redemption purposes; For example, if you win a prize 
                      or Benefit that needs to be physically delivered, we or 
                      one of our agents, will ask for your courier information.
