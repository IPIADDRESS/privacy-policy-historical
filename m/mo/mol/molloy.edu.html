Thank you for visiting the Molloy College Web site. This  Web site is designed to make it easier and more efficient for individuals and  businesses to interact with Molloy   College. The College  recognizes that it is critical for all audiences to be confident their privacy  is protected when they visit Molloy's Web site. <br>
<br>
Molloy College employs various measures to protect the security of its  computing resources and of users’ accounts.&nbsp;  Users should be aware, however, that Molloy College  cannot guarantee such security.&nbsp; Users  should therefore establish appropriate access restrictions for their accounts,  guarding passwords and changing them regularly.<br>
<br>
Users should also be aware that use of Molloy College’s  computing resources is not completely private.&nbsp;  While Molloy   College does not  routinely monitor individual usage of its computing resources, the normal  operation and maintenance of its computing resources require the backup and  caching of data and communications, the logging of activity, the monitoring of  usage patterns, and other such activities that are necessary for the rendition  of service.&nbsp; Molloy College may  specifically monitor the activity and accounts of individual users of its  computing resources, including individual login sessions and communications,  without notice, when (a) the user has voluntarily made them accessible to the  public, as by posting to Usenet or a web page; (b) it reasonably appears  necessary to do so to protect the integrity, security or functionality of  Molloy College or other computing resources or to protect Molloy College from  liability; (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that the user has violated,  or is violating, this policy; (d) an account appears to be engaged in unusual  or unusually excessive activity, as indicated by the monitoring of general  activity and usage patterns; or (e) it is otherwise required or permitted by  law.&nbsp; Any such individual monitoring,  other than that specified in (a), required by law, or necessary to respond to  perceived emergency situations, must be authorized in advance by Molloy  College’s Web Developer.<br>
<br>
Molloy College, in its discretion, may disclose the results of any such  general or individual monitoring, including the contents and records of  individual communications, to appropriate College personnel or law enforcement  agencies and may use those results in appropriate College disciplinary  proceedings.<br>
<br>
Consistent with the provisions of New York's Internet Security and Privacy  Act, Freedom of Information Law and Personal Privacy Protection Law, and  applicable federal laws, this policy describes Molloy's privacy practices  regarding information collected from users of this Web site. This policy  describes what information is collected and how that information is used.  Because this privacy policy applies only to this Web site, you should examine  the privacy policy of any Web site, including other educational Web sites, that  you access while using this Web site. When you link from Molloy's Web site,  please refer to the linked site's own privacy policy before you volunteer any  personal information. <br>
<br>
For purposes of this policy, "personal  information" means any information concerning a person that, because of  name, number, symbol, mark, or other identifier, can be used to identify that  person. <br>

                                      However, Molloy may collect or disclose personal  information without user consent if the collection or disclosure is: (1)  necessary to perform the statutory duties of Molloy, or necessary for Molloy to  operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal statute  or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order or by law; (3) for the  purpose of validating the identity of the user; or (4) of information to be  used solely for statistical purposes that is in a form that cannot be used to  identify any particular person. <br>

                                      If you visit this Web site to make a credit card payment on  your outstanding balance, Molloy will provide a data entry screen that  transmits your credit card information to the Web site of VeriSign, a credit  card service provider, to process the transaction. Molloy will not receive any  of your non-public, personal information. The credit card service provider  "VeriSign" will forward to Molloy only that information necessary for  Molloy to properly credit the payment to your account. For more information  about VeriSign's treatment of your non-public personal information, see the  Privacy and other policies displayed on VeriSign's Web site. </p>
									<p class="bodyText"><strong class="purple">Information Utilized When You Use TAP on the Web</strong><br>
									  Molloy's TAP on the Web may be accessed via the Federal FAFSA (Free Application  for Federal Student Aid) on the Web or by going to the URL provided by the  Molloy College Financial Aid Department on the e-mail or postcard mailed to  you. Before you begin the TAP on the Web process, your identity will be  authenticated based upon the non-public personal information you provide such  as name, Social Security Number, date of birth, etc. The authentication process  identifies who you are, provides you with a Molloy USER ID and PIN, and serves  to help safeguard your non-public personal information. </p>
									<p class="bodyText">									  If you enter Molloy's TAP on the Web via the Federal FAFSA,  the information including non-public personal information, volunteered by you  during the FAFSA process is pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. This  information includes your name, Social Security Number, income, marital status,  et al. and that of your spouse and your parent(s). Non- public personal  information you provide during the TAP on the Web process is used to determine  your eligibility and award amounts under the TAP program, and to verify data.  Access to this information is limited to Molloy staff that require access to  perform their official duties and to staff with security access, as initiated  by a designated school official.<br>
									  Most of this personal information is retained indefinitely by Molloy as part of  your academic record.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your name, date of birth, and Social Security Number, however, are retained in  perpetuity.<br>
								      <br>
									  Failure to provide FAFSA with all information necessary to process your TAP on  the Web application will result in an inability to process your TAP  application. You may apply for TAP via a paper TAP application [available at the  Molloy College Financial Aid office].</p>
									<p class="bodyText"><strong class="purple">Information Collected When You Register for Workshops or  Events on This Web Site</strong> <br>
									  If, during your visit to this Web site, you register for a workshop  or an event, the information, including personal information, volunteered by  you is used by Molloy to enroll you in the workshop or event, and to provide  you with your requested information. Access to this information is limited to Molloy  staff who require access to perform their official duties. This information  will not be collected for commercial purposes and Molloy is not authorized to  sell or otherwise disclose your e-mail address for commercial purposes. </p>
