			<p>We at Moda Operandi have created this Privacy Policy because we know you care about how information you provide us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy describes how we gather information from you when you visit the Moda Operandi web site located at www.modaoperandi.com (the “Site”), and how we may use and share that information. By visiting our Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, the words “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Moda Operandi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong><br>
Personal Information. Personal Data is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you (collectively, “Personal Data”). Such Personal Data may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date (primarily for eligibility purposes).</p>
<p>Billing Information. If you wish to purchase a product or service through the Site, you will be required to provide certain information in addition to the Personal Information noted above. Such information may include a credit card number, PayPal account number, and similar information (collectively, “Billing Information).</p>
<p>Other Information and Cookies. In addition to the Personal and Billing Information noted above that you voluntarily provide to us, we may collect additional information (collectively, “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include (i) information that we automatically collect when you visit the Site, such as your IP addresses, Internet service provider, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Site you visit, number of links you click while in the Site, and similar information concerning your use of the Site; and (ii) additional information that you voluntarily provide to us regarding your use and interest in our programs, offers, products, and services.</p>
<p>Other Information also includes information that we collect using “cookie” technology. Cookies are bits of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies can enhance your online experience by automatically saving your preferences. We use cookies because they help us to provide to you a better online experience. The information we collect through the use of cookies allows Moda Operandi to determine when and for how long you logged on to the Site, so that we can try to understand how to better serve your needs. If you object to the use of cookies for any reason, you may set your Internet browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it. If you decline to receive cookies, you may have difficulty using certain features of the Site.</p>
<p>In order to use our Site, you will be required to complete a membership form and become a member (“Member”). As part of this registration process, you will be required to provide us with Personal Data. We will also request Personal Data and Billing Information from you when you make a purchase on our Site or in connection with other online promotions that we may make available on our Site from time to time. In all of these cases, we will collect Personal Data and Billing Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personal Data or Billing Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong><br>
Moda Operandi uses the Personal Data and Billing Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data or Billing Information for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data or Billing Information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, we will use the Personal Data you input during the registration process to administer access to the Site and to facilitate purchases from the Site. Moda Operandi also uses your Personal Data and other non-personally identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site and to better understand the Members and other users of our Site. If Moda Operandi intends on using any Personal Data or Billing Information in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data or Billing Information is collected, or, if you have not been so informed, we will inform you and obtain your consent after collection but before use.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Data</strong><br>
Moda Operandi may store non-personally identifiable information or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by Moda Operandi’s affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Information</strong><br>
Moda Operandi is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data or Billing Information with certain third parties without notice to you including those set forth below:</p>
<p>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Moda Operandi, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. For example, we may pass your credit card information and related personally identifiable information to our designated service provider(s) in order to process payments, ship products, send mailings, and maintain databases. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them only with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
<p>Advertisers. Moda Operandi may aggregate your Personal Data with Personal Data of other Members and users, and disclose such information to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
<p>Activities and Events. Moda Operandi may sponsor promotions, sweepstakes or contests directly or through third parties, or Moda Operandi may enter into collaborative relationships with other third parties on the Site. If you participate in these activities or events, you may be asked to provide Personal Data or to answer questions that seek your personal information. Moda Operandi may transfer your Personal Data to third parties in conjunction with such activities or events.</p>
<p>Legal Requirements: Moda Operandi may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Moda Operandi, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Members or other users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
<p>Invite a Friend: If you provide Moda Operandi with a friend’s email address through the “Invite a Friend” feature of our Site, Moda Operandi will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to join the site. Moda Operandi stores this email address for the purpose of sending the invitation. Moda Operandi will not sell the email address or use it to send any other communication other than the invitation. Please do not provide any email address to Moda Operandi (through the “Invite a Friend” feature or otherwise) unless you believe that the owner of the email address would be interested in receiving an invitation email from Moda Operandi.</p>
<p>Information Collected on this Site that is NOT Covered by this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We feature or may in the future feature public forums such as chat rooms, message boards, bulletin boards, user reviews, virtual closets, and similar activities where you and other users of our Site can communicate with one another (collectively, “Public Forums”). THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY INFORMATION (INCLUDING PERSONAL DATA) YOU POST IN ANY PUBLIC FORUMS ON OUR SITE. ALL SUCH INFORMATION IS PUBLIC INFORMATION AND MAY BE SEEN, COLLECTED OR USED BY ANYONE, INCLUDING THIRD PARTIES NOT AFFILIATED WITH MODA OPERANDI. You should think carefully before disclosing any information in any Public Forum on our Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Removal From Mailing List.</strong><br>
If at any time you decide that you would like to stop receiving communications from us, please email your request to: <a href="mailto:support@modaoperandi.com">support@modaoperandi.com</a>. Once we receive your request, we will take reasonable efforts to promptly remove you from our mailing list. Please be aware that users cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails related to their account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important Notice to Non-U.S. Residents</strong><br>
The Site is operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using the Site and/or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>California Residents</strong><br>
Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who have an established business relationship with us may choose to opt out of our sharing your Personal Information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and you have already granted us this permission and (1) you now wish to opt out; or (2) you wish to request certain information regarding our disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for the direct marketing purposes, please contact us as described below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Special Note Regarding Children</strong><br>
The Site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and will not knowingly register or otherwise collect Personal Information from any child under the age of 13. We ask that minors (under the age of 13) not submit any Personal Information to us. If you are under the age of 13, you may use the Site only with the consent of your parent or guardian. If a child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us, by visiting the “Contact Us” section of this Site, and request that such information be deleted from our records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong><br>
This Privacy Policy applies only to this Site and not to any Third Party Sites or any other Moda Operandi Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection and distribution policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
We have reasonable security measures in place intended to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Data that we have collected from you at the Site. However, we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your Personal Data will remain secure under all circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong><br>
This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post any changes on our Site as soon as they go into effect. Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we use the information. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.</p>
