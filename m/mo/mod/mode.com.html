          <div class="content-text">
            To help protect the privacy of data we collect through the Service, we employ measures intended to be consistent with industry best practices for security and encryption in data transmission and storage. However, you should keep in mind that the Site and the Service are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control. We process payments securely using an industry-accepted Payment Gateway, and do not store any billing information on our own servers.

          <div class="content-text">
            Mode will retain your personal information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that we may also be required to retain your personal information for legal and accounting reasons. In addition, for our records, we may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, fraud prevention, troubleshooting and agreement enforcement, or in other cases where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. In particular, Mode will retain your personal information for as long as required to service the needs of our customers; for instance, to allow a customer to determine which of its employees created a particular report on the Mode platform, or to allow customers to reactivate their accounts with Mode.

            At this time, Mode does not support “Do Not Track” preferences that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information. Specifically, if you turn on the Do Not Track setting on your browser, the Service and the Site are not currently capable of following whatever Do Not Track preferences you set. Currently no common industry or legal standard for Do Not Track has been adopted by industry groups. We will make efforts to monitor developments around Do Not Track browser technology and the implementation of a standard. For more information about Do Not Track, visit donottrack.us.

            Finally, EU residents may seek redress for their complaint using a binding arbitration mechanism, provided they have taken the following steps: (1) raised their complaint directly with us and provided us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) made use of the independent dispute resolution mechanism identified above; and (3) raised the issue through the relevant data protection authority and allowed the U.S. Department of Commerce an opportunity to resolve the complaint.
