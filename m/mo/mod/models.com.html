				<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b> <br>
				  To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. </font><br>
				</p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ADVERTISERS ON MODELS.COM</b><br>
				  All users accessing the MODELS.com Web site, and viewing advertisements on MODELS.com's Web pages, retain complete anonymity where MODELS.com is concerned. As ads are delivered, MODELS.com does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. MODELS.com does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. MODELS.com servers note details such as the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of MODELS.com advertising clients and customers. </font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Cookie Principle</b><br>
				  MODELS.com may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. When you first access a MODELS.com Web page with or without an ad on it, MODELS.com or its advertising client may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to measure the popularity of the different sections of the site, and to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this number lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute or which articles on the site are more popular. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over and can also help us improve the MODELS.com Web site content and features based on users's actual usage of the site - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience.  If you refuse a cookie, you can still use MODELS.com but your experience may differ from those individuals using cookies.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3rd Party Measurement Services</b><br>
				  Often, advertisers will employ a third-party measurement service other than MODELS.com for tracking the performance of an ad program. In these instances, MODELS.com has no control over the information collected by the third party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third party measurement service where collected information is concerned. If you have questions regarding different third party measurement services and their respective methods of information collection, please contact feedback@models.com. </font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Disclosure</b><br>
				  MODELS.com openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities, and its use of cookies. If you have any questions pertaining to this privacy policy and its contents, please direct your correspondence to <a href="mailto:feedback@models.com">feedback@models.com</a>. <br>
				  <br>
				  MODELS.com reserves the right to amend this Privacy Statement at any time without notice, and only the current Privacy Statement may be deemed effective. Regardless of later updates or changes to our
				  privacy notice, we will never use the information you submit under our
				  current privacy notice in a new way without first providing you an
				  opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use.<br>
				  This Privacy notice was last updated on January 31st 2001 and is deemed effective as of this date.
