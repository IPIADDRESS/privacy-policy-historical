<b>PRIVACY STATEMENT<br>

MODERNMAN.COM<br>

and<br>

MODERN MAN BOOKS</b>

</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>Because Modern Man Books and its website at modernman.com wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and has agreed to notify you of:</p>



<p>1.      What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site<br>

2.      The organization collecting the information <br>

3.      How the information is used <br>

4.      With whom the information may be shared <br>

5.      What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information <br>

6.      The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the control of Modern Man Books.<br>

7.      How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</p>



<p>If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, contact Modern Man Books by mail at 116 W. Jefferson St., Mankato KS 66956 or by email to <a href="mailto:info@modernman.com">info@modernman.com</a>.</p>



<p><b>Information Collection and Use</b></p>



<p>Modern Man Books is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  Modern Man Books collects information from our users at several different points on our website.</p>



<p><b>Registration</b></p>



<p>In order to use some resources of this website or to enter contests or to participate in some site programs and contests, a user must first complete a registration form.  During registration a user is required to give his contact information (generally, his email address).  This information is used to notify winners or to contact the user about the services, contests, resources, or programs on our site for which they have expressed interest.  In some cases, we may ask for demographic information (such as income level or gender), but it's always optional for users to provide demographic information, but it's encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.</p>



<p><b>Order</b></p>



<p>We request information from the user on our order form.  A customer must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date, billing address).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill a customer’s order.  If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the customer.</p>



<p><b>Cookies</b></p>



<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site -- or, for that matter, while off our site.  Once the user closes his browser, the cookie simply terminates.  Generally, cookies exist for the convenience of users. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, a user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, he may still use our site -- but he will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or Drawings. Cookies can also enable us to target the interests of our users to enhance the experience of our site.</p>



<p>We have no access to or control over the cookies used by our business partners (for example, advertisers).</p>



<p><b>Log Files</b></p>



<p>We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We have no interest whatsoever in obtaining any personally identifiable information about a user unless it is supplied by the user voluntarily -- for example, in a registration process.</p>



<p><b>Sharing</b></p>



<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>



<p>We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>



<p>We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.</p>



<p>These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>



<p><b>Links</b></p>



<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [Modern Man Books] are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects any personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>



<p><b>Newsletter</b></p>



<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.</p>



<p><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b></p>



<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, or age level).  Contact information will be used to notify winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>



<p><b>Security</b></p>



<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p>



<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as when you are just ‘surfing’.</p>



<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online in the course of doing transactions from our storefront, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.</p>



<p>If you have any questions about privacy and security at our website, send an email to <a href="mailto:info@modernman.com">info@modernman.com</a>.</p>



<p><b>Supplementation of Information</b></p>



<p>In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it may be necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from third-party sources.</p>



<p><b>Special Offers</b></p>



<p>In some cases, we may send all new registrants a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and/or a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.</p>



<p><b>Site and Service Updates</b></p>



<p>We may also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We may communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email.</p>



<p><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b></p>



<p>If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:customersupport@modernman.com">customersupport@modernman.com</a>.</p>



<p><b>Choice/Opt-out</b></p>



<p>Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.</p>



<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by sending a message to emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:customersupport@modernman.com">customersupport@modernman.com</a> with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line of the email.</p>



<p>Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</p>



<p><b>Notification of Changes</b></p>



<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p><!--/content-->
