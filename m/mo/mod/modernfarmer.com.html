<p><strong>Protecting Your Privacy and Servicing Your Needs</strong><br>
Modern Farmer is a quarterly magazine devoted to the people, policy, issues, animals plant and technology of farming and food. We bring you the ideas, insights and information that inspire and enable people to improve their lives and the world around them. We value integrity, and we’re deeply committed to protecting your privacy and the security of the information you share with us.</p>
<p>We believe you have the right to know everything regarding the information we collect about you, how this information benefits you, and how you can say “no” to the use of any of this information.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies to all information gathering activities of Modern Farmer Media, on and offline. The policy describes how we handle information provided to us or collected on Internet sites where this privacy policy is posted. It also explains how we handle information provided to us or collected on applications we make available on or through third-party sites or platforms, if it is disclosed to you in connection with your use, purchase or download of the application.</p>
<p><strong>Children Under 13</strong><br>
We care about the safety of children. We won’t knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personal identifying information. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as, their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved in your children’s online experience and to share your interest in our sites with your young ones.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection</strong><br>
Modern Farmer Media collects personal identifying information (“PII”) from you when you visit our website(s), through e-mail, and through the use of our mobile applications. We also collect PII during transactions, sponsored events and contests/sweepstakes. PII includes your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone and cell phone numbers, wireless service provider, and all other information that identifies you.</p>
<p>We may collect information about your interaction with Modern Farmer Media sites, applications and services. For example, we may use website analytics tools on our site to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser’s width and height. We may also use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described below); to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on our sites and services. Additionally, we may collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring website addresses.</p>
<p>When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from Modern Farmer Media, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.</p>
<p>In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Modern Farmer Media, information collected through one Modern Farmer Media site, application or service may be combined with information obtained through other Modern Farmer Media sites, applications or services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong><br>
The information we collect allows us to customize the content and/or layout of our sites and applications for you and each other visitor. Plus, it enables us to notify you about updates to our websites and applications, contact you with special offers of interest, and customize your experience.<br>
In addition, Modern Farmer Media may make certain PII and other information available to trusted third parties that work with us to provide products and services to our customers, that help us with marketing campaigns, or that intend to market products and services to you directly. These companies are obligated to protect the information they receive.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong><br>
As described above, from time to time, we make your PII available to third parties. If you do not want us to share your PII with other companies or organizations, you may opt-out of this information sharing by doing any one of the following: email us at customerservice@moderfarmermedia.com or writing to us at Privacy Request, Modern Farmer Media., 403 Warren Street, Hudson, New York, 12534.

Modern Farmer Media may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request. If there is a change of control in Modern Farmer Media (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or a sale or transfer of its assets, your information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your PII and other information potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said information.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Modern Farmer Media is located in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and will process and store your information in the U.S., and that as a result, U.S. governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Devices/Third Party Fees</strong><br>
From time to time, Modern Farmer Media may make mobile device application and mobile marketing campaigns available to you and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or e-mails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services and that access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the use of the applications, delivery of the messages, e-mails or other materials to your mobile device. Please consult your mobile service provider’s pricing plan prior to purchasing or downloading any application or registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving text messages from/to your mobile device. You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving text messages or emails to your mobile device at the time you register and with each message or email you receive.</p>
<p>Mobile marketing campaigns may involve your sending an e-mail from your mobile device to Modern Farmer Media or a third-party campaign operator. An e-mail or other response will then be sent to your mobile device. Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice.

<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br>
We may use third-party advertising, data analytics and online targeting companies to serve ads when you visit our sites or use our applications. We may also provide certain PII and other information to these third-parties to allow them to more effectively target advertising to you. These companies are obligated to protect your information, but you may opt-out of this sharing through the process described here.</p>
<p>When advertisements are displayed to you on our sites and applications, one or more persistent cookies may be placed on your computer or device by us or a third party.

Modern Farmer Media has no control over the third-party sponsor’s use of this information. The Modern Farmer Media site will notify you at the time of requesting PII if third-party sponsors will be provided with such information.</p>
