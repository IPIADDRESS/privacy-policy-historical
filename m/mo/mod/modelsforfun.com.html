			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>This document details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User Data collected on HomeClips.com
			<br>
			The security of your Data is very important to us, and as such we take all appropriate steps to limit the risk that it may be lost, damaged or misused.
			 <br>
			This site expressly and strictly limits its membership and/or viewing privileges to adults 18 years of age and over or having attained the age of majority in their community. All persons who do not meet its criteria are strictly forbidden from accessing or viewing the contents of this Site. We do not knowingly seek or collect any personal information or data from persons who have not attained the age of majority. We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you and your payment method to process transactions only. Private account and address information is necessary to verify that you are the person making the purchase and to thwart potential fraud. All information gathered in the course of a transaction is transmitted securely and is protected by our database throughout the transaction process. By visiting our website or otherwise interacting with network, you agreed to accept the practices described in this Privacy Statement.
			<br>
			<br>
			WE WILL NEVER PROVIDE YOUR INFORMATION TO ANOTHER PARTY AND WE WILL NEVER SOLICIT YOU.
			<br>
			<br>
			Please read on for more details about our privacy statement.</p>
			<h2>1. What information do we collect? How do we use it?</h2>
			<p>When you register, we need to know your name, e-mail address, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, mailing address, phone number and payment information. This allows us to safely process and fulfill your purchase process, as well as to notify you of your delivery status. We log the IP address for address verification purposes. However, the "IP" address is never used for any other purpose than to process your purchase.
			<br>
			<br>
			WE ONLY USE THE INFORMATION TO PROCESS, CONFIRM AND NOTIFY YOU OF THE SPECIFIC PURCHASE YOU ARE MAKING.</p>
			<h2>2. How does RedClouds protect customer information?</h2>
			<p>When you purchase a product with us, we use an internal secure network. This network encrypts all information between the servers of RedClouds. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.</p>
			<h2>3. What about "cookies"?</h2>
			<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as linking and reselling. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Sometimes at RedClouds we do use cookies during the purchase process, to have your own PC remember what kind of information was entered.

These communications are intended to inform you of important information regarding your account or about general services provided by us. Only in rare circumstances will RedClouds contact consumers via telephone to confirm purchase or resolve disputes.</p>
