          <ul>
            <li class="content-text"><span>
              The "public" function enables users to publicly share data with all users of the Service, as well as queries and associated data analyses, and to access, manipulate and collaborate on the data, queries and data analyses shared with the public function by other users.
            </span></li>
            <li class="content-text"><span>
              The "private" function enables users of each private group to share data, as well as queries and associated data analyses, only with other authorized users of that particular private group, and to access, manipulate and collaborate on the data, queries and data analyses shared by such other users of such private group.  The private function is only available for registered users of the premium Service.

            When you register for the premium Service, which is available for a fee and is described more fully in our <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>, we may collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information and shipping information.

This may include a photo of you, a short bio, links to your presence on other social media sites, and other information that you think other users might want to know about you. Please keep in mind that all information that you submit for display in your profile, including any personal information, will be viewable by other users of the Service.

            As described in the Privacy Shield Principles, Mode is accountable for personal data that it receives and subsequently transfers to third parties.  If third parties that process personal data on our behalf do so in a manner that does not comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are accountable, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

          <div class="content-text">
            To help protect the privacy of data we collect through the Service, we employ measures intended to be consistent with industry best practices for security and encryption in data transmission and storage. However, you should keep in mind that the Site and the Service are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.

            We process payments securely using an industry-accepted Payment Gateway, and do not store any billing information on our own servers.

          <div class="content-text">
            You may correct or update information that we collect about you by managing your account on the Service in the Settings section. This includes the addition or removal of personal information (except your name, email address, username and password, which we require of all users to maintain their accounts), as well as preferences for the types of communications you receive from us. You may also access the information Mode holds on you by contacting us at support@modeanalytics.com.

          <div class="content-text">
            For our records, we may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting and agreement enforcement. In addition, we are not responsible for updating or removing any information about you collected through the Site or the Service already disclosed to third parties who have been provided information as described in this Privacy Policy.

          <div class="content-text">
            At this time, Mode does not support “Do Not Track” preferences that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information. Specifically, if you turn on the Do Not Track setting on your browser, the Service and the Site are not currently capable of following whatever Do Not Track preferences you set.

            This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information collected from you by Mode through this Site or the Service. You should be aware that when you are using the Site or the Service, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control or be interfacing with third-party integrated services. We would expect most, if not all, of these third parties will collect information about you when you use their offerings. However, Mode is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, regardless whether they are linked or otherwise connected to this Site or the Service. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy whenever interacting with any third-party website or other offering.
