    <h1>Moat Privacy Policy</h1>
  </header>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <p>At Moat, we are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information.  It’s yours, it matters to you and we get that.  This Privacy Policy is to let you know what information we use and collect from users of www.Moat.com and other Moat URLs and websites (“Sites”), any of our services (“Services”), and on behalf of our clients.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is subject to the Terms of Service posted on the Sites.  By using our Sites or Services, you expressly consent to Moat’s collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.   Please note that if you disagree with anything in this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Sites or the Services.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>Information Collected From Our Sites and Services</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><u>Automatic Collection</u>: Like most web businesses, we use automated mechanisms such as <i>cookies</i> to keep track of users interactions with the Sites and the Services.  This may include your <i>Internet protocol address, referring website address, browser</i> type and access times.  We refer to this type of data as "anonymous" user information.  A glossary that explains each of these italicized terms is included at the end of this Privacy Policy.  We also use third party analytics such as Google Analytics to gather and analyze anonymous user information.</li>
      <li><u>Volunteered</u>:  If you open an account with us, purchase products or services, send us an email, or share personal information with us in any other way, we collect the information you share.  This obviously depends on what information you choose to provide but it may include your name, email address or billing information.  You do not have to share this information with us, but without it you may not be able to access certain content or features or use certain Services.</li>
      <li><u>Posted</u>: If you post information on public areas of the Sites (or elsewhere on the Internet) that information may be collected and used by anyone, including Moat.  (We strongly recommend that you do not post any information that allows strangers to identify or locate you.   Posting such information may result in unsolicited and unwanted contact from others, to say the least.)</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>Client Services</h1>
    <p>We offer Services that help our clients understand how users interact with online advertising.  In connection with online ads, we may use automated mechanisms to gather anonymous user information ourselves, we may analyze and share that information with our clients and their business partners, and we may facilitate our clients' direct gathering of such information.   We ask our clients to disclose their own data collection and third party data collection in their privacy policies.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</h1>
    <p>The short answer is that we generally use this information to help Moat provide you with better service and to help our advertisers and clients provide you with more relevant offers, which in turn helps cover the cost of providing our Sites and our Services and third party websites and services.  Among other things, the information we collect can enable Moat to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>customize the content and advertising you see</li>
      <li>fulfill your requests for Services and validate your user rights</li>
      <li>contact and communicate with you</li>
      <li>conduct research and analysis on behalf of Moat and/or Moat's clients</li>
      <li>provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients</li>
      <li>provide you with additional information we think is of interest to you</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>When Do We Share or Disclose Your Information?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Anonymous Information.</b>  We may freely share anonymous user information with others, such as clients, advertisers, sponsors and business partners.</li>
      <li><b>Personally Identifiable Information.</b>  In more limited circumstances, we may share personally identifiable information we have collected.  For example:
	<ul>
	  <li>We might share personally identifiable information during due diligence or in connection with a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation.</li>
	  <li>If you give us permission, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties who may send you marketing and promotional information.</li>
	  <li>Your personal information may be transferred to anyone who is helping us make the Sites and Services available and functional, like technical agents, payment processing vendors, other subcontractors, and our affiliates and consultants.</li>
	  <li>As in any transaction, if you provide your credit card information to us for purchases, your credit card company will be provided with relevant information about us, services purchased, cost and other information necessary to process the transaction.</li>
	  <li>We may disclose your personal information if permitted or required by law, or where we believe such action is necessary in order to protect or defend our interests or the interests of our users or business partners.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>Children Under 13</h1>
    <p>The Sites are not intended for children under age 13, or for anyone under age 18 without involvement of a parent or guardian.  The Sites may include unmonitored content posted by users or sourced from other third parties and such content may be unsuitable for children.   We do not knowingly collect or distribute information from or about children under 13.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>Third Parties</h1>
    <p>Like most (maybe all) websites, third parties may directly gather anonymous user information from users of our Sites through automated means such as cookies.   For example, companies who place ads on our Sites may set their own cookies or use other automated mechanisms that gather anonymous user information.   This Privacy Policy does not cover how third parties gather and use such data.</p>
    <p>In addition, the Sites and Services may contain links to third party websites and content, over which Moat has no control.  These third parties' privacy policies may be different from our Privacy Policy, and you access such linked websites or third party content at your own risk.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>Security</h1>
    <p>Any information collected by Moat is stored on servers that Moat manages, using standard security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information.  Please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, Moat cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Sites or Services and you do so at your own risk.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>Foreign Countries</h1>
    <p>Your personal information may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your country.  If you are located outside of the United States, please be advised that Moat processes and stores information in the United States and your use of our Sites or Services constitutes your consent to and understanding of this processing.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>Changes to Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Moat reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, and will do so by posting changes to this Privacy Policy on the Sites.  The new Privacy Policy may apply to current and past users of the Sites, as specified in the changed Privacy Policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>Dispute Resolution</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and performed in New York, excluding the application of the conflict of laws provisions.  You agree that any action or suit brought by a party to enforce or adjudicate your rights under this Agreement shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in New York, New York.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="copyblock">
    <h1>California Residents</h1>

That notice will identify the categories of information shared, the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, and their names and addresses.

    <h1>Glossary</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Cookie</i>: a cookie is essentially a reminder – it tells the cookie owner when a website or ad is being viewed by a user who has been there before.  (Technically speaking, a cookie is a small electronic file containing a string of characters that a server places on your computer when you visit a site or view an ad.)  When you visit the Sites or use our online products or services, Moat’s servers send a cookie to your computer.  Cookies by themselves do not identify you personally.  Unless you choose to identify yourself to us (eg, by opening an account), you will remain anonymous to us.  Most web browsers accept cookies by default but you can change that setting (instructions should be provided within your browser itself).  However, if you disable cookies, certain features of the Sites and Services may not work.  Moat, its business partners, its clients and their business partners may use other technologies to collect anonymous user information in addition to cookies (eg, web beacons, tracking pixels and Flash technology) but we thought it would not be very useful to define them all here.   You can find a great deal of information about these mechanisms online and if you really need help, ask us and we will point you to some good resources.</li>
      <li><i>Internet protocol address</i>:  an individual "name" that is assigned to each computer on the Internet, so that each computer can be told apart.</li>
      <li><i>Referring website address</i>:  the domain name or URL of the webpage you were visiting right before you came to the Sites.</li>
      <li><i>Browser</i>: is the software application on your computer that lets you "see" websites.  Common browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera and Apple Safari. </li>
