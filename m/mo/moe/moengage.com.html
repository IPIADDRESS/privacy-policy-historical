                        We obtain information about End Users to provide App Providers with behavioral and analytics data related to how End Users interact with their products and services (the “Applications”). We do not directly get personal information from End Users; we collect information using tracking code technology that App Providers install in their Applications and share with us pursuant to their information collection practices, which are typically outlined in a privacy policy like this one and made available on the App Provider’s website. We encourage all End Users to read the privacy policies of the Applications they access or use. The App Providers provide us with the following types of information about End Users:

                    <p class="para">
                        When an App Provider embeds our tracking code into its Applications, we access or obtain Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) such as an End User’s email address, name, and phone number, depending on the selections the applicable App Provider makes via the MoEngage Software Development Kits (the “SDKs”).
                        We also access or obtain additional information about End Users’ use of App Providers’ Applications and End Users’ devices, such as the actions taken, content viewed, messages viewed, messages clicked, offers accepted, search terms entered, advertisements clicked, applications opened, applications sent to the background, transactions in which an End User engaged, application name, application version, application bundle identifier, operating system name, operating system version, unique device identifiers, IP addresses, and access date, time, and location information.
                        Please ensure you read, understand, and accept the privacy policies, and any terms of use of the App Provider that uses the MoEngage Service. By using our Service, you expressly relieve MoEngage from any and all liability arising from your use of the App Providers service. We analyze and use this information to provide and improve the MoEngage Service. MoEngage collects information under the direction of our App Providers, and has no direct relationship with the End Users whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our App Providers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our App Providers that use the MoEngage Service, please contact the App Provider directly. If the App Provider fails to respond to your request within 30 days, you may contact us with your request at <a href="mailto: privacy@moengage.com">privacy@moengage.com</a>.
