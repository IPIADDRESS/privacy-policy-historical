             <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	  <p>The Media Innovation Group, LLC is firmly  committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering user  confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. Accordingly,  we are committed to observing applicable industry guidelines, including those  established by the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp">Network  Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.iab.net/">Interactive  Advertising Bureau</a>.&nbsp; We continually  evaluate innovative ways to protect online user privacy while also offering our  clients the ability to own and use information regarding their interactions  with their customers.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Our services and products are described at <a href="http://www.themig.com/products.php">http://www.themig.com/products.php</a> ("<a href="http://www.themig.com/">Services</a>”).&nbsp; The next few sections below describe how we  collect user information in connection with the operation of our Services for or  by our clients, such as through advertisements that may appear on various  websites on the Internet.&nbsp; Certain information collected by the Media  Innovation Group through the use of cookies used in the Services, as described  below, may occur on numerous websites across the Internet.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>
	    This Privacy Policy applies only to the website  on which it appears, and not to any other website or service.&nbsp; This  Privacy Policy also provides information about activities we undertake across Internet  websites on behalf of our clients.&nbsp; </p>
	  <h1>
	    <strong>For information on how we collect and use  information that is collected directly from you on this website, please see the  section entitled “Your Correspondence on this Website.”</strong> </h1>
	  <h1>
	    <strong>Information We Collect Through our Services</strong></h1>
<p class="underline">We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
		<p>We  do not collect the online user's personally identifiable information  ("PII") from users online through advertisements we manage on  behalf of our clients. &nbsp;PII generally refers to information such as an  individual's name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.</p>
<p class="underline">Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services</p>
		<p>We do collect non-personally  identifiable information (“Non-PII) to identify browsers that we have  interacted with before. &nbsp;For instance, by  using Non-PII, we may be able to identify a browser that has previously seen an  advertisement we launched on behalf of a client.&nbsp; In the context of  Non-PII, whenever we refer to ‘you’ or ‘yours,’ please remember that we may be  referring to a certain browser and not an identifiable person since we  generally do not know who is using a browser at any particular time. </p>
		<p>
	    Through  the collection and use of Non-PII, we offer a range of Services to allow  advertisers to show you the most useful and relevant online advertisements. You  can learn more about these advertising practices by visiting <a href="http://www.iab.net/privacymatters">www.iab.net/privacymatters</a> or the “Learn More” section of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/learn_more.asp">Network Advertising Initiative</a>.</p>
		<p>
		  We  may collect Non-PII regarding your online behavior and usage patterns through  advertisements operated by our clients to better customize the type of  advertisements you see on various sites.&nbsp; Non-PII consists of aggregated  information, demographic information (i.e., the country from which you are  connecting to the Internet) and other information such as the type of Internet  browser used by an online user, a user's computer's Internet protocol  ("IP”) address, the type of computer operating system used, the domain  name of the websites visited before and after viewing an advertisement, as well  as information related to websites and web pages a user is viewing when an  advertisement is shown which does not specifically reveal a user's identity.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
		  We  collect Non-PII through the use of cookies, pixels and related technology. &nbsp;No PII is collected or used in this process. A  cookie is a file on your browser that uniquely identifies your browser and  computer. &nbsp;A pixel is a line of code  which is used by a website or third party ad server to track a user's  activity.&nbsp; The use of a pixel allows us to record that a user has visited  a particular webpage and to collect additional Non-PII that an advertiser may  choose to request through the pixel. &nbsp;We  may use cookies and pixels for planning, serving, analyzing and managing online  marketing and advertising campaigns on behalf of our clients. &nbsp;Non-PII that is collected through our pixels,  cookies and related technology will be retained for up to fourteen (14) months,  at which time it will be purged from our system.</p>
		<p>
		  Though Non-PII does  not personally identify anyone, we are still committed to giving users the  opportunity to exercise choice about the Non-PII we collect.&nbsp;&nbsp;See the  Section titled, “User Choice – Opting-Out of Receiving Cookies.”<strong> </strong></p>
<p class="underline">Sensitive Information</p>
		<p>We  do not knowingly collect or utilize sensitive information. Sensitive  information may include information such as confidential or medical  information, religious beliefs and other similar or related information.</p>
<h1>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h1>
		<p>We  do not collect PII via our technology and our client's advertisements, and  therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share PII collected on through our Services  with non-affiliated third parties. </p>
		<p>
		  We  may disclose Non-PII collected through our Services, and information derived  from it, to our clients, vendors and partners. &nbsp;This Non-PII may be used to deliver tailored  ads to users on participating websites and for other purposes as described  above. This information does not include any PII that can be used to contact or  identify any person individually. Further, we encourage our clients, as  applicable, to use any Non-PII they receive in compliance with applicable laws  and regulations and to publish privacy policies that tell you about how the  information they are gathering is being used.&nbsp; We urge you to always read  the privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand issues relating to  your online privacy. </p>
		<p>
		  We may disclose a user’s Non-PII to  third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and  in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual  prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations  involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. &nbsp;In addition, if permitted by applicable law,  we may also disclose and provide access to a user’s Non-PII to our vendors and  contractors who are performing services on our behalf.&nbsp; However, such  vendors and contractors are not permitted to use such user information for any  purpose other than providing services to us. </p>
<h1>User Choice - Opting Out of Receiving Cookies</h1>
		<p>We  use technology, includes cookies and pixels, in the delivery of our  Services.&nbsp; We believe that the use of these tools enables us and our  advertiser clients to provide users with a more meaningful web experience.</p>
		<p>
		  At  all times, you may adjust your computer's web browser settings to refuse all  cookies.&nbsp; However, by doing so, you may  not be able to enjoy or use certain features on the websites you visit or take  full advantage of all the website offerings and interest based advertising. You  can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's  "help" file.</p>
		<p>
		  You  may also simply opt out of receiving customized advertisements provided by the  Media Innovation Group and the collection of Non-PII in connection with  the advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients. &nbsp;Of course, doing this means that you would no  longer receive customized advertisements delivered through the Media Innovation Group’s proprietary  technology. &nbsp;To opt-out of our Non-PII  collection, click here: </p>

<h1>Data Retention</h1>
		<p>We may use our anonymous cookie information for  advertising purposes for up to 14 months.&nbsp; Aggregate reports generated  from this information may be kept longer.</p>
