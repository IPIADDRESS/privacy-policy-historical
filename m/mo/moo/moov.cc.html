Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside your home country; by using Moov’s products and services you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Moov will not rent or sell potentially-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c4">Other Information </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Non-Identifiable Data:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;When you interact with Moov through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Moov may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Moov affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Aggregated Personal Data: </span><span class="c2">In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Moov often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Moov may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Moov may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Location Information:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Our Service may collect and use your location information (for example, by using the GPS on your mobile device) to provide certain functionality of our Service. If you choose to enable our location features, your location information may be publicly displayed within the Service. Please keep in mind that other users can see this information about you, and they may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities outside of our control and without your knowledge. Your location information may be subject to abuse, misuse, and monitoring by others, so please be careful if you choose to enable location functionality.
