<p align="center">Moody's Investors Service Data Protection Practices (as of September 1998)</p>


<font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

For more than 90 years, Moody's Investors Service has collected information on businesses and fixed income securities to create products and services that assist investors and the capital markets by providing independent, objective credit opinions and analysis.<p>    

Recognizing that the free flow of the information must be balanced against a company's concern about the confidentiality of information given to Moody's analysts as part of the rating process, Moody's developed data protection practices at its inception.  The fundamental principles of those data protection practices still apply to our traditional ratings process.  Moody's subscribes to the practices described below.</p></font><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
</font>

</p><p align="center">Data Protection Practices
for the Internet</p><p>
<font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

Driven by requests from customers, Moody's delivers products and services through the Internet faster and more efficiently than ever before.  Many of the measurable benefits derived from Moody's products and services are a result of the ability to freely move information.  Moody's recognizes that the free flow of information must be balanced against an individual's privacy interests.  The company also believes the adoption of balanced data protection practices for the Internet makes good business sense.  Therefore, Moody's subscribes to the practices described below.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL"> 

These practices have been implemented on Moody's "www.moodys.com" Web site, as well as other sites located around the world.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

<b>Moody's Data Collection Practices</b></font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

<u>Browsing a Web Site</u><br>
Generally, a visitor to a Moody's Web site does not have to reveal any individually identifiable information such as name, address or telephone number.  On most sites, Moody's does not require that a visitor provide individually identifiable information nor do we collect any through the use of technology.  Some non-individually identifiable information is collected by Web site servers such as what browser is being used (e.g., Netscape) or the domain name from which a visitor entered the site (e.g., www.your company.com or www.your university.edu).</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

<u>Use of Internet Technology</u><br>
There is technology available today, such as "cookies" or "Java Script", that can be used to provide a Web site visitor with a more customized interaction with the site.  Currently, Moody's is analyzing if the benefits which can be delivered by these technologies will outweigh any potential data protection concerns.  To better serve our customers, Moody's may implement the use of these or other advanced Internet technologies.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
  
<b>Moody's Data Collection and User Choice Options</b></font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

<u>Ordering Products or Services &amp; Customer Registrations</u><br>
Some pages within Moody's sites require provision of individually identifiable information to order a product or to register with Moody's.  When this information is requested, you will know because you will be asked to complete a form and return it to us.  The data requested may include your name, mailing and e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">  

Moody's collects this individually identifiable information to complete business transactions, deliver products and services, administer individual accounts, provide customer support and meet government regulatory requirements such as sales tax collection.  Moody's does not store the information on our Web servers nor does the company sell or otherwise share the information externally.  Moody's does, however, from time to time compile online transaction and registration information for internal analyses such as researching and identifying market segments and needs.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

<b>Confidentiality and Security Safeguards</b></font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

Moody's takes technical, contractual, administrative and physical steps to protect against unauthorized access to and disclosure of individually identifiable information.  If, during their employment, Moody's associates acquire confidential or proprietary information belonging to Moody's or its customers, such information will be handled in strict confidence and may not be disclosed to unauthorized third parties.  Moody's associates are also responsible for the internal security of such information.  On some Moody's sites, technology is used to further secure the information.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

<b>Updates to Moody's Internet Policy</b></font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

The practices outlined above represent current (as of September 1998) Web guidelines and demonstrate Moody's ongoing application of data protection practices.  To keep up with the rapidly evolving Internet environment, Moody's will from time to time review and revise these practices and communicate any updates.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

<b>Questions and Concerns</b></font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">

Questions or concerns regarding Moody's data protections practices should be addressed to Tom Hughes at (212) 553-7116 or <a href="mailto:HughesT@MOODYS.COM">HughesT@MOODYS.COM</a>.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="HELVETICA, ARIAL">
