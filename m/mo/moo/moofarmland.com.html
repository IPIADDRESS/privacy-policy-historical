<p class="P1"><span class="T3">When RockYou Discloses Information</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">RockYou will not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information other than as described in this privacy policy.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf, including credit card processing. We require that our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy and we use reasonable efforts, including confidentiality and security measures, to limit their use of such information.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">We use a third party payment gateway. If you choose to make a purchase within one of our applications, you will be transferred to a third party payment gateway to make the payment. The third party then provides RockYou the name on the account and the amount paid so that we may complete the transaction.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the RockYou Site. RockYou may share personally-identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information with third party-affiliates and business partners for the purpose of offering greater functionality and enhanced services through RockYou or other sites, and for the purpose of communicating these services to you.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to, fraud, potential threats to public safety or the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted by law.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">RockYou also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that RockYou believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our the RockYou Sites, and to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of RockYou, our Users or others.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T3">Your Choices</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the RockYou Sites, in which case RockYou may not be able to provide certain services to you. Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the RockYou Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to our Terms of Use.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">If you have any questions or comments about security on our Web site or this Privacy Policy, you can email us at </span><a href="mailto:info@rockyou.com"><span class="T9">info@rockyou.com</span></a></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T3">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">RockYou allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the RockYou Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the RockYou Sites. These third-parties automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">RockYou does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks RockYou to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the target audience.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T3">Our Commitment To Data Security</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">RockYou uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.
