Such information also may include information related to wire transfers, ACH transactions, or debit cards or checks.</p>
                    <p>Occasionally we conduct optional online user surveys to collect information about our users’ preferences.  Additionally, to improve our service and to provide customer support, we may collect feedback you provide us.  </p>

                    <p>B. Technical Information</p>
                    <p>In addition to the information you provide, we use certain commonly-used Internet technologies to collect information about users of the Site. For instance, we use “cookies” (small pieces of information that are transferred by a website and stored on your computer) to determine how users reached the Site and to track user usage patterns during visits. We use the information we collect from cookies to improve the function, content, appearance, and capability of the Site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but users can turn that feature off by changing browser preferences to refuse cookies, or to prompt the user to accept each cookie.  We also collect information from the user’s web browser every time a page is requested during a visit to the Site.  This may include user operating system, web browser software, screen resolution, and referring website. We may also track user traffic and pathways on the Site. This technical information may be paired with the PII you provide us for our own internal use.  Moolala logs IP addresses for system administration purposes. This information is used to diagnose server problems, monitor traffic patterns, analyze trends, administer the Site, track user patterns, and identify the most popular areas of the Site. IP addresses are not linked to PII and are only used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, except in the case of fraud.</p>
                    <p>We also may use technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our users, including to determine whether users have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails, and to determine whether a user has made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular e-mail. These technical methods may enable us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>
                    <p>We may have ad management partners who help manage our online advertising.  These files enable us to recognize a unique cookie on your browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to the Site.  The information that we would collect and share by this means is anonymous.</p>

                    <p>C. Information That We Collect From Others</p>
                    <p>We may supplement the PII you provide and the technical information we collect with other information that we obtain from third parties. We may also obtain information about individuals who are not yet users of our Site. When we associate information that we obtain from third parties with PII that we have collected under this Privacy Policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we collected ourselves and, except as permitted by this Privacy Policy, the information will not be shared with third parties. </p>
                </div>

                <p class="h1">2. What do we do with the information we collect?</p>
                <p>We use the information gathered on this Site for a variety of purposes, including: (a) to provide you with coupons and deals relevant to your interests, (b) to provide the services and customer support you request, including contacting you via email to provide you with information relating to transactions that you conduct with us; (c) to improve various offerings to you; (d) to resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems; (e) to enforce our agreements; (f) to tell you about targeted marketing, surveys, service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; and (g) to send you an email to notify you about updates to our services, new services, new features, or ways for you to get more out of our service. </p>
                <p>We may use certain data for administrative and analytical purposes such as information systems management, accounting, billing and audits. We also may use personal information to provide you other services, such as sending you an email notification regarding the status of your account or informing you about special promotions, surveys, or other opportunities from Moolala or our marketing partners.</p>
                <p>Both the PII and the technical information gathered on this Site will be combined and stored with the information gathered from other sites owned or run by Moolala, Inc.</p>

                <p class="h1">3. With whom do we share the information we collect?</p>
                <p>The information we collect about you may be shared in the following instances: </p>

                <div class="indent">
                    <p>A. Third-Party Vendors. </p>
                    <p>We employ third-party vendors, service providers, and suppliers to perform various functions on our behalf for our business operations. Such services may include: processing credit card payments, wire transfers, ACH transactions, and similar transactions; collecting debts; analyzing data; developing, hosting and maintaining our Site and databases; advertising, sending and receiving email and other communications; and staffing customer service call centers. These third parties may have access to PII as reasonably necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use PII except for the purpose of providing these services for Moolala. </p>

                    <p>B. Compliance with Law and Protection of Rights. </p>
                    <p>We may disclose your PII to third parties in connection with a court order, subpoena, government investigation, or when otherwise required by law. We may report to law-enforcement authorities conduct we believe may be unlawful, and may release to such authorities PII relating to such suspected unlawful conduct. We may release some or all PII if necessary to protect our rights or property or to protect the safety of our employees or others. We may release PII as part of a dispute resolution process. </p>

                    <p>C. Organizational Changes. </p>
                    <p>If Moolala undergoes a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation, Moolala’s accumulated customer information will be treated as an asset and, like other business assets, subject to transfer to or acquisition by a third party.   The acquiring party will assume the rights and obligations regarding your PII as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p>D. Co-Branding and Joint-Marketing</p>
                    <p>We may enter into co-branding or joint-marketing relationships with third-party websites and companies to provide products, services and content to our users. We may share your PII with certain co-branded third-party service, content, or product providers as required to provide a specific product or service that you request from a co-branded page, co-branded site, or other content provider. However, these third-party partners may not use this PII for any reason other than to provide the service or product that you have explicitly signed up for. </p>

                    <p>E. Anonymous Statistics</p>
                    <p>We also use aggregated information about you and other users (that contains no PII) to provide anonymous statistical information to suppliers, advertisers, affiliates, and other current and potential business partners.  Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of Moolala to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and Moolala may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any manner.</p>

                    <p>F. Merchants</p>
                    <p>Moolala offers a service on the Site through which Moolala and third parties (“Merchants”) may offer vouchers (“Vouchers”) for sale that are redeemable for goods or services from the Merchants.  When you purchase a Voucher through the Site Moolala may provide your PII to the Merchant who sold the Voucher (or from whom the Voucher may be redeemed).</p>

                    <p>G. Certain Moolala Members</p>
                    <p>We will share limited information with Moolala users who have invited you to take advantage of Moolala services (“Members”).  That information will be limited to whether or not you have accepted the invitation.  Additionally, each time you purchase a Voucher for which a Member is eligible for a rewards payment, that Member will be notified of the purchase.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="h1">4. How do you update your personal information or opt out of our mailing list?</p>
                <p>You control the accuracy of your personal data.  You can correct or update information previously submitted to Moolala by emailing privacy@Moolala.com with updated information.  If you wish to review your PII that we have on record or change your privacy preferences you may contact privacy@Moolala.com.  You may also choose not to receive further emails from us by following the URL provided at the end of each email you receive on our behalf and request the deactivation of your information from the Moolala database; provided, however, that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating specifically to Moolala services, or your account, such as service announcements or administrative messages that are considered part of your Moolala account.  </p>
                <p>If you do not exercise your opt-out choices upon registration or initial log-in on the Site, it may take up to 60 days for your opt-out choices to be fully effective. Our systems require time to update, and promotional mailings using personal information shared before your opt-out may already be in process. Thus, you might continue to receive promotional materials based upon the PII you have provided under this Privacy Policy for up to 60 days.</p>

                <p class="h1">5. How do we protect your information?</p>
                <p>We use appropriate security measures to protect your information in a secure, controlled environment (e.g., encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.). We have made investments in server, database, backup, and firewall technologies to protect the security and integrity of your information. When you submit sensitive information to us, we protect the transfer of that information with industry standard encryption technology. The Site is designed so that all financial transactions performed through the Site are conducted in a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) session. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Despite our use of industry standard security technologies, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.  As a result, while we will use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. </p>
                <p>Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your password to anyone. Moolala is not liable for loss of passwords due to user carelessness. If you lose control over your password, you may lose control over your PII on this Site. Therefore, if you believe that your password has been compromised, we recommend that you immediately change your password. </p>

                <p class="h1">6. What Information does this Privacy Policy cover?</p>
                <p>Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy only applies to information collected by us through the Site.  It specifically does not include the following:</p>

                <div class="indent">
                    <p>A. Links to Other Sites</p>
                    <p>The Site may contain links to other websites on the Internet.  Please be aware that we cannot control nor are we responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites.  We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each website to whom you are considering submitting PII.</p>

                    <p>B. Bulletin Boards, Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Blogs</p>
                    <p>The Site may allow registered users to post information on bulletin boards, chat rooms, message boards, and blogs (collectively “Public Areas”).  By posting information to the Public Areas of the Site you are making any posted material public and it therefore is not covered by this Privacy Policy.  Please give careful consideration to this fact before posting any PII in Public Areas of the Site.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="h1">7. How do we protect children’s privacy?</p>
                <p>We are concerned with protecting children who use the Internet.  Moolala complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  The Site does not target and is not intended for children under the age of 13.  We also do not accept registrations or intentionally collect PII from children under the age of 13.  If you believe that your child has submitted personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy or COPPA please notify us in writing and we will immediately remove such information.</p>

                <p class="h1">8. How will you know if we change this Privacy Policy?</p>
                <p>We may change the Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any significant changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending you an email at the last email address that you provided us, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Site. However, it is your responsibility to check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. Any significant changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon the earlier of 30 days after our dispatch of an email notice to you or 30 days after our posting of notice of the changes on the Site.  Please note that, at all times, you are responsible for updating your personal information to provide us your current email address. If the last email address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any other reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the email containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use of personal information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your account with us. </p>

                <p class="h1">9. How do you contact Moolala?</p>
                <p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please email us at privacy@Moolala.com or contact us at: </p>
