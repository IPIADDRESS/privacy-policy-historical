                <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
                <div>
                    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
                    privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United
                    States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from
                    California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information
                    being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more

                    Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nationâ€™s
                    consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and
                    online services must do to protect childrenâ€™s privacy and safety online.
