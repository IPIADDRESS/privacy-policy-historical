	<h3>Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc Privacy Policy</h3>
  Your privacy is extremely important to us so we want you to know  exactly what kind of information we collect about you and how we use it. <br><br>
  We’ve set out all the details below. <br><br>
  Please take the time to read and understand this policy. And  bear in mind that by using our websites and mobile apps, or contacting us by  telephone or providing information to us in our stores or by way of social  media, you agree to its terms.<br><br>
  To help you, we’ve  included some links to other websites. It’s worth remembering though that other  people, not us, control these websites. We’re not responsible for them. <br>
  <br><br>
  <h4><a name="1">What information do we collect and when?</a></h4>
  We only collect information that we know we will genuinely use. <br><br>
  We may collect:<br><br>
<ul class="customList">
  <li><b>All information you choose to submit  to us.</b> You can do that in a  number of different ways:</li>
  <ul class="customList">
    <li>By filling in forms, for  example when you sign up to offers, news or a competition.</li>
    <li>By sending us emails and  text messages (SMS or MMS).</li>
    <li>By adding posts, reviews  and other comments to any of our websites, mobile apps or other community forums.</li>
    <li>By liking or disliking  our offers and promotions;</li>
    <li>By adding offers,  promotions or products to your shopping lists on our Match &amp; More mobile  app;</li>
    <li>By interacting with us on  social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter etc.</li>
    <li>By talking to us in our  stores or over the telephone. For example, when enquiring about a purchase or making  a complaint.</li>
    <li>By registering accounts  on any of our websites or mobile apps including setting up passwords and  preferred user names, contact details, account details, details of friends and relatives,  your preferences and interests.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>(<b>Important:</b> If you  submit details to us of any other person (e.g. a friend) please make sure you  have their permission first.)</p>
<ul class="customList">
  <li><b>‘Sensitive’ information on you.</b> And by ‘sensitive’ we mean information  such as your racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or other beliefs of a  similar nature and your physical condition (e.g. if you’re pregnant). We ask  for a fair amount of this kind of detail in the forms you fill in, and you can  choose whether or not you want to provide it. However, we may also acquire it  though social media or as a result of our analysis of your preferences and  behaviours (see below).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Full details of the purchases  you make</b> on our websites,  through our mobile apps and in our stores or petrol stations. These include the  time, date and location of purchase; the products and fuel you buy from us; any  relevant delivery address; the resulting points and other benefits you  accumulate through our Match &amp; More Card; any vouchers, coupons or other  alternative means of payment you may use, as well as relevant payment cards such  as a credit or debit card.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Any card or other unique  identification numbers</b> we may issue to you from time to time, such as your Match &amp;  More Card number.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Information on what you view,  click on and access</b> by way of our marketing  emails and text messages (SMS or MMS), websites and mobile apps. We also gather  this kind of information when you use our in-store WIFI networks to access the internet.  We may collect the time and geographic location of your device when you do so. For  websites, this information may also include where you came to our site from,  and where you went when you left it. We also track how often you visit and use  our websites and mobile apps. We do this via email and website cookies and  similar tracking technology built into our mobile apps. We make cookie policies  available on each of our websites to give you more detailed information on how  we use them. The cookie policy for this website is set out <a href="../../Privacy-Policy/Cookie-Policy/">here</a>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Technical information about the devices  you use</b> to access our websites  and mobile apps. We also collect this detail when you use our in-store WIFI  networks to access the internet. We specifically save each device’s unique  identifying codes (MAC address or IMEI number) device model, device name,  relevant IP address, operating system and version, web browser and version, and  geographic location.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Your social media content </b>where this is in the public  domain, and any messages you send<strong> </strong>direct  to us via social media.<strong> </strong>This  information can include posts and comments, pictures and video footage on sites  such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. You should always review the terms and  conditions and privacy policies of the social media that you use to make sure  you understand what kind of information relating to you may be out there in the  public domain and how you can stop or limit it from happening. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Basic background information </b>on you from government and other  external sources. We use the Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency to trace car number  plates and owners in the event of drive-offs from our stores or petrol stations.  We also check the electoral roll to make sure any information we have remains  reasonably accurate and, if necessary, to fill in any gaps. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Information from banking, credit card and  credit reference agencies </b>about  your financial status. We also verify any payment card you use when shopping  with us to see if it’s been reported stolen, to check that we’ll be paid for  any transaction, and to reduce the risk of fraud (see below). <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Profile information and insight from organisations </b>that already hold information on you,<strong> </strong>such as credit reference agencies and  ‘customer insight companies’.<strong> </strong>They  give us their views on your household, your status, as well as your possible  preferences and behaviours. <strong></strong><br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This  information includes the likely makeup of your household (e.g. how many  children you may have and their likely average age) and what your household  affairs may be like, the type of car you may drive, your interests (including the  kind of magazines and newspapers you may read, where you might go for your holidays and whether you’re environmentally conscious or not) and where you’re likely to shop. It also includes observations about your likely education and  employment status, the type of job you may have and your likely financial status (including your mobile phone expenditure, what credit, debit and other  cards you may hold, your current account status and any loans, investments and savings you may have). It also places you into one or more defined behavioural and socio-economic groups. </p>
<ul class="customList">
  <li><b>Information collected  independently </b>by online advertising  networks (Google for example) through which we place advertisements. The  information we get from them varies from network to network. It often summarises  the actions of lots of people, and so does not allow us to identify you  individually. It relates to what you view, click on and access through websites  in their network, including the subject matter of the site you started at and  which sites you go to after that. It may also include their analysis of your online  behaviour across the wider internet and a profile of you. If you’re not happy  about this, you should look for ‘settings’ and Do Not Track options in online  advertisements and in the privacy and cookies functions on your devices. You  should also consider changing your settings to block third-party cookies in  particular. Morrisons does not control these cookies and we suggest you check  these third-party websites for more information about the cookies they use and  how you can manage them. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2">How do we use your information?</a></h4>
  We use the information we collect for the following reasons: <br><br>
<ul class="customList">
  <li><b>To provide you with our websites,  mobile apps and in-store WIFI networks</b>, which all require a certain amount of technical information to  work properly. For example, our local store finder is most effective when we  can tell where you are first. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To power our security measures and services </b>so you can safely access  our website and<strong> </strong>mobile apps. It also  lets us do things such as recognise your username and password, as well as reset them if you happen to forget what they are. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To help you shop with us in store and online.</b> For example, we need to  know your credit or debit card details so that we can take payment for the things in your shopping basket and provide you with a receipt.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To help us run competitions and special  offers</b> and make sure you get all  the benefits you’re promised for example, if you have one of our Match &amp;  More Cards. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To get feedback from you</b> about our products, websites, mobile apps, and other services and activities. For example, occasionally we  may invite you to review a product or service you’ve bought or used from us. If  we do, it’s possible that we’ll use independent research and feedback providers  to act on our behalf. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To contact you from time to time </b>regarding things you’ve told us you want to hear about; new products, for example, or special offers, exciting  competitions and sponsored events. If you use our Match &amp; More mobile app, we may use push notifications to highlight when we’ve added new offers and  promotions you may be of interest to you. If you stop shopping with us or using  our services, we may try and tempt you back to us.<br>
    <br>
</li>
  <li><b>To reply to any questions</b>, suggestions, issues or  complaints you have contacted us about.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To respond to any social media posts </b>or other public comments  you might make, whether they are directly to us or about us, our products, websites, mobile apps, services or other activities.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To advertise products or services </b>to you for example on your favourite social media sites (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) or on our mobile apps. Please note that these may be in  the form of a link to someone else’s website.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To tell you about any changes</b> to our products, services, websites and mobile apps. For example, if we withdraw one of our apps for some reason, or  change this privacy policy.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To make a contract with you.</b> But also to enforce a contract if you don’t honour it, including the collection of any debts that we may be owed by you.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To gather statistics </b>about how you and other people  use our website and mobile apps, in-store WIFI networks and what you think of  our advertisements, special offers, news, products and product information,  competitions, sponsored events, social media and other content and<strong> </strong>services. We then analyse all this  data to see if what we do is interesting to people and meets their needs, or if  they should be improved, and if so, what changes would be most beneficial both  for our customers and for us. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To check that you have (or are likely to have) the means to pay us</b> for any products you order from us over the internet or  via one of our mobile apps.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To monitor how people use our websites and mobile apps</b> to see if they are being abused or threatened, for example, by internet  trolls posting inappropriate comments in review areas or by would-be hackers  looking to undermine our security.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To protect you </b>and our business from any other  potentially criminal behaviour, including identity theft and fraud.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To understand you better </b>and in particular, the way you  shop, how and where you travel, your personal circumstances and those of your  family or household, and the things you may like, dislike, or are especially interested  in. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Our aim, quite simply, is to interest and excite you as much as  possible while providing great service and value to you in everything we do. <br>
  By knowing more about you, we’re able to focus on the things we  think are most likely to appeal to you, especially when we send you special offers,  news, information on our products and details of competitions and sponsored  events.<br>
  <br>
  For instance, we can provide you with money-off vouchers and  rewards for the things you actually buy from us, and for the things we think  you might be interested in buying from us in the future. We can also tailor  special offers to the areas where you live or regularly travel to, so when there’s  a promotion at a store near you that we think you may be interested in, we can  let you know.</p>
<ul class="customList">
  <li><b>To help us </b>maintain administrative and  statutory records about our business so we can better understand what we’ve  sold, and how, when, where and at what price, and pay our taxes. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To enable us </b>(and our third-party service  providers) to plan and manage our day-to-day business as effectively as  possible, for example, to predict the possible sales  volumes of a particular product so we can make doubly sure that we have  sufficient stocks to meet the likely demand.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To allow  us to understand our customer base </b>across  all our businesses, both online and in the ‘real world’, from our smallest  store to our biggest supermarket. We do this by merging your details with  information from our other customers and users of our websites, mobile apps and in-store WIFI network. We can then spot  trends and common factors among shoppers, plus we can tailor our business  approach, our marketing communications, our digital and social media, our products  and our services to the things we believe you and other people like you would  be most interested in. This process involves the analysis of many human traits  and is sometimes called ‘market segmentation’ or ‘customer segmentation’. Among  other things, we look at common trends or ‘segments’ based on people’s  geographic location, behaviours, shopping experience, financial standing, the  stuff they do on special occasions and the benefits they look for from products  or services. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To help us conduct focused market  research </b>based on trends and common  factors, so we can further improve the products and services we offer to all  our customers.<strong></strong><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To test new systems and  processes</b> as we roll them out  (but generally only in anonymous form) to make sure they work correctly and meet  the exceptionally high standards we set for ourselves. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To assist us in the development  of new products </b>and services over a  period of time. For example, we may need to gauge whether a new product is  likely to appeal to a large proportion of our customer base. And if not, we’ll  want to know why.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>To see if the money we spend </b>on marketing and advertising  across all media represents good value for us or not. </li>
</ul>
<p>By matching information that’s common to the various sources of  information we have about you, we’re able to build a bigger, richer picture. So  for example, you might enter a competition and provide your email address. You might  then register for an online account with us using the same email address.  Simply linking those two pieces of information together tells us a lot. And we  can achieve the same effect by matching transaction details and technical  information about the electronic devices you use. All of which helps us to understand  you better and provide a more enjoyable experience for you.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="4">Who do we share your information  with? </a></h4>
We can’t run our business or provide many of the services and benefits you receive from us without involving other people and organisations from time to time. When we share your information, we want you to know that we only  do so in accordance with our legal data protection and privacy obligations.<br><br>
Your information may be disclosed to:<br><br>
<ul class="customList">
  <li><b>Companies, brands and businesses  within our group. </b>For example, we’ll share information from our online food business with Morrisons.com and there are  similar arrangements between our other online and store-based businesses. This is  because we hope to have a relationship with you across all our different brands  and businesses, if not now, then sometime in the future. And we want to be able  to provide you with the same value-for-money, high quality experience whenever  and however you shop with us. It’s also the only way we can provide you with  the full benefits of our Match &amp; More Card. Each of our businesses will use your information in line with this policy.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Other people who help us </b>provide our websites, mobile  apps, in-store WIFI networks, stores,  Match &amp; More Card and related services to you. They include information  technology experts who design and host our websites, and payment services  companies that make it easy for you to use your credit or payment cards with us.  Other examples include market research companies, marketing, design and PR  organisations and general service companies such as printers, mailing houses  and form-scanning service providers.<strong></strong><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Our insurers and insurance brokers</b> who provide us with comprehensive  cover against the risks of running a business as big as ours. (They may keep  this information for the purpose of ongoing risk assessment and insurance broking  and underwriting services.) <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Banks and finance companies</b> where we have allowed them to  offer you the possibility of buying our products on credit or with a loan  arranged through our stores or online. (They may keep this information for  their related banking and finance purposes) <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Credit reference agencies</b>, who supply anti-fraud and credit-insight  information to us, <b>central and local  government departments</b> such as the Driver Vehicle Licence Agency (DVLA) and  local authorities who run the UK electoral rolls, <b>banks and finance companies</b> that also provide anti-fraud services,  and <b>customer insight companies</b> (see  above). Where anti-fraud is concerned, the organisations concerned may hold your  information on file for future anti-fraud-prevention purposes.
    <br>
    <br>
  </li><li><b>Third-party companies </b>whose products and services we  sell,<strong> </strong>so they can better understand  the profile of our customers who buy from or are interested in them. However, all  the information we share will be collected and anonymised, so neither you nor  any of your devices can be identified from it.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>With social media companies</b> such as Facebook and Twitter,  to enable us to run targeted promotions for you on their platforms;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Rewards companies </b>which you have signed up to, in  order for you to receive the rewards and benefits they offer when you shop with  us. (They may keep this information)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Any new business partners </b>we may have over time, for  example, in the event of a joint venture, reorganisation, business merger or  sale that affects us.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Our professional advisors</b> including our lawyers and  technology consultants when they need it to give us their professional advice.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>The Police, local authorities,  Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the courts </b>and any other government  authority<strong> </strong>if they ask us to do so (but only if us doing so is lawful).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Other people who make a ‘subject access request’</b>, where we are allowed to do so by law. (See ‘Managing Your Information’ below for what we mean by a  ‘subject access request’.)</li><br>

<p>We may also share the information we collect where we are legally obliged to do so, e.g. to comply with a court order.</p></ul><br>
    <b>Social media, blogs, reviews, etc.</b><br>
  Any social media posts or comments you send to us (on the  Morrisons Facebook page, for instance) will be shared under the terms of the  relevant social media platform (e.g. Facebook or Twitter) on which they’re  written and could be made public. Other people, not us, control these platforms.  We’re not responsible for this kind of sharing. So before you make any remarks  or observations about anything, you should review the terms and conditions and  privacy policies of the social media platforms you use. That way, you’ll  understand how they will use your information, what information relating to you  they will place in the public domain, and how you can stop them from doing so  if you’re unhappy about it.<br>
  <br>
It’s worth remembering too, that any blog, review or other posts  or comments you make about us, our products and services on any of our blogs,  reviews or user community services will be shared with all other members of  that service and the public at large. <br>
  <br>
 You should take extra care to ensure that any comments you make  on these services, and on social media in general are fit to be read by the  public, and are not offensive, insulting or defamatory. At the end of the day,  you are responsible for ensuring that any comments you make comply with any  relevant policy on acceptable use of those services.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Mobile app platforms</b><br>
  Our mobile apps run on third party software  platforms, for example, Apple’s iOS platform which powers Apple’s iPhone and  Google’s Android platform which powers Android-based smartphones.<br>
  If you use any of our mobile apps, your usage of  those apps is also subject to the relevant mobile app platform provider’s terms  and conditions and privacy policy. You should review their terms and conditions  and privacy policy to ensure you understand what information (if any) they will  gather on you, how they will use that information, and what you may be able to  do if you are unhappy about it.<br><br>
<h4><br>
International transfer of your information</h4>
Although we’re based in the UK, we use suppliers from many parts of the world to help ensure you receive the very best in products and services  from us. <br>
  To allow us to run our business on this basis, the information we collect may on occasion be transferred to, stored and used at premises in  other countries including the United States of America. <br>
  <br>
Naturally, we aim to ensure all our suppliers take information security as seriously as we do. <br>
  <br>
Even so, information protection laws can vary from country to country. <br>
  <br>
For instance, the law of the country in which you are resident or domiciled may offer a higher standard of protection than the laws in the UK  and/or the other countries in which we store and use the information we collect. Any transfer of information we make to other countries could result in that  information being available to their government and other authorities in those countries under their laws. <br>
<br>
  <br>
<h4><a name="3">Security of your information</a></h4>
A lot of the information we receive reaches us electronically,  originating from your device and then transmitted by your relevant telecoms network  provider. <br>
  <br>
Where it’s within our control, we put measures in place to  ensure this ‘in flight’ data is as secure as it possibly can be. <br>
  <br>
And once it arrives, you can be sure we take the security of  your information very seriously. <br>
  <br>
We use appropriate procedures and technical security measures  (including strict encryption, anonymisation and archiving techniques) to safeguard  your information across all our computer systems, networks, websites, mobile  apps, offices and stores.  <br>
  <br>
In particular, we follow the internationally recognised security  standard ISO 27001, as well as the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security  standards (PCI-DSS). <br>
<br>
 Plus, we use secure means to communicate with you where  appropriate, such as ‘https’ and other security and encryption protocols.<br>
  <br>
If you have any concerns about the security of your own personal  computers and mobile devices, we suggest you read the advice of Get Safe  Online, which can be accessed <a href="http://www.getsafeonline.org/" target="_blank">here</a><br>
  <br>
<h4><br>
How long do we keep your information? </h4>
To make sure we meet our legal data protection and privacy  obligations, we only hold on to your information for as long as we actually  need them for the purposes we acquired them in the first place (as set out  above). <br>
  <br>
In most cases, this means we will keep your information for as  long as you continue to shop with us or use our services, and for a period time  afterwards if you stop doing so, to see if we can persuade you to come back to  us. <br>
  <br>
After that we will either delete it or anonymise it so that it cannot  be linked back to you. <strong></strong><br>
  <br>
Please note that for our Match &amp; More mobile  app, in order to be able to provide you with the best and most appropriate  offers, promotions, product information and content, we need to build up a  profile of what you like and dislike and what you may have previously been  interested in. As part of this, we retain all data that you choose to delete  from the app (such as a previous shopping list) for a limited time. We use it  to compare your deleted data with the data you currently store so that we can  work out what you are no longer interested in. By doing so we help ensure that  the app content and the offers and promotions we show you are as relevant to  you as possible.<br>
<br>
  <br>
<h4><a name="6">Managing our marketing communications</a></h4>
We provide ways for you  to stop all email and text (SMS or MMS) communications you receive from us –  please see the ‘unsubscribe’ link and ‘STOP’ details we include in each email  and text message respectively. <br>
  <br>
We also check all our telephone  marketing activity against the UK telephone preference services, so if you wish  you can register with that service to stop any such communications from us. <br>
  <br>
You can also contact us  at any time using the details below and let us know exactly what you would like  us to change.<br>
<br>
  <br>
<h4><a name="7">Managing your information</a></h4>
To reduce the chances of an error or misunderstanding, we need  to keep the information we gather about you accurate and up-to-date. <br>
  <br>
But whilst we work very hard to make sure mistakes don’t happen,  we need your help, too. <br>
  <br>
So if you have an online account with us, please ensure that the  information you provide (e.g. any contact information) is correct and that you  review it and update it regularly.<br>
  <br>
If you have reason to believe any of the information we collect  on you may be inaccurate, and you are unable to put it right yourself through  your online accounts with us, please contact us (see below for how to do this).<br>
  <br>
You are perfectly within  your rights to ask us whether we hold information about you and if so, for us  to give you certain details about that information and/or the information  itself. This right is commonly known as a ‘subject access request’. Certain exemptions  and conditions apply to this right, principally that it should be in writing  and that you give us reasonable details about the information you want.<strong> </strong><br>
  <br>
Depending on your  country of residence or domicile, you may have additional or different rights to  those set out above concerning the information we collect from you and your  devices. We will, of course, honour all such legal rights if we are bound by  them. <br>
  <br>
We reserve the right to  charge you a small administration fee  to meet our costs in honouring your legal rights, where permitted by the  relevant law. <br>
  <br>
We also reserve the right  not to comply with any enquiries or requests we receive about the information  we collect, where we may lawfully do so. For example, if we have reason to  believe that a request is malicious, technically impossible, involves  disproportionate effort or could be harmful to others.<br>
  <br>
If you have any worries or complaints about the way we use your  information, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. We’ll do our very  best to set your mind at rest or put things right. And if, for whatever reason,  you feel we’re not meeting the exceptionally high standards we expect of  ourselves, you’re within your rights to take your grievance to the UK  Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Please see the section ‘Where to go if  you want more information about your privacy rights’ for further details.<br>
  <br>
And don’t forget that with modern technology, you have more and  more personal control over what information we and other organisations collect.  For example, you can normally delete cookies and tracking technologies sent to  your web browser. You can also change related settings to restrict them going  forward, such as by using a private browsing mode (although this may affect  your browsing experience on some websites). Plus, you can use the settings  options in your mobile devices to restrict what sort of information websites  and mobile apps are able to access and use about you. Online advertising  networks, social media platforms and search engines (Google etc.) also provide tools  to manage the data they collect about you, and how it is used and shared. We  urge you to look out for these functions and tools and use them to manage your  privacy in a way that suits you best. <br>
<br>
  <br>
<h4><a name="5">Updates to this privacy policy</a></h4>
We review the ways we use your information regularly. And in doing  so, we may change what kind of information we collect, how we store it, who we  share it with and how we act on it.<br>
  <br>
Consequently, we will need to change this privacy policy from time  to time to keep it accurate and up-to-date. <br>
  <br>
Whenever we change this policy, rest assured we will make every  effort to tell you. That way, you can check to see if you’re still happy. And  if, following any changes, you continue to use our websites and mobile apps,  contact us by telephone or otherwise provide information to us (through our  stores or social media, for example) we will assume that you agree to those  changes.<br> 
<br>
  <br>
<h4>Pharmacy &amp; CCTV information</h4>
We have pharmacies in many of our stores, and CCTV is in  operation at all of our stores and petrol stations. <br>
  <br>
Please be aware that all the information you provide us with by  way of any of our in-store pharmacies <strong>is  held separately</strong> from all the other information we collect about you (as set  out above). It is <strong>not</strong> used or shared  in the ways we’ve described above.<br>
  <br>
The same is also true for all the CCTV footage we capture. <br>
  Instead, all in-store, pharmacy-related information we hold  about you is kept and used in strict accordance with National Health Service  information governance requirements. For further details, including our  in-store, pharmacy-specific privacy notice, speak to one of our in-store  pharmacy assistants, who will be happy to help you. <br>
  <br>
Likewise, all CCTV footage is captured purely for your security and  for the prevention and detection of crime. If you’d like to know more, please  see our in-store signage, or contact us using the details provided below. <br>
<br>
  <br>

<h4>Where to go if you want more information about your privacy rights</h4>
The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) regulates data  protection and privacy matters in the UK.

You  can access them <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_the_public" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
  <br>
You can make a complaint to the ICO at any time about the way we  use your information. However, we hope that you would consider raising any  issue or complaint you have with us first. Your satisfaction is extremely  important to us, and we will always do our very best to solve any problems you  may have.<br>
