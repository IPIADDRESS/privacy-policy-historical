            <br>
             The privacy of personal information you provide to us (your personal
            information) is important to us. The following privacy policy
            governs the collection and use of your personal information by
            Mortgage Choice Australia Limited (ACN 009 161 979) its related
            entities, subsidiaries, employees and the broker that will assist
            you (“we”, “us” or “the Group”). This privacy policy
            sets out how we intend to respect your rights to privacy in
            accordance with the National Privacy Principles contained in the
            Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). The National Privacy Principles will apply
            from their introduction on 21 December 2001.<br>
            <strong><br>How we collect personal information.</strong><br>
            <br>

            We may collect personal information from you through our call
            centres and through our brokers when interviewing you or from our
            website in our online application forms and surveys.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>What personal information do we collect?.</strong><br>
            <br>

            We collect personal information about you to enable us to assess
            your suitability and eligibility for obtaining a home or commercial
            loan. The types of personally identifiable information we may
            collect include your name, address, telephone number, occupation and
            financial information.<br>
            <br>

            When we request your personal information, we will endeavour to
            specify which information we require for our purposes and which
            information may be provided at your option. You may choose not to
            supply any optional information requested by us but our ability to
            assist you may be restricted.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>How do we use your personal information?</strong><br>
            <br>

            We use your personal information to assist us in:<br>
            <br>

            1. conducting our business, for example, in determining whether you
            may qualify for a home loan;<br>
            2. completing a transaction to which the provision of that personal
            information relates, for example, in the completion of loan
            application forms;<br>
            3. to communicate information about our products and services to
            you;<br>
            4. for our internal administrative, marketing, planning, product
            development and research requirements.<br>
            <br>
            At any time you may opt out of receiving any communications from us
            (other than as required for the operation of our business). If you
            wish to opt out of receiving communications from us please either
            contact your broker or our Privacy Officer whose contact details are
            set out later in this policy.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Do we disclose your personal information to others?</strong><br>
            <br>

            We do not sell our client lists to third parties. We will not
            disclose personal information about you to any person outside the
            Group except on a confidential basis to our approved panel of
            lenders, and agents that we may use in the ordinary operation of our
            business, such as for data processing, printing or mailing. These
            third parties are strictly prohibited from using your personal
            information for any other purpose. We will only disclose to these
            third parties that information necessary for them to perform their
            services. Otherwise, we do not disclose personal information unless
            we are required to do so by law or regulation.
        

            <br>

            We are a franchise network and your personal information may be
            disclosed between Mortgage Choice and its brokers within the Group
            to facilitate a transaction to which the provision of that personal
            information relates or to enable us to properly conduct our business
            within the Group<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Your access rights to the personal information we hold</strong><br>
            <br>

            At any time, you may ask us to provide you with a list of the
            personal information we hold about you, and copies of that personal
            information. We will endeavour to provide you with the data within
            30 days of receiving your request. We may charge you a small fee to
            cover any administrative costs that we may incur in providing
            personal information to you.<br>
            <br>

            If you believe for any reason that we are holding inaccurate or
            incomplete data about you, you may ask us to correct it. We will
            consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not agree
            that there are grounds for amendment, then we will add a note to the
            personal information stating that you disagree with it.<br>
    
            Financial information becomes out of date very quickly and so we
            will update that information if it is required in any future
            dealings we may have with you.<br>
            <br>

            We will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify your
            personal information when your personal information is no longer
            required for our business functions.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>How do we store your personal information?</strong><br>
            <br>

            from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or exposure. We
            require all staff to maintain the confidentiality of customer
            information. Access to information stored electronically is
            restricted to employees whose job requires access to the
            information. Access to our computer systems is restricted through
            password protection.<br>
