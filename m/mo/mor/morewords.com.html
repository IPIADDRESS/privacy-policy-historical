<p>
I take the privacy of visitors to this website seriously. 
I don't collect any personally identifiable information.

I'll only use that email address to reply to you, and I won't
pass it on to any third 
parties.
</p><p>
I allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect 
certain anonymous information when you visit this web site. 

They may use non-personally identifiable information 
(such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, 
subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) 
during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to 
provide advertisements about goods and services 
likely to be of greater interest to you.</p><p>  
These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon

I use cookies to count the number of pages you've seen, and to record

of those features will work.
</p><p>
I may use server log files, and third-party statistical services,
