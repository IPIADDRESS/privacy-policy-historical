			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><a href="http://www.carsonsi.com">Carson Services, Inc.</a></b> holds the privacy and security of our site visitors in the highest regard. The following information explains what kind of information is gathered on our site and how that information is used.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>What's collected and what's not?</b><br>
					You can visit our site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information. While IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session, the user remains anonymous. Tracking IP addresses gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session is tracked, but the user is anonymous. The user's browser also lets us know the type of computer and operating system being used.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We capture the email addresses of only those who have purchased products from us, and those who sign up for one or more of our mailing lists. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>How is email information used?</b><br>
					Email addresses are used to send you information that you requested or to confirm orders only. </font></p>
			<p><font color="#cc0000" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>We NEVER sell, rent, or loan our email lists to outside firms. Period!</b><br>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>How do I remove my name from mailing lists to which I previously subscribed?</b><br>
					Simply follow the simple removal directions always provided at the bottom of the newsletter you received from us.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Is supplied credit card information retained?</b><br>
					We retain this information for a period of time to allow for the possibility of a credit being posted to your credit card for a product being returned.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>What about phone and fax numbers?</b><br>
					We request a phone and/or fax number on order forms in case we need to contact you about your order. However, this information is entered into our personal customer database only. We NEVER sell, rent, or loan our list of customer fax or phone numbers. Nor any other information about customers.</font></p>
