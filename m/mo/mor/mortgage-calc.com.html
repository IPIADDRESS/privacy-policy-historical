<p class="text">We collect several types of information from and about users of this Site, including the information described below.</p>
<p class="text"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personally Identifiable Information </span><br>
In this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable information means information that identifies a particular individual, such as an individualâs name, postal address, e-mail address, and phone number. Personally identifiable information does not include screen names or user names that you may provide to us or through this Site. The following are certain situations in which we may collect personally identifiable information from you:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li class="text">When you fill out forms or fields on this Site;</li>
<li class="text">When you communicate with us or request information about us, this Site and our services, whether via email or other means;</li>
<li class="text">When you participate in online surveys;</li>
<li class="text">When you participate in any of our marketing initiatives, including, contests, events, or promotions; and</li>
<li class="text">When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">It is also possible that we may collect personally identifiable information about you from sources other than you, such as forums, instant messaging services, blogs, other users of our products and services and our business partners.</p>
<p class="text">If you use any functionality on this Site allowing you to send content to a friend, then please be aware that: (a) we may display your email address to your friend; and (b) we may use information you provide about your friend to facilitate the communication and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="text"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Personally Identifiable Information </span><br>
We may collect demographic information about you such as gender, zip code, and birth date, and information regarding your preferences and usage. This type of information is not, by itself, personally identifiable information. However, if we link such information with personally identifiable information in a manner that identifies a particular individual, then we will treat all such information as personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="text">We may collect non-personally identifiable information about you through a variety of technical methods, including the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li class="text">Collection of Usage Details and IP Address. As you navigate through this Site, we may collect details of your visits to this Site, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, logs, the resources that you access, and information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type. We may use this information for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and business partners.</li>
<li class="text">Collection with Cookies. âCookiesâ are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing a website. We may set and access cookies on your computer to track and store preferential information about you. You consent to our placement of cookies on your computer. Please note that most Internet browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete cookies stored on your computer. If you choose to do so, however, your use of certain aspects of this Site may be restricted.</li>
<li class="text">Collection with Web beacons. âWeb beaconsâ are electronic images, tags or scripts that allow a website to access cookies and help track general usage patterns of visitors to a website. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information, such as cookies, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. We may use Web beacons to compile information regarding use of this Site.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">The information collected through these technical methods, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity. Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally identifiable information. If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.</p>
<p class="text_header">How We Use Your Information</p>

</ul>
<p class="text_header">Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p class="text"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Typical Disclosure</span></p>
<p class="text">We may disclose personally identifiable information:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li class="text">To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive your personally identifiable information as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);</li>
<li class="text">To our third party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and business operations, including for the handling of data processing, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of promotional and transaction materials, and this Siteâs maintenance and security;</li>
<li class="text">To third parties when you (i) engage in certain activities on this Site that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party, and/or (ii) respond to promotional materials from us and you authorize a third party to use your personally identifiable information to, for example, send you additional promotional materials, provide you a product or service, or enter you into a sweepstakes. When we disclose your personally identifiable information to these third parties, your personally identifiable information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personally identifiable information;</li>
<li class="text">As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative agency;</li>
<li class="text">As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering with anotherâs rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or property;</li>
<li class="text">If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency;</li>
<li class="text">To enforce our<a href="http://www.mortgage-calc.com/terms/"> Terms of Use</a>, this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable agreements and policies;</li>
<li class="text">To enforce or protect our rights;</li>
<li class="text">In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below (see <a href="#btransfer">Business Transfers</a> below); and</li>
<li class="text">To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or management with us).</li>
</ul>
<p class="text"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aggregation and De-Personalization</span></p>
<p class="text">We may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). We may use and/or disclose to third parties such aggregate or de-personalized information in any manner and without notice or compensation to you.</p>
<p class="text"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requests for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers</span></p>
<p class="text">Certain portions of this Site may allow you to request a quote, services or information from one or more third parties, such as insurance providers (âRequested Service Providersâ). If you provide your personally identifiable information on the Site and request a quote, services or information from Requested Service Providers (e.g., by clicking âSubmitâ or âget your quotesâ) (a âRequestâ), we may share, loan, rent or sell your personally identifiable information to our affiliates, Requested Service Providers that we match with your Request, your current provider, or to other third parties that may match you with a Requested Service Provider. In addition, the Requested Service Providers and such third may further disclose, share and use any personally identifiable information provided by you in connection with your Request. If you make a Request, you expressly consent to such disclosure and use of your personally identifiable information. <strong> If you do not want your personally identifiable information shared as described above, then you should not submit a Request.</strong></p>
<p class="text"><strong>IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA TELEPHONE, FAX, AND EMAIL. YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST ON THIS SITE, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY. </strong></p>
<p class="text">If you are matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request. Requested Service Providers may need to share your personally identifiable information to conduct such research. As an example, if you request insurance quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance application. Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged for insurance. Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance. In addition, insurance companies may use third parties in connection with the development of a âinsurance scoreâ for you. <strong> If you do not want Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a quote for your Request, then you should not submit a Request.</strong></p>
<p class="text"><strong>Please note that if you submit a Request on this Site and we share your information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of your information in connection with that Request.</strong></p>

Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, the Terms or any other applicable agreement or policy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you use this Site at your own risk</span> and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information will always remain private.

A âBusiness Transferâ means a sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business.

<p class="text_header">Network Advertising</p>
<p class="text">From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumerâs interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumerâs specific interests. This practice is often referred to as âonline behavioral advertising.â For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of this Site and other websites, the location of your Internet service providerâs presence, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and website. Please see the âOnline Behavioral Advertisingâ subsection of<a href="#choicehow"> Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information</a> below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.</p>
