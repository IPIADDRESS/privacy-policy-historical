Your information will not be disclosed in a personally identifiable manner  to such third party advertisers without your consent.&nbsp;</li>
                         
                            <li class="text"><strong>External Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp; There are a number of separate services  offered by affiliates and third parties that are referred to as external  service providers that may be complementary to your use of the Site (e.g.  realtors, mortgage brokers, lenders, financial institutions, credit card  issuers, information aggregators).&nbsp; If  you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external  service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about  you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy  policy.&nbsp; With your consent, some of your  personal information may be provided to the external service provider offering  such services, for your convenience.&nbsp; To  prevent&nbsp; disclosure of your personally  identifiable information to an external service provider, you can decline such  consent or simply not use their services.&nbsp;  You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before  deciding to use their services.</li>

                          <p class="text">In  addition, due to the existing regulatory environment, there is no assurance  that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable  information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this  Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By way of example  (without limiting the foregoing), personal information may have to be disclosed  to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties  may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private  communications.&nbsp; Therefore, although  industry standard practices are used to protect your privacy, it cannot be  promised, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable  information or private communications will always remain private.</p>
                          <p class="text"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are submitting personally identifiable  information pursuant to sweepstakes entry, the right to share, loan, rent  and/or sell the personally identifiable information that you submit with  affiliates and other third parties is hereby reserved.
