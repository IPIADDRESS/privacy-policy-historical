<h2>How we collect your personal data</h2>
<p>We collect data about you through a variety of different methods including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct interactions: You may provide data by filling in forms on our site (or otherwise) or by communicating with us by post, phone, email or otherwise, including when you:
<ul>
<li>order our products or services;</li>
<li>create an account on our site;</li>
<li>subscribe to our service or publications;</li>
<li>request resources or marketing be sent to you;</li>
<li>enter a competition, prize draw, promotion or survey; or</li>
<li>give us feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automated technologies or interactions: As you use our site, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and usage patterns. We collect this data by using cookies, server logs and similar technologies. We may also receive Technical Data about you if you visit other websites that use our cookies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who we share your data with</h2>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other companies in our group who provide services to us.</li>
<li>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.</li>
<li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers.</li>
<li>Government bodies that require us to report processing activities.</li>
<li>Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<h2>How long we retain your data</h2>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>If you leave a comment, contact us, or submit a content, the content and its metadata are retained indefinitely. The administrators can see and edit the information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>
<p>You have rights in relation to your personal data that include the right to request access, correction, erasure, restriction, transfer, to object to processing, to portability of data and (where the lawful ground of processing is consent) to withdraw consent.</p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<h2>Where we send your data</h2>
<p>We share your personal data within our group of companies which involves transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p>Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or</li>
<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or</li>
<li>Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
<h2>Additional information</h2>
<h3>How we protect your data</h3>
<p>We have put in place security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, altered, disclosed, or accessed without authorization. We also allow access to your personal data only to those employees and partners who have a business need to know such data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they must keep it confidential.</p>
<h3>What data breach procedures we have in place</h3>
