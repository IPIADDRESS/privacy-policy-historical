<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your privacy is very 
important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable 
and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of 
information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.</font> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We have created this 
Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This 
Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all end users 
of our Internet services (the "Services")-those who access some of our Services 
but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products 
and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what 
we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have 
concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that you read 
this Privacy Policy carefully.</font> 
</p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> Personal Information 
Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</b></font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction. Our company 
collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the 
various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through 
our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience 
as you use our Products and Services, and generally, do not share this inf,ormation 
with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if 
we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, 
such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special 
cases described below.</font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Registration: Members 
may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our 
Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information 
(such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to 
access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the 
registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing 
purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically 
stated otherwise or in special circumstances. </font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> However, in instances 
where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the 
partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username 
of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for 
the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. 
</font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In this instance, personal 
information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also 
generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members 
provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). 
As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying 
information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.</font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our Company Partners 
and Sponsors: Some products and services may be offered to Visitors, and Members 
in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated 
partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these products and services, 
the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, 
you will be notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may 
decide not to use that particular service or feature. </font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Additionally, our partners 
may have advertisements or co-branded Web Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, 
independent contractor seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share 
non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not 
personal information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded 
products or services offered.</font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Online Shopping: At 
some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive 
materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates. In 
many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, 
address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. </font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you complete an, 
order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, 
you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's 
name, address, and phone number. Our company has no control over the third parties' 
use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please 
exercise care when doing so.</font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you order services 
or products directly from our company we will use the personal information you 
provide only to process that order. We do not share this information with outside 
parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Online Advertisements: 
Our company may display our online advertisements. In those cases we share aggregated 
and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through 
the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with 
these advertisers. </font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Additionally, in some 
instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored 
advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture 
company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement 
tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information 
we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended 
audience. Our company does not share personal information about its Visitors or 
Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.</font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Responses to Email 
Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the return 
email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Our company does 
not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the 
return email address with any third party.</font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Voluntary Customer 
Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. 
We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide 
us with important information that helps us to improve the types of products and 
services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and 
responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by 
a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.</font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We may take the information 
we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or 
aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have to create broader, 
generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, 
education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We 
then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to 
you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally 
identifying information may be shared, with third parties.</font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Special Cases: It is 
our company's policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors 
of Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing 
you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. </font> 
</p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> However, we may disclose 
personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your 
use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason 
if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: 
credit, agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, 
or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child 
Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; 
to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal 
action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms 
Of Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect 
our company and our Members.</font> 
</p><p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Cookies" and How Our 
Company Uses Them. A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your 
hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. Our company may use cookies to collect, 
store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the 
products and services we provide and to manage our affiliate program.</font> 
</p></center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you are a Visitor 
or Member we may use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable 
and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access 
any of your customer information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit other 
Web sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be 
required to accept cookies.</font> <!-- #EndEditable -->
