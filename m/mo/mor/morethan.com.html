<h3>How we use your information</h3>

<p>Please read the following carefully as it contains important information relating to the details you give us. You should show this notice to any other party related to this insurance.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>

<p>MORE TH&gt;N is a trading style of the RSA Group of companies.</p>

<p>You are giving your information to Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance plc, which is a member of the RSA Group of companies (the Group). In this information statement, ‘we’ ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to the Group unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>By submitting any information about you and, where applicable, others within our website at www.morethan.com you and they consent to its use as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>How your information will be used and who we share it with</h3>

<p>Your information comprises of all the details we hold about you and your transactions and includes information obtained from third parties.</p>

<p>If you contact us electronically, we may collect your electronic information identifier, for example your Internet Protocol (IP) address or telephone number supplied by your service provider.</p>

<p>We may use and share your information with other members of the Group to help us and them:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assess financial and insurance risks</li>
	<li>Recover debt</li>
	<li>Prevent and detect crime</li>
	<li>Develop our services, systems and relationships with you</li>
	<li>Understand our customers’ requirements</li>
	<li>Develop and test products and services.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the Group except:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Where we have your permission, or</li>
	<li>Where we are required or permitted to do so by law, or</li>
	<li>To credit reference and fraud prevention agencies and other companies that provide a service to us, our partners or you, or</li>
	<li>Where we may transfer rights and obligations under this agreement.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may transfer your information to other countries on the basis that anyone we pass it to, provides an adequate level of protection. In such cases, the Group will ensure it is kept securely and used only for the purpose for which you provided it. Details of the companies and countries involved can be provided on request.</p>

<p>We would like to keep you informed (by phone, post, email or text) of selected products and services available from us. If you would prefer not to receive this information from us and have not previously advised us of this, please let us know when you contact us.</p>

<p>From time to time we may change the way we use your information. Where we believe you may not reasonably expect such a change we shall write to you. If you do not object, you will consent to that change.</p>

<p>We will not keep your information for longer than is necessary.</p>

<p>For your protection, calls to our service centres may be recorded and monitored.</p>

<h3>Sensitive information</h3>

<p>Some of the information we ask you for may be sensitive personal data, as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998 (such as information about health or criminal convictions). We will not use such sensitive personal data about you or others except for the specific purpose for which you provide it and to carry out the services described in your policy documents. Please ensure that you only provide us with sensitive information about other people with their agreement.</p>

<h3>Keeping safe online</h3>

<p>At MORE TH&gt;N we advise our customers to always close down the browser they have used after accessing our site, or any other, to ensure other users cannot obtain access to their data. This is best practice when using both home and 'public' computers.</p>

<h3>Credit reference agencies (for motor and home customers only)</h3>

<p>To determine premium payment rates at quote and renewal and/or any future invitations, we will make checks on the electoral role and public data through a credit reference agency. These enquiries will be recorded but will not affect your credit rating.</p>

<h3>Fraud prevention agencies</h3>

<p>If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified or suspected, details may be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.</p>

<p>We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities</li>
	<li>Recovering debt</li>
	<li>Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance</li>
	<li>Checking details of job applicants and employees.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please contact the Data Protection Liaison Officer at the address below if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies.</p>

<p>We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.</p>

<h3>Claims history</h3>

<p>Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register (CUE) run by Insurance Database Services Ltd (IDS Ltd) and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register (MIAFTR), run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI).</p>

<p>Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (e.g. accident, fire, theft or malicious damage) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to the registers.</p>

<h3>How to contact us</h3>

<p>On payment of a small fee, you are entitled to receive a copy of the information we hold about you. If you have any questions, or you would like to find out more about this notice you can write to:</p>

<p>Data protection liaison officer,<br>
Customer relations office<br>

<p>You may also email us at <a href="mailto:crt.halifax@uk.rsagroup.com"> crt.halifax@uk.rsagroup.com</a></p>

<h3>Motor insurance database</h3>

<p>Information relating to motor insurance policies will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB). MID and the data stored on it may be used by Insurers, the Police, DVLA/DVANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau or other bodies permitted by law for purposes including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Electronic Vehicle Licensing</li>
	<li>Continuous Insurance Enforcement</li>
	<li>Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and or prosecution of offenders)</li>
	<li>Obtaining information if you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories).</li>
</ul>

<p>Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.</p>

<p>It is vital that the MID holds your current registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized.</p>

<p>You can check that your correct registration number details are shown on the MID at <a target="_self" href="http://www.askmid.com/">http://www.askmid.com</a></p>

<h3>How we protect your information</h3>

<p>We capture your personal information, such as names and addresses, over a secure link using recognised industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology which encrypts the data whilst passing it over the web. This will be indicated on most browsers by a lock in the status bar at the bottom of the screen. Firewalls are used to block unauthorised traffic to the servers and the actual servers are locked in a secure location which can only be accessed by authorised personnel.</p>

<h3>Call charges</h3>

<p>0345 / 0344 / 0343 / 0330 numbers will be charged at your local rate. Other provider's charges, including calls from mobile phones, will vary depending on your network rate</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are small text files placed on your computer and are commonly used on the internet. There are various types of cookies which perform different functions, such as remembering which items you have placed in your shopping basket or analysing your browsing behaviour to enable advertisers to present you with adverts more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

<p>For more information about cookies, visit<a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/"> http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a></p>

<p>The following types of cookies may be used during your visit to our website:</p>

<h3>Strictly necessary cookies</h3>

<p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as obtaining a quote or logging into your account, cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.</p>

<h3>Performance cookies</h3>

<p>These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. They also allow us to record and count the number of visitors to the website, all of which enables us to see how visitors use the website in order to improve the way that our website works.</p>

<p>These cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor, as all information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our website works.</p>

<p>We update our site frequently and sometimes that involves some changes in the cookies we have listed above. We try our best to keep this list up to date but due to various technical constraints we can only update this list every three months.</p>

<h3>Functionality cookies</h3>

<p>These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the policies you buy. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can customise.</p>

<p>They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised. They do not gather any information about you that could be used for advertising or remember where you have been on the internet</p>

<p>We use the following first party cookies for functionality. Some of them may also appear as third party cookies:</p>

<p><strong>Web chat services</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>SmartMaxUser</li>
	<li>SmartMaxSession</li>
	<li>ASPSESSIONIDCASDSDRC</li>

	<li>ASPSESSIONIDSCTDQDTB</li>
	<li>LivePersonID</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, some of our partners may use third party cookies in this category. We update our site frequently and sometimes that involves some changes in the cookies we have listed above. We try our best to keep this list up to date but due to various technical constraints we can only update this list every three months.</p>

<h3>Targeting cookies</h3>

<p>These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are usually placed by advertising networks rather than website operators. They remember that you have visited a website and share this information with other organisations such as advertisers. They do this in order to provide you with targeted adverts more relevant to you and your interests. Quite often they will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation. Although the cookies can track your visits around the web they do not usually know who you are.</p>

<p>Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests. These cookies will usually be third party cookies, although if you are visiting the advertising network's own website, it is technically possible these could be first party cookies. These cookies can be associated with services provided by the third party, but this is not always the case. All information these cookies collect is anonymised, although they contain a unique key that is able to distinguish individual user browsing habits or store a code that can be translated into a set of browsing habits or preferences. Generally speaking the third party’s Privacy Policy on their website will indicate if the cookie is being used as part of an advertising network.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cookies placed by advertising networks to collect browsing habits in order to target relevant adverts to you. The site you are visiting need not actually be serving adverts, but often this will also be the case.</li>
	<li>Cookies placed by advertising networks to complement services used by website operators to increase functionality, for example, commenting on a blog, adding a site to your social network, providing maps or counters of visitors to a site. We do not use any first party cookies for targeting, however some of our partners may use third party cookies in this category.</li>
</ul>
