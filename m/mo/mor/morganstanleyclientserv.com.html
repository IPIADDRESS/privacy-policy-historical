						<p><b>AN IMPORTANT NOTICE CONCERNING OUR U.S. PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>
							We are required by federal law to provide you with a copy of our
							Privacy Policy annually. The following Policy applies to current
							and former individual clients who have or had a brokerage account
							with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Incorporated and those individual
							clients who are also current and former advisory clients of certain
							of Morgan Stanley Investment Management's U.S. investment
							advisers and to current and former individual investors in certain
							U.S. mutual funds advised by Morgan Stanley and its affiliates.</p>
							<p>This Policy is not applicable to partnerships, corporations, trusts
							or other nonindividual clients or account holders, nor is this Policy
							applicable to individuals who are either beneficiaries of a trust for
							which we serve as trustee or participants in an employee benefit plan
							administered or advised by us. This Policy is, however, applicable
							to individuals who select us to be a custodian of securities or assets
							in individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, or accounts
							subject to the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act. Please note that we
							may amend this Policy at any time, and will inform you of any
							changes to this Policy as required by law.</p>

							<p><b>WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY</b><br>
							We appreciate that you have provided us with your personal
							financial information and understand your concerns about
							safeguarding such information. We strive to maintain the privacy
							of such information while we help you achieve your financial
							objectives. This Policy describes what nonpublic personal
							information we collect about you, how we collect it, and when
							we may share it with others. It also discusses the steps you may
							take to limit our sharing of information about you with affiliated
							Morgan Stanley companies ("other Morgan Stanley companies"),
							including but not limited to our global financial services affiliates
							that are part of our integrated securities and investment
							management business, and our credit services affiliates.</p>
							<p>Throughout this Policy, we refer to the nonpublic information that
							personally identifies you or your accounts as "personal information."</p>
							<b>1. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</b><br>
							To serve you better and manage our business, it is important that
							we collect and maintain accurate information about you. We obtain
							this information from applications and other forms you submit to
							us, from your dealings with us, from consumer reporting agencies,
							from our websites and from third parties and other sources.<p></p>
							<p>For example:
							</p><ul>
							<li>We collect information such as your name, address, e-mail address,
							telephone/fax numbers, assets, income and investment objectives
							through applications and other forms you submit to us.</li>
							<li>We may obtain information about account balances, your
							use of account(s) and the types of products and services
							you prefer to receive from us through your dealings and
							transactions with us and other sources.</li>
							<li>We may obtain information about your creditworthiness
							and credit history from consumer reporting agencies.</li>
							<li>We may collect background information from and through
							third-party vendors to verify representations you have
							made and to comply with various regulatory requirements.</li>
							<li>If you interact with us through our public and private
							websites (including ClientServSM and ClientLinkSM), we may
							collect information that you provide directly through online
							communications (such as an e-mail address) and through
							interactions with those websites, including the use of "cookies."
							Please consult the Terms of Use of these sites for more details.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><b>2. WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
							ABOUT YOU?</b><br>
							To provide you with the products and services you request, to serve
							you better, to manage our business and as otherwise required or
							permitted by law, we may disclose personal information we collect
							about you to other Morgan Stanley companies and to nonaffiliated
							third parties.</p>
							<p><b>a. Information we disclose to other Morgan Stanley companies</b><br>
							In order to manage your account(s) effectively, including servicing
							and processing your transactions, to let you know about products
							and services offered by us and other Morgan Stanley companies,
							to manage our business, and as otherwise required or permitted by
							law, we may disclose personal information to other Morgan Stanley
							companies. Offers for products and services from other
							Morgan Stanley companies are developed under conditions
							designed to safeguard your personal information.</p>
							<p><b>b. Information we disclose to third parties</b><br>
							We do not disclose personal information that we collect about
							you to nonaffiliated third parties except to enable them to provide
							marketing services on our behalf, to perform joint marketing
							agreements with other financial institutions, and as otherwise
							required or permitted by law. For example, some instances where
							we may disclose information about you to third parties include:
							for servicing and processing transactions, to offer our own products
							and services, to protect against fraud, for institutional risk control,
							to respond to judicial process or to perform services on our behalf.</p>
							<p>Morgan Stanley recognizes that your relationship with your Financial
							Advisor is important. If your Financial Advisor's affiliation with
							Morgan Stanley ends and he or she joins a nonaffiliated securities
							broker-dealer with which Morgan Stanley has entered into an
							agreement limiting the use of information, Morgan Stanley will
							permit your Financial Advisor to retain certain of your contact
							information, limited to your name, address, e-mail address, phone
							number and account title.</p>

							<p>When we share personal information with a nonaffiliated third
							party, they are required to limit their use of personal information
							to the particular purpose for which it was shared and they are not
							allowed to share personal information with others except to fulfill
							that limited purpose.</p>
							<p><b>3. HOW CAN YOU LIMIT THE SHARING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF
							PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</b><br>
							We maintain physical, electronic and procedural security measures
							to help safeguard the personal information we collect about you.
							We have internal policies governing the proper handling of client
							information. Third parties that provide support or marketing
							services on our behalf may also receive personal information, and
							we require them to adhere to confidentiality standards with respect
							to such information.</p>
							<p><b>4. HOW CAN YOU LIMIT THE SHARING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF
							PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER MORGAN STANLEY
							COMPANIES?</b><br>
							We respect your privacy and offer you choices as to whether we
							share with other Morgan Stanley companies personal information
							that was collected to determine your eligibility for products and
							services you request ("eligibility information"). Please note that,
							even if you direct us not to share eligibility information with
							other Morgan Stanley companies ("opt-out"), we may still share
							personal information, including eligibility information, with
							those companies in circumstances excluded from the opt-out
							under applicable law, such as to process transactions or to service
							your account. We may also share certain other types of personal
							information with other Morgan Stanley companiesâsuch as
							your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and
							account number(s), and information about your transactions
							and experiences with us.</p>
							If you wish to opt-out, you may do so by:
							<ul>
							<li>Calling us toll-free at 800-295-1460<br>
							MondayâFriday between 8:00a.m. and 8:00p.m. (ET)<br>
							SaturdayâSunday between 9:00a.m. and 11:00p.m. (ET)</li>
							<li>Writing to us at the following address:<br>
							Morgan Stanley Privacy Department<br>
							P.O. Box 809002<br>
							Dallas, TX 75380-9951</li>
							</ul>
							<p>If you choose to write to us, your written request should include
							your name, address, telephone number and account number(s)
							to which the opt-out applies and should not be sent with any
							other correspondence. In order to process your request, we require
							that the request be provided by you directly and not through a
							third party. If you have previously notified us about your privacy
							preferences, it is not necessary to do so again unless you decide
							to change your preferences. Your opt-out preference will remain
							in effect with respect to this Policy (as it may be amended) until
							you notify us otherwise in writing. If you have a joint account,
							your direction for us not to share this information with other
							Morgan Stanley companies will be applied to all account holders
							on that account. Please understand that if you opt-out, you and
							any joint account holders may not receive information about
							Morgan Stanley products and services that could help you manage
							your financial resources and achieve your investment objectives.</p>
							<p>If you hold more than one account with Morgan Stanley, you may
							receive multiple privacy policies from us, and would need to follow
							the directions stated in each particular policy for each account you
							have with us.</p>
							<div class="module"><p><b>SPECIAL NOTICE TO RESIDENTS OF VERMONT</b><br>
							<b>The following section supplements our Policy with respect
							to our individual clients who have a Vermont address and
							supersedes anything to the contrary in the above Policy with
							respect to those clients only.</b></p>
							<p>The State of Vermont requires financial institutions to obtain your
							consent prior to sharing personal information that they collect
							about you with affiliated companies and nonaffiliated third parties
							other than in certain limited circumstances. Except as permitted by
							law, we will not share personal information we collect about you
							with nonaffiliated third parties or other Morgan Stanley companies
							unless you provide us with your written consent to share such
							information ("opt-in").</p>
							<p>If you wish to receive offers for investment products and
							services offered by or through other Morgan Stanley companies,
							please notify us in writing at the following address:<br>
							Morgan Stanley Privacy Department/Vermont<br>
							P.O. Box 809002, Dallas, TX 75380-9951</p>
							<p>Your authorization should include your name, address,
							telephone number and account number(s) to which the opt-in
							applies and should not be sent with any other correspondence.
							In order to process your authorization, we require that the
							authorization be provided by you directly and not through
							a third party.</p></div>
