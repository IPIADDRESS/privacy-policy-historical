You may also give us your personal information when you contact customer services, engage with our social media channels, enter competitions, respond to surveys or provide feedback or product reviews on our website. This will include your name, contact details, date of birth and usernames, and your marketing preferences. </p><p> </p><p>We may also collect, store and use "special categories" of more sensitive personal information such as your racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature and your physical condition (e.g. if you're pregnant, and join our baby club).

Where it's within our control, we put measures in place to ensure this 'in flight' data is as secure as it possibly can be. Once it arrives at Morrisons, you can be sure we take the security of your information very seriously.  </p><p>  </p><p>We use appropriate procedures and technical security measures (including strict encryption, anonymisation and archiving techniques) to safeguard your information across all our computer systems, networks, websites, mobile apps, offices and stores.  </p><p>  </p><p>In particular, we follow internationally recognised security standards including the Payment Card Industry's Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS).  </p></dd><dt class="faq__question"> <h3>How Long Do We Keep Your Information For?</h3>  </dt><dd class="faq__answer"> <p>  </p><p>To make sure we meet our data protection and privacy obligations, we only hold on to your information for as long as we actually need it for the purposes we acquired it for in the first place which includes providing you with the services you have requested, meeting our legal and regulatory obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements.  </p><p>In most cases, this means we will keep your information for as long as you continue to shop with us or use our services, and for a period of time afterwards for tax purposes and just in case you begin shopping with us again.  </p><p>After that we will either delete it or anonymise it so that it cannot be linked back to you.  </p><p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information. </p><p>  </p></dd><dt class="faq__question"> <h3>Rights of access, correction, erasure, and restriction</h3>  </dt><dd class="faq__answer"> <p>  </p><h3>Informing us of changes</h3> <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes by keeping your details up to date on your More Card and online shopping accounts.  </p><h3>Your rights in connection with your personal information</h3> <p>Under certain circumstances, you have the right to:  </p><p><strong>Request access</strong> </p><p>To your personal information (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. </p><p>  </p><p>You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. </p><p>  </p><p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. </p><p>  </p><p>We will respond to all requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month to provide your personal data if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>Request correction</strong> </p><p>Of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected. We may need to verify the accuracy of any new data you provide to us. </p><p><strong>Request erasure</strong> </p><p>Of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. We may not always be able to comply with your erasure request for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.  </p><p><strong>Object to processing</strong> </p><p>Of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest and you want to object to processing on this ground. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which means we can continue to process your personal information. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes and if your personal information is automatically processed or profiled. You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time through our preference centre, or by contacting us directly. </p><p><strong>Request the restriction of processing </strong> </p><p>Of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data.  </p><p><strong>Request the transfer </strong> </p><p>Of your personal information to another party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.  </p><p><strong>Right to withdraw consent at any time </strong> </p><p>Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.  </p></dd><dt class="faq__question"> <h3>Data Protection Officer</h3>  </dt><dd class="faq__answer"> <p>  </p><p>The Morrisons Data Protection Officer (DPO) oversees compliance with this privacy notice.
