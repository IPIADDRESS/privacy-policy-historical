          <b>SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY</b> 
        </p><p>This policy applies to your use of all of the sites and services owned 
          or operated by Ideas Squared, Inc., and affiliated companies (collectively 
          "Mom Central" or "we," "us," or "our"), including momcentral.com, parentcentral.com, 
          dadcentral.com, mrmomcentral.com and any other site that we may own 
          or operate in the future (collectively, the "Mom Central Sites"). Unless 
          we say otherwise, all references to the Mom Central in this policy include 
          all such sites. This policy does not apply to your use of unaffiliated 
          sites to which any of the Mom Central only links. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION</b> 
        </p><p>Mom Central may request Personal Identification Information from you 
          in connection with your use of, or participation in, any features of 
          our web site, www.momcentral.com, or any of our affiliate sites including 
          www.dadcentral.com, www.parentcentral.com, and www.mrmomcentral.com, 
          including but not limited to registrations, content submissions, chats, 
          newgroups, forums, bulletin boards, postings, surveys, focus groups, 
          discussion groups, give-aways, contests, sweepstakes, requests for information, 
          personal data shared or stored on the site, your requests for free products 
          or services or additional information, and in connection with other 
          activities, services, or resources that we make available on our site. 
        </p><p>Your use of momcentral.com is a consent to the foregoing use of your 
          Personal Identification Information by Mom Central. Mom Central also 
          may share your Personal Identification Information with select companies 
          and organizations for their own marketing and promotional use. While 
          Mom Central seeks to share Personal Identification Information with 
          companies that follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any 
          responsibility for the actions and policies of such third parties. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION </b> 
        </p><p>Many of the ways in which you interact with momcentral.com allows us 
          to learn more about you. We collect and store statistics and other information 
          about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) 
          basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page 
          to learn which features are the most popular. In those instances where 
          we do collect Personal Identification Information, you have the option 
          of choosing to reveal it to us or to one of the vendors in our Network. 
          In the event of a complaint, we may also receive Personal Identification 
          Information about you from other parties in our Network or from other 
          users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you 
          in relation to that complaint. 
        </p><p>Momcentral.com may request Personal Identification Information from 
          you in connection with your use of, or participation in, our contests, 
          sweepstakes, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content 
          submissions, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for 
          suggestions, visitors' requests for free products or services or additional 
          information, and in connection with other activities, services or resources 
          we make available on any of our sites. In all of these cases, we will 
          collect personal identification information from you only if you voluntarily 
          submit such information to us. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION </b> 
        </p><p>As a general practice, we do not sell your Personal Identification 
          Information to third parties. For example, we do not sell your email 
          addresses or your name and personal demographic information to mass 
          marketers. However, on particular pages where we ask for your Personal 
          Identification Information, we may explicitly tell you that the data 
          we are collecting on that page will be shared with third parties, in 
          which case those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary 
          in this policy. For example, before you submit answers to questions 
          we ask in an advertiser-sponsored promotion, we will tell you that your 
          answers will be shared with that advertiser. Similarly, if you tell 
          us on our registration page that you want information from related sites 
          or organizations, we will, using our discretion, make that information 
          available to our corporate strategic partners. 
        </p><p>We use your information on an aggregated basis to do such things as 
          operate our site, enhance our site, and sell and deliver advertising. 
          We also use this data, both aggregated and personally identifiable, 
          to enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing 
          messages that we believe will be of interest to you. We disclose aggregated 
          information about our site to third parties. 
        </p><p>If you do provide us with Personal Information, we may use it to conduct 
          the activities described above and for internal marketing and promotional 
          purposes. On occasion, for example, we may send you e-mails to introduce 
          a product or service that we think might be of interest to the users 
          of our sites. If you do not want to receive our e-mails, or do not want 
          us to use your personal information for any of our internal or other 
          purposes, we will give you an opportunity to "opt-out" when our request 
          for your personal information is made. You may "opt-out" at any time, 
          even after you have provided personal information, by following the 
          procedures set forth below at the end of this Privacy Policy. As a user 
          of our site, you must recognize, however, that under certain circumstances, 
          if you choose to "opt-out" you may not be eligible for certain benefits 
          for which a name, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal 
          identification information is needed. 
        </p><p>In some situations, we share your Personal Identification Information 
          with third parties who provide services to our Network in order to enhance 
          the functionality available to you as part of the Network, and to provide 
          you with new products and services such as email and member pages. 
        </p><p>Note that some online activities you choose to do necessarily lead 
          to disclosure of your Personal Identification Information to third parties, 
          such as when you include your name and email address in a postcard or 
          when you order merchandise. In these cases, again, your choice to disclose 
          Personal Identification Information is voluntary. 
        </p><p>Momcentral.com reserves the right to offer you third party services 
          and products based on the preferences that you identify during the registration 
          process and based on your subsequent preferences; such offers may be 
          provided to you by momcentral.com. 
        </p><p>Momcentral.com reserves the right to terminate your momcentral.com 
          e-mail account if momcentral.com learns that you have provided momcentral.com 
          with false or misleading registration information. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>EXCEPTION TO PERMISSIBLE INFORMATION POLICY </b> 
        </p><p>We have two exceptions to these policies: We will release specific 
          information about you or your account to comply with any valid legal 
          process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order. 
          We will also release specific information in special cases, such as 
          when there is a physical threat to you or others. Please note that if 
          you give out personal information online -- for example, through a bulletin 
          board or chat room -- that information can be collected and used by 
          third parties. Although we strive to protect our users' privacy, we 
          cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. 
          You disclose such information at your own risk. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>REGISTRATION AND PASSWORD </b> 
        </p><p>Your Mom Central Account may become password protected so that only

          We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Mom Central 
          and Ideas Squared, Inc. will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited

          <br>
          <br>

          <b>OPTING OUT</b>

          do not want us to use your personal information for any of our internal 
          purposes or other purposes, or do not want this information to be shared 
          with third parties, you may "opt out" by emailing us such a request

          <br>
          <br>
          <b>NON-PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION AND THE USE OF COOKIE TECHNOLOGY 
          </b> 
        </p><p>We may collect non-personal identification information through the 
          use of "cookie" technology and/or IP address tracking. Non-personal 
          identification information might include the browser you use, the type 
          of computer, the operating systems, the Internet service providers and 
          other similar information. Our system may also automatically gather 
          information about the areas you visit on our sites and about the links 
          you may select from within our site to other areas of the World Wide 
          Web or elsewhere online. 
        </p><p>We use such information in the aggregate to understand how our users 
          as a group use the services and resources provided on our sites. This 
          way we know which areas of our sites are favorites of our users, which 
          areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used so that 
          we may continually improve our sites. We may share this aggregate statistical 
          information with our partners, suppliers and other third parties, but 
          in no event will we share any individual names, navigational or other 
          personal information. Some of our advertisers may display ads on our 
          sites which solicit or contain technology to collect information about 
          our users for the advertisers, but we will not permit such advertisers 
          to collect any personal information from our users within our sites 
          Most browsers are set to accept cookies. You can set yours to refuse 
          cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, 
          please note that some parts of the Mom Central Sites, such as shopping, 
          contest, and game areas, may not function properly. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>SECURITY POLICY</b> 
        </p><p>The importance of security for all Personal Identification Information 
          associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great 
          care in providing secure transmission of your information from your 
          PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet 
          can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to

          affiliate sites cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information 
          you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you 
          do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our 
          best effort to ensure its security on our systems. If credit card information 
          is transmitted, we will use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) 
          encryption. 
        </p><p>Remember to sign out of your Mom Central Account and close your browser 
          window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others 
          cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer 
          is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else 
          or are using a computer in a public place. <br>
          <br>
          <br>

          whenever you're surfing the Web. Some services within Mom Central, such 
          as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message 
          poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and 
          only use those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing.
