<p>Momjunction.com is an online  community that connects networks of moms. Momjunction knows that you care  how information about you is used and shared, and appreciates your expectation that we will use and share your information carefully and sensibly. By using the Momjunction.com website (the “Website”),  by registering as a member (a “Member”) of the Momjunction.com service (the  “Service”), or by otherwise interacting with Momjunction.com, you agree to  accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>1. Types of Information Collected  by Momjunction.com Momjunction.com collects two types of information from  its Members: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally  Identifiable Information. </p>
<p>Personally Identifiable  Information. “Personally Identifiable Information” is information that  identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you. Personally  Identifiable Information may include your name, address, email address,  telephone number, birth date, and billing and credit card information.  Momjunction.com requests Personally Identifiable Information from you when you  register as a Member of the Service. Momjunction.com collects Personally Identifiable  Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to  Momjunction.com. </p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable  Information. When you become a Member of the Service, Momjunction.com collects  information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as  demographic information (like personal interests, age, education, profession or  gender) ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information"). Non-Personally  Identifiable Information may also include IP addresses, browser types, domain  names, and other anonymous statistical data involving your use of the Website  and/or Service. </p>
<p>2. Information Posted by You in  Groups In addition to the types of information Momjunction.com collects from  its members, Momjunction.com allows you to communicate with other Members and  post information in Momjunction.com’s groups using the journal, calendar,  scrapbook, trading post, and other similar features. Information that you post  in any group will be accessible to Members who have been invited to that group.  Members of a group decide who to invite to join the group. Therefore, groups  may include people you do not know. While Momjunction.com attempts to limit  access to groups to those who have been invited, Momjunction.com does not  control who gets invited to a group, and it is possible for uninvited people to  obtain access to a group. Momjunction.com also includes a “rippling” feature  which allows you to share information with Members of your groups, which then  may be “rippled” to Members outside of your groups. In addition,  Momjunction.com includes a "public profile" feature which allows you  to choose to share information about yourself (including your first and last  name) with others. THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY INFORMATION  (INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION) YOU POST TO GROUPS OR MAKE  AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROFILE FEATURE. ALL SUCH INFORMATION IS PUBLIC  INFORMATION AND MAY BE SEEN OR COLLECTED BY ANYONE, INCLUDING THIRD PARTIES NOT  AFFILIATED WITH MOMJUNCTION.COM. Think carefully before disclosing any  information in any group through Momjunction.com. Whenever you disclose  Personally Identifiable Information through groups, that information can be  collected and used by others. If you post Personally Identifiable Information in  groups, you may receive unsolicited communications from third parties who have  seen the information you posted. </p>
<p>3. Momjunction.com’s Use of  Information It Collects Momjunction.com’s Use of Your Personally Identifiable  Information. Momjunction.com may use your Personally Identifiable Information  to send you updates, newsletters, or notifications related to the Website  and/or Service. With the exception of the foregoing uses, your Personally  Identifiable Information will not be shared or displayed by Momjunction.com to  other Members. Members within a group may communicate with each other through  the Service, without disclosing their email addresses. If you make your email  address or any other Personally Identifiable Information part of your public  profile, or post it in any group, that information will be publicly available,  and Momjunction.com will not be able to control how it is used. To facilitate  searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the Service, Momjunction.com  allows Members to search for other Members using name, email address, postal  code, and Momjunction.com member user name. </p>
<p>Momjunction.com may aggregate  your Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable  Information of other Members, and disclose such information in a non-personally  identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and  promotional purposes. In these situations, Momjunction.com will not disclose to  these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. </p>
<p>Momjunction.com, or  Momjunction.com’s business partners, may sponsor promotions, sweepstakes or  contests on Momjunction.com. If you participate in these events, you may be  asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information or to answer questions  that seek your personal information. Momjunction.com may transfer your  Personally Identifiable Information to its business partners in conjunction  with such events. Momjunction.com will try to make it clear at the point of  collection whether Momjunction.com or one of its business partners is  collecting the Personally Identifiable Information, and whose privacy policy  will apply. </p>
<p>Momjunction.com may transfer your  Personally Identifiable Information to third parties such as Momjunction.com’s  business partners and advertisers if you request information from those third  parties. </p>
<p>Unless you give Momjunction.com  permission to do so, Momjunction.com will not sell, share, license, trade or  rent your Personally Identifiable Information other than as specified in this  Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>Momjunction.com’s Use of Your  Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Momjunction.com uses your  Non-Personally Identifiable Information to help understand who uses the Website  and the Service, and to improve and market the Website and the Service. Your  Non-Personally Identifiable Information may be shared with third parties to  provide more relevant services and advertisements to you. </p>
<p>Invite a Friend Feature. If you  provide Momjunction.com with a friend’s email address through the Invite a Friend  Feature, Momjunction.com will automatically send your friend an email inviting  him or her to join the Service. Momjunction.com stores this email address for  the purpose of sending the invitation and adding the friend to your group’s  address book. Momjunction.com will not sell the email address or use it to send  any other communication other than the invitation. </p>
<p>Permitted Disclosures. Except as  otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Momjunction.com will not disclose  your Personally Identifiable Information to any third party unless  Momjunction.com believes that disclosure is necessary or advisable: (1) in  order to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search  warrant or other legal process received by Momjunction.com, whether or not a  response is required by applicable law; (2) in order to enforce  Momjunction.com’s Terms of Use or to protect Momjunction.com’s rights; or (3)  in order to protect the safety of members of the public or Members of the  Service. Momjunction.com reserves the right to transfer your information,  including Personally Identifiable Information, to a third party in the event of  a sale, merger or other transfer of all or any portion of the assets of  Momjunction.com. In such a case, your information will be subject to such third  party’s privacy policy. </p>
<p>4. Opt-Out If you no longer wish  to receive notification emails or Momjunction.com newsletters, you may opt out  of receiving such communications by logging into your account and changing your  settings in the “Account Information” section. All notification emails and  Momjunction.com newsletters also include instructions for opting-out of those  communications in the future. </p>
<p>5. Use of Cookies Momjunction.com  stores a cookie on your computer if you have cookies enabled. A cookie is a  text file that a web site can send to your browser and store on your computer.  A cookie does not contain Personally Identifiable Information about you unless  you knowingly provide it. A cookie can note that your browser was used to visit  certain sites, pages, or advertisements on a certain date. </p>
<p>Momjunction.com uses cookies to  enhance navigation and the functionality of the Website and Service, to  securely verify your identity, and to personalize aspects of your experience  with the Website and Service. For example, Momjunction.com uses a cookie to  identify you when you enter the account registration portion of the Website so  that Momjunction.com is able to provide you with personalized content.  Momjunction.com also uses a cookie to maintain session information for you when  you are logged-in, in order to prevent the need for re-entry of login  information when browsing outside of the Website. </p>
<p>You do not need to accept cookies  in order to access and use the Website or Service. However, if you do not  accept cookies, your experience with the Website and/or Service may be  adversely affected. For example, you may not be able to maintain your login, or  you may be unable to submit information to Momjunction.com. You can erase  cookies that are already on your computer. For more information on working with  cookies, consult the User Manual, FAQ, or Help function of your specific  browser and operating system software. </p>
<p>Advertisers and other third  parties may also use their own cookies or action tags when you click on their  advertisement or link to their website or service, on or from the Website. This  Privacy Policy does not govern the use of your information by such third-party  websites or providers of third-party advertising. </p>
<p>6. Security of Your Information  Momjunction.com takes reasonable precautions to protect the privacy of your  information that is stored within Momjunction.com’s database, and restricts  access to your information to Momjunction.com employees who need access in  order to perform their job functions. Momjunction.com maintains physical,  electronic, and procedural safeguards consistent with industry standards to  protect your Personally Identifiable Information. Momjunction.com protects your  Personally Identifiable Information by placing it on secure portions of the  Website, using firewalls and other security technology to protect  Momjunction.com’s network and systems from external attacks, and requiring you  to enter a unique user name and password to access your account information online. </p>
<p>You can help to ensure your  security by taking a few simple precautions. To protect against unauthorized  access to your Momjunction.com account and password, be sure to sign off from  Momjunction.com when you finish using the Service. Do not disclose your  password to any third party. Remember that you are responsible for all actions  taken with your account or password. If you lose control of your account or  password, you may lose control over your Personally Identifiable Information  and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. If you  believe your account or password has been compromised for any reason, you  should immediately change your password by logging into your account and  accessing the “Change Password” feature. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding Momjunction.com’s  efforts to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from loss, misuse  or alteration by third parties, there is always risk involved in transmitting  information over the Internet. As with all Internet-based services, there is  risk that others could find a way to thwart Momjunction.com’s security systems.  As a result, while Momjunction.com strives to protect your information,  Momjunction.com cannot ensure or warrant the security or privacy of any  information you transmit to Momjunction.com, and you do so at your own risk. </p>
<p>7. Links to Third Party Web Sites  The Website contains links to other web sites. Momjunction.com has no control  over and is not responsible for the privacy policies or information gathering  practices of these other web sites. We recommend that you review the privacy  policies of every online service you use before submitting any information and  direct any concerns to the web site administrator of that web site. </p>
<p>8. Reviewing and Changing Your  Personally Identifiable Information You may modify or remove any of the  Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to Momjunction.com  through your registration at any time by logging into your account and  accessing the “Edit Profile” feature. When you update your information,  Momjunction.com may keep a copy of the prior version for its records. </p>
<p>Upon your request,  Momjunction.com will deactivate your account and remove your Personally  Identifiable Information from Momjunction.com’s active databases. To make this  request, please send an email <a href="mailto:support@momjunctioncorp.com">support@momjunctioncorp.com</a>. It is not  technologically possible for Momjunction.com to remove each and every record of  Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided to Momjunction.com.  Momjunction’s need to back-up its systems to protect information from  inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information  may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for  Momjunction.com to locate. After receiving your request, Momjunction.com will  take prompt action to update, correct, change, or delete, as appropriate, all  Personally Identifiable Information stored in databases actively used by  Momjunction.com. Information posted by you to any portion of the Website will  not be deleted by Momjunction.com. </p>
<p>9. Children Momjunction.com does  not knowingly solicit information from or market the Website or Service to  children. Children are not eligible to register as Members of the Service and  Momjunction.com asks that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any  information to Momjunction.com. </p>
<p>10. Changes to Privacy Policy  Momjunction.com may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Momjunction.com will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on the Website for  you to review and accept upon logging into your account. </p>
