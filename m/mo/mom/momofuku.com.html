<p><strong>UPDATED: February 7, 2014</strong> This Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time. We will post changes to this Website, and we reserve the right to make changes without prior individual notice. Such changes are effective upon posting.

<p><b><a id="california">California Privacy Rights</a></b><br> Under California law, California residents who have provided personally identifiable information to a company may have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company had disclosed such information for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, along with a list of the categories of Personal Information that had been so disclosed. However, Momofuku’s policy, as disclosed on this Website, does not currently permit Momofuku to share the Personal Information collected at this Website about you with non-affiliated third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Moreover, even if Momofuku’s policy permitted the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes, because Momofuku provides you with an opportunity to opt out of such disclosure, Momofuku does not have to provide you with such lists. If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an email to or contact us via postal mail at:<br><br>

From time to time, we may hire third parties to assist us with certain functions and services, such as our reservation system, data processing, computer software and website maintenance and development, transaction processing, promotional and marketing services, customer service, professional, legal or accounting services, business and sales analysis. Momofuku may share your Personal Information, without restriction (and regardless of whether you have chosen to limit our sharing of your Personal Information as collected on the Website), with such companies that we hire to perform services for us. In such situations, Momofuku requires that these companies agree to maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information and to comply with the safeguards described in this Privacy Policy. These companies have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. Furthermore, in compliance with privacy laws, we also provide our opt-out lists to non-affiliated third party companies so that they can be suppressed from the communications those companies send on Momofuku’s behalf.</p>
<p><b>If Momofuku Changes Ownership</b><br>
We may also share your Personal Information as required to allow for a change in ownership of MomoIP LLC and/or any of Momofuku’s affiliated entities, and/or of any business(es) to which the Website relates, and the related transfer of user information to the new owner.  In the event of any such change of ownership, your Personal Information will continue to be protected by this Privacy Policy unless and until you are notified of a change.</p>
<p><b>Lawful Access, Legal Action, and Investigations</b><br>
Your Personal Information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties as either permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations.  Your Personal Information may be transmitted through and stored on servers outside your home country, and may be accessed by authorities in those jurisdictions. We may disclose Personal Information if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations involving the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or otherwise in accordance with applicable law.  For example, Momofuku may disclose your Personal Information to comply with investigations by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies in the United States of America, Canada or elsewhere, or to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud.  Furthermore, Momofuku may disclose your Personal Information if it has a reasonable good faith basis to believe that it is required to do so by law, compelled by court order or legal process, or is reasonably necessary and/or appropriate to: (i) protect the rights, property and/or safety of Momofuku or any other person or entity; or (ii) prevent or take action concerning any alleged: (a) illegal activity or (b) breach of the Terms and Conditions of Use or Privacy Policy of this Website. </p>
