<h5>At Mom Blog Network, we are committed to maintaining your privacy and trust. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use, and share information about you, including on our website, and/or through your membership in Mom Blog Network. We hope this information increases your confidence in Mom Blog Network and enhances your experience on our website. Please see our separate <a href="http://www.Mom Blog Network.com/legal">Terms of Service</a> which governs the use of the web site and services located at www.Mom Blog Network.com (the "Site").</h5>
<h3>I. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</h3>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, when we use the term "personally identifiable information", we mean any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or email address. When we refer to "aggregate information", we mean information that does not allow us to identify a specific individual but describes a general category of visitors to the Site or particular attributes of such visitors, such as demographic information, usage of the Site and other anonymous information.</p>
<h4>Personally Identifiable Information that We Collect.</h4>
<p>You do not have to be a Mom Blog Network Member to visit our Site and access some of our content. However, as a non-Member visitor, you may not have access to some of the most popular features that Mom Blog Network offers. For example, only Members can leave comments, post on our message boards, blogs, and participate in other online activities. If you are not currently a Mom Blog Network Member, please <a href="/user/register">click here</a> to register and become eligible for all of Mom Blog Network's features.</p>
<p>If you choose to become a Mom Blog Network Member, we will ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address and email address. We will also ask you to provide certain information about yourself and your family. This is a standard process to enhance the safety and maintain the integrity of the Site for all our members.</p>
<p>Non-Member visitors to the Site can register to receive Mom Blog Network newsletters by giving us your name, email address and giving your consent to receive the newsletters. However, you are not considered a full Mom Blog Network Member with all the privileges of membership until you complete the registration form and provide us with additional required Member information.</p>
<h4>Aggregate Information that We Collect.</h4>
<p>We may also collect certain aggregate information automatically when you visit our Site such as the browser you are using (i.e. Internet Explore 6.0, Mozilla Firefox 1.5, etc.), the internet address from which you linked to our Site, the operating system of your computer (i.e., Microsoft Windows), the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Site and usage and browsing habits. We use this information to administer and improve your experience on our Site, to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
<p>To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Site uses data "cookies." These cookies are small data files stored on your computer which identify you as a previous visitor to the Site and help us to personalize your experience when you arrive. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You can instruct your browser not to accept cookies. However, if you disable this function, you will not be able to use some of the features on our Site.</p>
<p>Our Web pages and our e-mail newsletters contain "web beacons." Web beacons allow us to count users that have visited a web page or opened an email that contains a web beacon and collect other types of aggregate information. Using this information, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Site. This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Site are the most interesting and what kind of offers our Members like to see. Some of the web beacons that are in place on our Site are used only by Mom Blog Network, and other web beacons are from our vendors and advertisers who use this data to assist us in analyzing how our Members use the Site. In addition, we have agreements with various affiliate networks that promote Mom Blog Network on their affiliate websites. These affiliate advertisers may use web beacons in their advertisements to track users who click through from the affiliate website to the Site.</p>
<h3>II. HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h3>
<p>At Mom Blog Network, everything we do, including how we handle your personally identifiable information, is designed to show how much we value moms. Your information assists us in understanding the kinds of benefits and services that may suit your needs and interests. Other than as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share personally identifiable information collected from you in connection with the Site with any third parties outside unless you authorize us to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Mom Blog Network E-Newsletters, Offers and Other Communications.</strong> After you register with Mom Blog Network, you may receive communications from us including our e-newsletters, as well as updates and communications about Mom Blog Network. We may ask you which newsletters you wish to receive. You may change your newsletter preferences (i) at any time by simply updating your account, which you can do by clicking on the "My Account" button posted throughout the Site, or (ii) by opting-out of receiving future emails as described at the bottom of each communication from Mom Blog Network.</p>
<p><strong>Forums, Polls and Member-Provided Content.</strong> As a Mom Blog Network Member, you can participate in various online forums, such as message boards, blogs,  ratings, surveys and polls.  All content that you submit to the Site is governed by our <a href="/legal">TOS</a>. Please be aware that by using any of these features, your personally identifiable information will be accessible to Members and non-Members, and Mom Blog Network has no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Mom Blog Network Members have the opportunity to connect with other Members who they might not otherwise meet. When you join Mom Blog Network, you will be asked to provide certain personal information, including, if you wish, a photograph of yourself. You can set the privacy settings to control which data in your profile will be displayed to other moms in Mom Blog Network. Keep in mind that certain basic profile information cannot be hidden and will be available to any other Members in Mom Blog Network once you join the network. If you decide that you no longer want to participate in Mom Blog Network, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>, and your name and profile will be removed from Mom Blog Network. Data that you furnished to Mom Blog Network through the Site will remain in your online file, even if you are no longer participating in the network, and can be used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate Information.</strong> We use aggregate information collected at our Site to personalize your visit. With this data, we can provide content applicable to your particular location and interests. Aggregate information may also be shared with sponsors, advertisers, and partners for various reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Offers.</strong> On occasion, we are able to offer you special products or services through a relationship with a third party. In those cases, the offer will be brought to you by Mom Blog Network and fulfilled by the third party. If you accept the offer, you will become a customer of the company that is fulfilling the offer and we will not have control over their use of the personally identifiable information that you provide to them when you accept the offer.</p>
<p><strong>Refer a Friend.</strong> If you do become a Member, not only can you enjoy all of the benefits of membership, but you can also refer other individuals to join by providing us with their first names and email addresses. Using the information you give us on these potential Members, we will send them an email invitation to join Mom Blog Network. The only way these individuals can become Members, however, is if they come to our Site and sign up themselves. We do not use this information for any other purposes.</p>
<p><strong>We may receive requests to transfer information for legal purposes.</strong> We will disclose the identities of our users to comply with law or a legal request, such as a subpoena, court order, or other legal proceeding. We may also disclose personally identifiable information in order to enforce our rights under our agreement with our Members or to protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, employees and partners, including exchanging information for fraud and theft protection.</p>
<p><strong>Sale of Business or Assets.</strong> In the event that Mom Blog Network, substantially all of its assets, or a line of business are acquired or merged with another company, personally identifiable information of our Members may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction. Mom Blog Network will notify users of the Site of such a change in ownership or transfer of assets by posting a notice on the Site.</p>
<h3>III. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION</h3>
<p><strong>Mom Blog Network.com contains links to other sites.</strong> It is possible for you to receive information directly from our partners and other companies if you access them through a link on Mom Blog Network.com or if you go directly to their Websites. Once you are on their sites, any data that you supply to these partners, for example, to obtain information or buy products directly from them is beyond our reach and will be the responsibility of each of the linked-to entities and not Mom Blog Network. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Websites or any other sites linked to or referenced on our Site.</p>
<p><strong>Security.</strong> Mom Blog Network has multiple layers of security on its systems. We have implemented software and hardware security, including firewalls, data encryption, and private networks intended to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access. We use firewalls and intrusion-detection devices that are designed to defend against hackers and notify us if any attempts are made to compromise our network. Our Site utilizes SSL encryption when transmitting sensitive data such as credit card information. We regularly review additional software upgrades to enhance our security measures. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information, and your use of the Site indicates that you are willing to assume this risk.</p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy.</strong> Mom Blog Network does not encourage participation or visitation by children. Visitors who are known to be under the age of 18 are prohibited from becoming Mom Blog Network Members. Mom Blog Network does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18.</p>

However, we are unable to update or delete any of your personally identifiable information that has been shared with a third party as permitted in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy.</strong> We will inform you if we substantially modify the way we handle your personally identifiable information by posting a notice on the Site, and we will give you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Site.</p>
