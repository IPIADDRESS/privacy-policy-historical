We, and our affiliates, third party service providers, and business partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at our Sites and through our advertising and media across the Internet and mobile apps<b>.</b></p><p>Cookies are small text files containing information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website, including our Sites. Cookies are then sent back to the originating web domain on your subsequent visits to that domain. Most web pages contain elements from multiple web domains so when you visit a website, your browser may receive cookies from several sources. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's device. Cookies allow you to navigate websites efficiently, remember preferences and generally improve the user experience. They can also be used to tailor advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing across websites. Session cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser and persistent cookies remain on your device after the browser is closed (e.g. remembering your user preferences when you return to the Sites).</p><p>We may also use pixels or "web beacons" that monitor your use of our Sites. Web beacons are small electronic files integrated into the Sites or our communications (e.g. emails) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email or for other related statistics. We may also integrate "Software Development Kits" ("SDKs") into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with the Site and other mobile apps.</p><p>We may use cookies and other technologies to help recognize your browser or device, maintain your preferences, provide certain Site features, and collect Information about interactions with our Sites, our content, and our communications.</p><p>We may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our Sites, products, programs, and services and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Sites and marketing materials, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, (v) to synchronize users across devices, affiliates, business partners, and select third parties, and (vi) for us and our affiliates, business partners, and select third parties to target, offer, or market, products, programs, or services.

By visiting the Sites, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Sites through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.</p><p>You may adjust your browser to reject cookies. Controlling cookies via browser controls may not limit our use of other technologies. Please consult your browser's settings for more information. However, blocking cookies or similar technology might prevent you from accessing some of our content or features on the Sites. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not been yet developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p><p><b><u>Managing Cookies and Other Technologies.</u></b></p><p>Strictly Necessary Cookies</p><p>These <i>cookies</i> are essential in order to enable you to move around the Sites and use its features.

We may not accommodate a request to change or delete any information if we believe such action would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

Your use of the Sites from the European Union or any other place in the world means you agree to transfer, store and process your personal information to and in the United States, which laws may not provide the same level of protection of those in your country.

If you choose to access the Sites from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk.</p><p><b>DATA SECURITY</b></p><p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures for security of the Sites. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we take reasonable safeguards to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. Any transmission of personal information via the Internet is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.

Whalerock Industries, its affiliates and subsidiaries ("<b>Whalerock</b>", "<b>we</b>",
"<b>us</b>", or "<b>our</b>") values the privacy of our users and
subscribers. We strive to be transparent
about how we collect and use your Information (as defined below), to keep your
Information secure and to provide you with meaningful choices. This Privacy Policy ("<b><u>Policy</u></b>") describes the privacy
practices for <a href="http://www.Mom.me">www.Mom.me</a>, <a href="http://www.LatinaMom.me">www.LatinaMom.me</a>, and <a href="http://www.animals.mom.me">www.animals.mom.me</a> websites (each a "<b>Site</b>" or collectively, the "<u>Sites</u>"), which are owned, and operated, in whole or
in part, by Whalerock. This Policy explains how your Information is collected,
used, and disclosed by Whalerock as a data controller.</p><p>This
Policy applies to our online information practices for the Sites with respect
to users within the European Union. This Policy does not apply to personal data
collected through any third-party websites or apps, including websites you may
access through the Sites. Those websites
and apps may have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to read
before providing any personal information on or through them.</p><p>Please read this Policy carefully to understand our policies and
practices regarding your Information and how we will treat it. If you do not
agree with our policies and practices, do not use the Sites. By using the Sites,
you agree to this Policy. This Policy may change from time to time. Your
continued use of the Sites after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of
those changes, so please check the Policy periodically for updates.</p><h3>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h3><p>Our Sites are hosted in the United States. This means the Information
we collect will be processed by us in the United States, a country with a lower
standard of protection of personal data than the European Union. However, as we
offer our Sites, apps, and subscription services to residents in the European
Union, Whalerock is therefore also subject to European data protection laws, in
particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the <b><i>GDPR</i></b>).</p><p>Whalerock is in the process of appointing an EU representative and
will notify you through an updated version of this Policy once the EU
representative has been appointed.</p><p>We use instruments similar to the standard contractual clauses in accordance
with the GDPR when transferring your Information outside of European Union or
to third parties.</p><p>We may also limit the availability of the Sites or any service or
product described on the Sites to any person or geographic area at any time.</p><h3>CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 16</h3><p>The Sites are not intended for children under 16 years of age, and we do not knowingly
collect personal information from children under 16. If we learn we have
collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without
verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you
believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please
contact us at privacy@mom.me.</p><h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h3><p>We may collect and combine different types of information together, and collectively refer to all of this information in this Privacy Policy as "<b>Information</b>".

GDPR. We may share and disclose aggregated and de-identified Information about
our users without restriction.</p><p>Where we engage data processors that process personal data outside of the EEA we will
ensure that there will be an appropriate level of protection. In addition, we
will implement legal safeguards governing such transfer, such as instruments
similar to model contractual clauses, individuals' consent, or other legal
grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.</p><p>Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as
providing essentially equivalent protections as EEA data protection laws. EU
data protection laws allow Whalerock to freely transfer personal data to such countries.
Please contact us at privacy@mom.me if you would like to see a copy of the safeguards we apply in relation to the
export of your personal data.</p><p><b>Service Providers</b>. We have engaged the following categories of
data processors that process personal data on our behalf: our contractors,
service providers, content providers, and other third parties we use to support
our business may have access to Information to help carry out the services they
are performing for us, including: creating, maintaining, hosting, and delivering
of our Sites, products, and services; conducting marketing (for example to
provide you with targeted advertisements with appropriate consent); handling
payments, email and order fulfillment; administering contests; conducting
research and analytics; and customer service.</p><p><b>Marketing by affiliates and third parties.</b> We
may disclose Information to affiliates, business partners, and third parties
(e.g., retailers, advertisers, ad agencies, advertising networks and platforms,
research organizations, and other companies) whose practices are not covered by
this Privacy Policy and will act as controller. These parties may provide,
offer, improve, market, and otherwise communicate with you about their own
products and services. We will always ask your prior consent prior to any such
disclosure.</p><p><b>Sponsors and co-promotions</b>. We sometimes offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions,
or Social Media Site integrations) that are sponsored by or co-branded with
third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties collect or
obtain Information from you when you participate in the activity. We have no
control over these third parties' use of this Information. We encourage you to
look at the privacy disclosure of any such third party to learn about their
data practices before you participate in the activity.</p><p><b>Linked Sites</b>. Some Sites contain links to other sites,
including Social Media Sites. We may
integrate social media application program interfaces or plug-ins ("<u>Plug-ins</u>")
from social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and
others, into our Sites. Plug-ins may transfer information about you to the
Plug-in's respective platform without action by you. This information may
include your platform user identification number, which website you are on, and
more. Interacting with a Plug-in will transmit information directly to that
Plug-in's social network and that information may be visible by others on that
platform. Plug-ins are controlled by the respective platform's privacy policy,
and not by our Policy.</p><p><b>Legal and Law Enforcement Purposes</b>. We may
disclose Information in response to legal process, for example in response to a
court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency's
request. We may also disclose such Information
to third parties: (i) for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk
reduction, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or
take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) to enforce our rights arising
from any contracts entered into between you and us, including the Terms of Use,
this Policy, and for billing and collection, (iv) if we believe disclosure is necessary
or appropriate to protect our rights, property, or safety or that of our
customers, users, contractors or others, (v) as otherwise required by law.</p><h3>YOUR CHOICES</h3><p>Marketing Communications and Sharing with Third Parties. If you have
subscribed to receive newsletters and/or marketing information, you have an
opportunity to select your preferences with respect to receiving marketing
communications from us, and our sharing of Information with partners for their
direct marketing purposes.</p><p>You may update your preferences with
respect to receiving certain marketing communications from us, and our sharing
of personal information with third parties. You may do so by contacting us at privacy@mom.me. You may also opt out of receiving email marketing
communications, by following the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in every
email you receive from us. You may also adjust your push notifications on your
mobile device through your device or app settings.</p><p><b>Ad Choices</b><b>.</b> We may work with third parties to present advertisements, and engage
in data collection, reporting, site analytics, ad delivery and response
measurement on our Sites and on third party websites and applications over
time. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other
similar technology to perform this activity. They may also obtain information
about websites you visit, applications you use, and other information from
across your browsers and devices in order to present advertising that may be
tailored to your interests on and off our Sites and across other platforms.
This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising, and may be
used to associate various browsers and devices together for the purpose of
interest-based advertising and analytics.</p><p>For more information about
interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and your ability
to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties, please visit <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">Your Online Choices</a> and/or the EDAA <a href="https://www.edaa.eu/">Self-Regulatory Initiative for Online
Behavioral Advertising</a>. Please note that any opt-out choices you may
exercise through these programs will only apply to interest-based advertising
by the third parties you select. You may also continue to receive advertising,
but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.</p><p>You may have more options depending
on your operating system or mobile device. Most device operating systems provide their own instructions on how to
minimize or block delivery of tailored in-app advertising. You can review the privacy settings in such
operating system to learn about limiting of tailored in-app advertising. You may also disable precise location
information from a mobile device through your mobile device settings and choose
to limit that collection.</p><h4>Cookie Policy for EU Users</h4><p><b>Cookies and Other Technologies</b>. We,
and our affiliates, third party service providers, and business partners may
send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance
your online experience on our Sites and through our advertising and media
across the Internet and mobile apps.</p><p>Cookies are small text files containing information which
are downloaded to your device when you visit a website, including our Sites. Cookies are then sent back to the originating
web domain on your subsequent visits to that domain. Most web pages contain elements from multiple
web domains so when you visit a website, your browser may receive cookies from
several sources. Cookies are useful
because they allow a website to recognize a user's device. Cookies allow you to navigate websites
efficiently, remember preferences and generally improve the user
experience. They can also be used to
tailor advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing across
websites. Session cookies are deleted
automatically when you close your browser and persistent cookies remain on your
device after the browser is closed (e.g. remembering your user preferences when
you return to the Sites).</p><p>We may also use pixels or "web beacons" that
monitor your use of our Sites. Web beacons are small electronic files integrated
into the Sites or our communications (e.g. emails) that permit us, for example,
to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email or for other
related statistics. We may also integrate "Software Development Kits" ("SDKs")
into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons.
For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile
device identifiers and your interactions with the Site and other mobile apps.</p><p>We may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to
provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our Sites,
products, programs, and services and to operate our business, (ii) to perform
analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our
Sites and marketing materials, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent
fraud and other unlawful
activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our
users, (v) to synchronize users across
devices, affiliates, business partners, and select third parties, and (vi) for
us and our affiliates, business partners, and select third parties to target,
offer, or market, products, programs, or services. Cookies and other
technologies also facilitate and measure the performance of advertisements
displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites.</p><p>We currently do not respond to Do Not Track signals
because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and
may adopt a standard once one is created.</p><p><b>Managing Cookies and Other Technologies.</b></p><p><u>Strictly Necessary Cookies</u></p><p>These <em>cookies</em> are essential in order to enable you to move around the Sites and use
