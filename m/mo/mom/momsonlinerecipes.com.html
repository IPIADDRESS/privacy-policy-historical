					<br>
						<p><span class="bold">Date of Last Revision: October 12, 2011</span></p>
						
						<p><span class="bold">Scope.</span> This privacy policy covers all of Moms Online Recipes. It does not, however, apply to entities that Moms Online Recipes does not own or control, such as applications and websites using Platform. By using or accessing Moms Online Recipes, you agree to our privacy practices outlined here.<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">No information from children under age 14.</span> If you are under age 14, please do not attempt to register for Moms Online Recipes or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 14, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 14, please contact us at wrampd@gmail.com.<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">Parental participation.</span> We strongly recommend that minors 14 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices.</p>
						
						<p><br>
						<span class="bold">2. Information We Receive<br>
						<br>
						Information you provide to us:<br>
						<br>
						Information About Yourself.</span> When you sign up for Moms Online Recipes you provide us with your name, email, gender, and birth date. During the registration process we give you the opportunity to connect with any other member of this site. You will also be able to add a picture of yourself. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. Once you register you can provide other information about yourself by connecting with, for example, your current city, hometown, family, relationships, networks, activities, interests, and places. You can also provide personal information about yourself, such as your political and religious views.<br>
						</p>
						<div class="mainContentExtension">
							<p><span class="bold">Content.</span>Examples include when you upload or take a photo, upload or record a video, share a link, create an event or a group, make a comment, or send someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with content you share on Moms Online Recipes (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content.<br>
							
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Transactional Information.</span> We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on Moms Online Recipes. Currently, we do not store any credit card information. <br>
							<br>
							</p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Information we collect when you interact with Moms Online Recipes:</span><br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Site activity information.</span> We keep track of some of the actions you take on Moms Online Recipes, such as adding connections (including joining a group or adding a neighbor), creating a photo album, attending an event, or connecting with an application. In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide information or content to us. For example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact that you shared it.<br>
							
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Access Device and Browser Information.</span> When you access Moms Online Recipes from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Cookie Information.</span> We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make Moms Online Recipes easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and Moms Online Recipes. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to Moms Online Recipes. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into Moms Online Recipes, and to know when you are interacting with Moms Online Recipes Platform applications and websites, our widgets, and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Moms Online Recipes. Also, you hereby expressly consent to our aggregation of behavioral data for the purposes of using such data for behavioral targeting of advertisers on third-party websites.<br>
							Moms Online Recipes uses online behavioral advertising (�OBA�) and/or multi-site advertising in which information gathered through cookies, web beacons and similar means and is being used to select the advertisements displayed on the page so that they are more likely to be of interest to you. We may gather data such as click stream information, browser type, time and date and subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over.
							You may opt-out of our bahaviorial data tracking by visiting the opt-out page on the Network Advertising Initiative website located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Information we receive from third parties:</span><br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Moms Online Recipes Platform.</span> We do not own or operate the applications or websites that you use through Moms Online Recipes Platform (such as games and utilities). Whenever you connect with a Platform application or website, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take. In some cases, in order to personalize the process of connecting, we may receive a limited amount of information even before you connect with the application or website.<br>
							
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Information from other websites.</span> We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us:<br>
							</p>
							
							<ol>
							<li>We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn't see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as "conversion tracking," helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see.</li>
							<li>We may receive information about whether or not you've seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.</li>
							</ol>
							
							<p><br>
							<br>
							If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will "anonymize" it within 180 days, meaning we will stop associating the information with any particular user. If we institute these programs, we will only use the information in the ways we explain in the "How We Use Your Information" section below.<br>
							
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Information from other users.</span> We may collect information about you from other Moms Online Recipes users, such as when a friend lists you in a photo, video, or place, provides friend details, or indicates a relationship with you.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">3. Sharing information on Moms Online Recipes. </span><br>
							<br>
							This section explains how your privacy settings work, and how your information is shared on Moms Online Recipes. You should always consider your privacy settings before sharing information on Moms Online Recipes.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Name and Profile Picture.</span> Moms Online Recipes is designed to make it easy for you to find and connect with others. For this reason, your name and profile picture do not have privacy settings. If you are uncomfortable with sharing your profile picture, you should delete it (or not add one). </p>
							
							<p><br>
							<span class="bold">Contact Information.</span> Your contact information settings control (available when customizing your profile) allows you to hide certain information from public view. Remember that most of this information is not required except for your email address and gender.</p>
							
							<p><br>
							<span class="bold">Personal Information.</span> Your personal information settings control who can see your personal information, such as your religious and political views, if you choose to add them. <br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Gender and Birth Date.</span> In addition to name and email address, we require you to provide your gender and birth date during the registration process. We ask for your date of birth to verify that you are 14 or older, and so that we can better limit your access to content and advertisements that are not age appropriate. Because your date of birth and gender are required, you cannot delete them. You can, however, edit your profile to hide all (or part) of such fields from other users.<br>
							<br>
							
							<span class="bold">Other.</span> Here are some other things to remember:</p>
							
							<ol>
							<li>Some of the content you share and the actions you take may show up on your neighbors' home pages and other pages they visit.</li>
							<li>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.</li>
							<li>You understand that information might be reshared or copied by other users.</li>
							<li>Certain types of communications that you send to other users cannot be removed, such as messages.</li>
							<li>If you use an external source to publish information to Moms Online Recipes (such as a mobile application or a Connect site), you should check the privacy setting for that post, as it is set by that external source.</li>
							</ol>
							
							<p><br>
							<span class="bold">Minors.</span> We reserve the right to add special protections for minors (such as to provide them with an age-appropriate experience) and place restrictions on the ability of adults to share and connect with minors, recognizing this may provide minors a more limited experience on Moms Online Recipes<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">4. Information You Share With Third Parties.</span><br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Moms Online Recipes Platform.</span> As mentioned above, we do not own or operate the applications or websites that use Moms Online Recipes Platform. That means that when you use those applications and websites you are making your Moms Online Recipes information available to someone other than Moms Online Recipes. Prior to allowing them to access any information about you, we require them to agree to terms that limit their use of your information and we use technical measures to ensure that they only obtain authorized information. <br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Connecting with an Application or Website.</span> When you connect with an application or website it will have access to General Information about you. The term General Information includes your and your friends' names, profile pictures, gender, user IDs, connections, and any other content. We may also make information about the location of your computer or access device and your age available to applications and websites in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-appropriate content. If the application or website wants to access any other data, it will have to ask for your permission.</p>
							
							<p><br>
							You should always review the policies of third party applications and websites to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use information you share with them. We do not guarantee that they will follow our rules. If you find an application or website that violates our rules, you should report the violation to us at wrampd@gmail.com<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Pre-Approved Third-Party Websites and Applications.</span> In order to provide you with useful social experiences off of Moms Online Recipes, we occasionally need to provide General Information about you to pre-approved third party websites and applications that use Platform at the time you visit them (if you are still logged in to Moms Online Recipes). Similarly, when one of your friends visits a pre-approved website or application, it will receive General Information about you so you and your friend can be connected on that website as well (if you also have an account with that website). In these cases we require these websites and applications to go through an approval process, and to enter into separate agreements designed to protect your privacy. For example, these agreements include provisions relating to the access and deletion of your General Information, along with your ability to opt-out of the experience being offered. </p>
							
							<p><br>
							<span class="bold">Exporting Information.</span> You (and those you make your information available to) may use tools like RSS feeds, mobile phone address book applications, or copy and paste functions, to capture, export (and in some cases, import) information from Moms Online Recipes, including your information and information about you. For example, if you share your phone number with your friends, they may use third party applications to sync that information with the address book on their mobile phone.<br>
							<br>
							
							<span class="bold">Links.</span> When you click on links on Moms Online Recipes you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">5. How We Use Your Information</span><br>
							<br>
							We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">To manage the service.</span> We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support</p>
							
							<p><br>
							
							<span class="bold">To contact you.</span> We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. We may include content you see on Moms Online Recipes in the emails we send to you.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">To supplement your profile.</span> We may use information about you that we collect from other Moms Online Recipes users to supplement your profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in a status update). In such cases we generally give you the ability to remove the content (such as allowing you to remove a photo tag of you) or limit its visibility on your profile.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">To help your friends find you.</span> We allow other users to use contact information they have about you, such as your email address, to find you, including through contact importers and search. </p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Downloadable Software.</span> Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our browser toolbars and photo uploaders, transmit data to us. We may not make a formal disclosure if we believe our collection of and use of the information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the fact that we receive photos when you use our photo uploader. If we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such information, we will make a disclosure to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you want to use that feature.<br>
							
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Memorializing Accounts.</span> If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the user's account. In such cases we restrict profile access to confirmed friends, and allow friends and family to write on the user's Wall in remembrance. We may close an account if we receive a formal request from the user's next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">6. How We Share Information</span><br>
							<br>
							Moms Online Recipes is about sharing information with others - friends and people in your communities - while providing you with privacy settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing some of your information. We share your information with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so. For example:<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">When you make a payment.</span> When you enter into transactions with others or make payments on Moms Online Recipes, we will share transaction information with only those third parties necessary to complete the transaction. We will require those third parties to agree to respect the privacy of your information.<br>
							<br>
							
							<span class="bold">When you invite a friend to join.</span> When you ask us to invite a friend to join Moms Online Recipes, we will send your friend a message on your behalf using your name. </p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">When you choose to share your information with marketers.</span> You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers that are not associated with Moms Online Recipes through on-site offers. This is entirely at your discretion and we will not provide your information to these marketers without your consent.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">To help your friends find you.</span> By default, we make certain information you have posted to your profile available in search results on Moms Online Recipes to help your friends find you. </p>
							
							<p><br>
							<span class="bold">To give search engines access to publicly available information.</span> We allow them to access all information (along with your name and profile picture).</p>
							
							<p><br>
							<span class="bold">To help improve or promote our service.</span> Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">To provide you with services.</span> We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host our website, send out email updates about Moms Online Recipes, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links (including sponsored links). These service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">To advertise our services.</span> We may ask advertisers outside of Moms Online Recipes to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.<br>
							<br>
							
							<span class="bold">To offer joint services.</span> We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as the classifieds service in the Moms Online Recipes Marketplace. If you use these services, we may share your information to facilitate that service. However, we will identify the partner and present the joint service provider's privacy policy to you before you use that service.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</span> We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.</span> If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">7. How You Can Change or Remove Information</span><br>
							
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Editing your profile.</span> You may change or remove your profile information at any time by going to your profile page. Information will be updated immediately.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Deactivating or deleting your account.</span> We are currently working on ways to allow you to either delete or deactivate your account.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Limitations on removal.</span> Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information on Moms Online Recipes. (For example, if you post something to another user's profile and then you delete your account, that post may remain, but be attributed to an "Anonymous Moms Online Recipes User.") Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your information, they may retain your information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies. But they will no longer be able to access the information through our Platform after you disconnect from them.<br>
							<br>
							
							<span class="bold">Backup copies.</span> Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">8. How We Protect Information </span><br>
							<br>
							We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Steps we take to keep your information secure.</span> We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Risks inherent in sharing information.</span> Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on Moms Online Recipes will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on Moms Online Recipes. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.<br>
							
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Report Violations.</span> You should report any security violations to us at wrampd@gmail.com.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">9. Other Terms</span><br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Changes.</span> We may change this Privacy Policy pursuant to the procedures outlined in the Moms Online Recipes <a href="http://www.MomsOnlineRecipes.com/pages/privacy">Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</a>. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication here and by email and a message in your message center on Moms Online Recipes. If the changes are material, we will provide you additional, prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Consent to Collection and Processing in the United States.</span> By using Moms Online Recipes, you consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.<br>
							
							<br>
							<span class="bold">Defined Terms.</span> "Us," "we," "our," "Platform" and "Moms Online Recipes" mean the same as they do in the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. "Information" and "content" are used more generally and interchangeably here than in the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities unless otherwise limited by the context.</p>
