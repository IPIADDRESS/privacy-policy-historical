<p><strong>Posting Content using Moxtra Products</strong></p>
<p>If you provide or upload content using a Moxtra Product, you should be aware that the information you provide there may be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside Moxtra, who have access to that Moxtra binder or another content repository. Any content provided by a user is solely the responsibility of that user and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Moxtra.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s privacy</strong></p>
<p>Moxtra does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems. Moxtra encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child’s online experience safer: Teach children never to give Personal Information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate.<br>
Look for website privacy policies. Know how your child’s information is treated. Please visit the FTC’s website for more tips on protecting children’s privacy online.</p>
<p><strong>Consent to Transfer, Processing and Storage of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We may transfer your Personal Information to the United States, to any Moxtra affiliate worldwide, or to third parties acting on our behalf for the purposes of processing or storage, and by providing any Personal Information you fully understand and unambiguously consent to such transfer, processing and storage of such information.</p>
<p><strong>Questions or comments?</strong> Should you have any privacy-related questions or comments related to this privacy policy, please send an email to privacy@moxtra.com.</p>
<p><strong>Policy updates:</strong> Moxtra may amend this privacy statement from time to time, and at any time. We will post a notice whenever this privacy statement is materially changed. Your continued use of the Moxtra website or Products after any change will signify and confirm your assent to those changes.</p>
