                            <h4>Non-personal/anonymous information collection</h4>
                            <p>In some instances, Moxtra may collect non-personal (aggregate or demographic) data through cookies, web logs, and web beacons. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website. Please read the “Cookies” section below for more information.</p>
                            <p>In addition, by using some of our Products, anonymous network information may be transmitted back to us such as Product usage information. This information is transmitted back to us so we can determine how users are interacting with our Products, to assist us with improving our Products, and to correct any problems that may occur.</p>
                            <h4>Sharing your personal information</h4>
                            <p>We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so.</p>
                            <p>We may share your Personal Information within Moxtra and its affiliated companies and with third party service providers for purposes of data processing or storage.</p>
                            <p>We may also share your Personal Information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested Product or transaction, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support. We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of Personal Information necessary to complete/utilize the requested Product or transaction, and the third parties are not permitted to use your Personal Information except for limited purpose of completing/providing the requested Product or transaction.</p>
                            <p>We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your Personal Information and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
                            <p>We may collect and possibly share Personal Information and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Moxtra’s terms of service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
                            <p>While navigating Moxtra’s web site or Products you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third-party supplier. When information is collected on behalf of Moxtra exclusively, Moxtra’s privacy policy will be referenced and will govern how your information is used. For other, non-Moxtra sites or services, the site/service owner’s privacy policy will be referenced. You should review such supplier’s privacy and security policies prior to use.</p>
                            <p>We will ask for your consent before we use or share your information for any purpose other than the reason you provided it or as otherwise provided by this policy. In order to let us know your preferences, we will require an action on your part, such as checking the appropriate option, to indicate your consent.</p>
                            <h4>Security of your Personal Information</h4>
                            <p>Moxtra is committed to protecting the Personal Information you share with us. We utilize a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</p>
                            <p>When we transfer credit card information over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.</p>
                            <p>While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit.</p>
                            <p>We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser.</p>
                            <h4>Cookies</h4>
                            <p>Like many websites, Moxtra uses technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, which allow us to make your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return.</p>
                            <p>A cookie cannot read personal data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; indeed, the only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience and track user traffic patterns, and to merge this info when you register. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. You may browse most of Moxtra’s website without accepting cookies from Moxtra; however, some website functionality may be lost by disabling cookies on your computer. Other Moxtra web pages, particularly those which require a login and password, require cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled cookies in your browser.</p>
                            <p>In addition, Moxtra uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to understand user behavior. Web beacons are simply a convenient way of gathering basic statistics and managing cookies, and do not give away any extra information from your computer. Turning off your browser’s cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity.</p>
                            <p>If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website or via HTML-formatted emails, you can set your browser to warn you before it accepts cookies or refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You may browse most of the Moxtra website without accepting cookies; however, some website functionality may be lost by disabling cookies on your computer. Other Moxtra web pages, particularly those which require a login and password, require cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled cookies in your browser.

                            <h4>Linked websites and third party services</h4>
                            <p>Our websites and services may provide links to other third-party websites and services which are outside our control and not covered by this policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites you visit or services you use.</p>
                            <h4>Content</h4>
                            <p>If you provide or upload content to a Moxtra website or Xebinder, you should be aware that the information you provide there may be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside Moxtra, who have access to that Xebinder or other content repository. Any content provided by a user is solely the responsibility of that user and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Moxtra.</p>
                            <h4>Children’s privacy</h4>
                            <p>Moxtra does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems. Moxtra encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child’s online experience safer:</p>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; list-style-position: inside;">
                                <li>Teach children never to give Personal Information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.</li>
                                <li>Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate.</li>
                                <li>Look for website privacy policies. Know how your child’s information is treated.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Please visit the FTC’s website for more tips on protecting children’s privacy online.</p>
                            <h4>Consent to Transfer, Processing and Storage of Personal Information</h4>
                            <p>We may transfer your Personal Information to the United States, to any Moxtra affiliate worldwide, or to third parties acting on our behalf for the purposes of processing or storage, and by providing any Personal Information you fully understand and unambiguously consent to such transfer, processing and storage of such information.</p>
                            <h4>Questions or comments?</h4>
                            <p>Should you have any privacy-related questions or comments related to this privacy policy, please send an email to privacy@Moxtra.com.</p>
