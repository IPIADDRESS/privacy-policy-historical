<p>This privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") covers the website www.Moxsie.com, owned 
and operated by Moxsie, Inc. ("Moxsie", "we", "us", "our").  Moxsie knows that you care 
about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy 
seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.  By visiting the 
Moxsie website, submitting information or using any of our products or services, you are 
accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.  You are also consenting to have 
your data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>



<p><strong>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</strong><br>

This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personal information that we gather when you 
are on the Moxsie website and when you use Moxsie services.  The types of personal 

information collected include your name, your address, your e-mail address, your telephone 

number, your gender, schools attended and any other personal or preference information 

that you provide to us.  Also, this Privacy Policy covers Moxsie's treatment of any 

personal information that Moxsie's business partners share with Moxsie.  This policy does 

not apply to the practices of third parties that Moxsie does not own or control, or to 

individuals that Moxsie does not employ or manage.</p>



<p><strong>What Personal Information About Users Does Moxsie Collect?</strong><br>

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to personalize and improve our 

service. We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>



<p></p>A)  Information You Provide to Us: <br> 

We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in 

any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you 

may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.  The personal 

information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests 

for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and 

communicating with you about specials, sales offers and new products. <p></p> 

<p>Registration: In order for you to use our website, you must complete a registration 

form.  As part of this registration form, we require your first and last name, your email 

address, your password, your country, your city and confirmation that you are 13 years 

or older and that you agree to the terms and conditions of Moxsie.com.

When you use Moxsie, you may set up your profile, form relationships, send 

messages, perform searches and queries, set up events, make want and have lists, post 

finds and brags, comment and transmit information through various channels.  In most 

cases, we retain it so that you can return to view saved lists or sent messages.  When 

you update your information, we usually keep a back-up copy of the prior version for a 

reasonable period of time.  We collect this information in order to provide you the 

service and offer you a more personalized and relevant experience on Moxsie.

You post user content [DEFINE?] at your own risk. Although we allow you to set 

privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security 

measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with 

whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and 

do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by 

unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings 

or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even 

after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived 

pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>



<p>B)   Automatic Information:<br>

</p><p>• We may receive and store use information whenever you interact with us.  Moxsie may 

automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your 

browser including your browser type, IP address, Moxsie cookie information, and the 

page you requested.  Moxsie uses this traffic data, among other things,  to help 

diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the website.  </p> 

<p>• Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the 

numbers and frequency of visitors to our website and its components. This type of 

collective data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the website, so we 

can make the website appealing to as many users as possible. In addition, we may 

provide statistical information to our partners about how our users collectively use our 

website.   We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how 

often people use their areas and our website, so that they, too, may provide you with an 

optimal Web experience.  </p>

<p>• We may use  information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to 

third parties.  We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a 

network like an item, a store, or a brand and personalizing advertisements and 

promotions so that we can provide you with a more relevant and personalized 

experience on Moxsie.  We believe this benefits you.  For example, if you put a favorite 

pair of jeans in your Style-list, add a brand as a friend, or put an item from your Closet 

in the "Love it" box we might serve you an advertisement highlighting items of a 

similar style from a different brand or store.  But we don't tell the brand or store who 

you are. </p> 

<p>• We may also use information about you that we collect when you use our tools on other 

websites.  For example, if you add golf clubs to your Moxsie Tote from an outside 

website, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting golf clothes from a different 

brand or store.</p>

<p>• Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously.  While 

Moxsie will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot 

recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</p>
<p></p>


<p>C)   E-mail Communications:<br>

•We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Moxsie if your 

computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more 

interesting and helpful.  We may also send out emails with news or promotions.  If you 

do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at 

unsubscribe@moxsie.com and include sufficient information for us to identify your 

account.</p>

<p>•If you choose to use our information service to tell a contact about our site, we will ask 

you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your contact's email address.  

We will automatically send your contact a one-time email or instant message inviting 

him, her or them to visit the site.  Moxsie stores this information to send this one-time 

invitation, to register a contact connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the 

success of our referral program.  Your contact may contact us at info@moxsie.com to 

request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<p>D)   Information from Other Sources:<br>

For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information 

about you from other sources and add it to our account information.</p> 

<p><strong>What about Cookies?</strong><br>

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer's hard 

drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and 

tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. We 

store certain information from your browser using cookies.  We use session ID cookies 

to confirm that users are logged in.  These cookies terminate once the user closes the 

browser.  By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your 

password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Moxsie.  You can 

remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable 

this convenience feature.</p>

<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to 

prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell 

you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.  We strongly 

recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you 

to take advantage of some of Moxsie's most attractive features.</p>

<p>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, 

advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>

<p><strong>Will Moxsie Share My Mailing Lists or Address Book Information with Third 

Parties?</strong><br>

We understand that businesses on Moxsie — such as brands, stores, or other Moxsie 

business partners — have customer email lists that they consider proprietary.  Moxsie 

respects the confidential nature of these email lists and does not rent or sell this information 

to anyone.  Moxsie asks you to invite your friends to join Moxsie by giving us access to 

your address book information and allowing us to send emails on your behalf to your 

contacts.  We do this because the more contacts you have on Moxsie, the better it works.   

For example, each of your contacts on Moxsie is connected to many other contacts that may 

not be connected to you.  Thus, if Jane is a fan of your brand or boutique, Jane's friends 

can find out about you through her profile.  Moxsie has also created special software for 

brands and stores that help you more easily manage your communications with your 

customers and fans on Moxsie.  We want you to be able to take advantage of our services 

with full confidence that your email lists will not be shared with anyone, especially your 

competitors.</p>  



<p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties.</strong><br>

Moxsie is about sharing information with others — friends, designers, brands and boutiques 

in your network — this is how you can find out about new products, sales, and special 

events through your friends.  The relationships among the people in your network allow us 

to recommend products and stores to you that your friends know, trust, and recommend.  

Our service, and the reliability of the recommendations that we provide to you, depend on 

trust relationships that you and your friends have established with the people, designers, 

and stores in your network.  This is why you should never add a designer, person, or store 

that you do not like, know, or trust as a friend.  Although Moxsie is about sharing 

information, we provide you with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing 

your information.  We allow you to choose the information you provide to friends and 

networks through Moxsie.  Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you 

to make informed choices about who has access to your personal information.  We do not 

provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission.  We share 

your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such 

sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted 

by you.  For example:</p>


<p>• Your news feed may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to 

your friends and network members according to your privacy settings.</p> 

<p>• We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services 

we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to 

host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about 

Moxsie, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments 

for products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide 

offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your 

personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business 

activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal 
</p></div><div id="contentbar"><br>
information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting 

the use of that information to the Moxsie-specified purposes.<p></p>

<p>• We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse 

into the Moxsie world. Such accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., 

messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit possible 

misuse.</p>

<p>• We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such 

as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not 

reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by 

law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, 

we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to 

comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other 

illegal activity perpetrated through the Moxsie service or using the Moxsie name, or 

to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other 

companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>

<p>• We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce 

providers through sponsored groups or other on-site offers.</p>

<p>• We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Moxsie. 

You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on 

Moxsie, and we may share customer information with that company in connection 

with your use of that store or service.</p>

<p>• Moxsie's Tote is a means of letting you collect data (e.g. images of products) from 

third party sites and of sharing that data with your friends on Moxsie. In addition to 

the product images that you collect and store in your style-list or wishlist, we collect 

certain information related to the products you select from that site (e.g. the URL, 

color, price, style, brand, etc.).   We collect this data to allow us to give you better 

product recommendations in the future and to enable you to link back to the 

originating site by clicking on the product image.  Although your friends can see the 

images you collect when they visit your closet and style-list, they are not notified 

that have collected this data or when you take actions pertaining to the data .</p>

<p>• If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Moxsie business, or individual 

business units owned by Moxsie, Inc., were to change, your user information may 

be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such 

transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises 

made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>



<p>When you use Moxsie, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a 

friend or someone in your network), such as personal information, comments, messages, 

photos, videos, or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the 

privacy settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. 

Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information in your profile or when 

posting comments, messages, photos, videos, or other items , this information may become 

publicly available.</p>

<p><strong>Affiliated Business We Do Not Control:</strong><br>

We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them.  You can 

easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction.  We 

will only share personal information that is necessary for the affiliate to complete the 

transaction.  We require our affiliates to provide the same level of privacy protection 

that we do and they do not have the right to share or use personal information for any 

purpose other than for an authorized transaction.</p>

<p>• Personnel:  <br>

Our personnel (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consultants and/or contractors) 

may have access to user information while carrying out their duties in the normal course 

of our company business.</p> 

<p>• Agents:<br>

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to 

share your information with them to provide products or services to you.  Examples 

include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer 

lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, 

and providing customer service.  You hereby consent to our sharing of your personal 

information for the above purposes. </p> 

<p>• Promotional Offers:<br>

We may send offers to certain users on behalf of other businesses.  However, when we 

do so, we do not give the other business your name and address.  If you do not wish to 

receive these offers, please notify us by e-mail at unsubscribe@moxsie.com.</p>

<p>• Business Transfers:<br>

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, 

customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.  

Moreover, if Moxsie, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, customer 

information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.</p>

<p>• Protection of Moxsie and Others:<br>

We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is 

necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other 

agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Moxsie, our employees, our 

users, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and 

organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

<p><strong>Is Information About Me Secure?</strong><br>

Your Moxsie account information is protected by a password for your privacy and 

security.  You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password 

and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.</p>

<p>Only Moxsie employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for 

example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it.  All of our 

employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p>

<p><strong>What Information Can I Access?</strong><br>

You can access your personal information on our website and correct, amend, or delete 

information that is inaccurate. To edit your personal information, go to your profile and 

click the edit button in the about section or go to the basic menu.</p>


<p><strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong><br>

As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may 

be unable to use certain features on our website.</p>

<p>You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the 

"What Personal Information About Users Does Moxsie Collect?" section above.  When 

you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised 

information in our records.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at 

unsubscribe@moxsie.com.  Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices 

from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the 

Moxsie website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p>

<p>As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will 

direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to 

command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully 

disable cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, 

you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.</p>

<p><strong>Can Children Use Moxsie's Services?</strong><br>

Moxsie does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone 

under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are 

under 13, please do not attempt to register for Moxsie or send any information 

about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email 

address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on 

Moxsie. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information 

from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will 

delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have 

any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at 

info@moxsie.com. We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their 

parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to 

anyone over the Internet.</p>

arbitration of disputes, and application of California state law.</p>

Moxsie control.  The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the

the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>

Moxsie may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion.  Use of 

information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such 

information is used.  If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by

<p><strong>Effective Date of This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 20, 2008.</p>
<p>
The best way to describe us is a cross between an online fashion magazine and a social network for fashion where designers can put their videos, collections, photographs, stories, link to stores that carry them or even sell direct online. We know how hard it is for smaller deginers to get noticed even when they are talented; so, Moxsie makes it easy for people to fined them and buy from them. We give talented designers a plataform where they can gain international exposure and connect and communicate with people that matter - be they boutiques, retailers, others brands, or Fashionistas that love their stuff.</p>
<p>
We are continually scouting out the most cutting edge retailers, brands and designers around the world. We would be delighted to hear about brands you would like featured - just <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
