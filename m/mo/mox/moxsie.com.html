By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Moxsie. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Moxsie's most attractive features.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>

<p><b>Will Moxsie Share My Mailing Lists or Address Book Information with Third Parties?</b></p>
<p>We understand that businesses on Moxsie — such as brands, stores, or other Moxsie business partners — have customer email lists that they consider proprietary. Moxsie respects the confidential nature of these email lists and does not rent or sell this information to anyone. Moxsie asks you to invite your friends to join Moxsie by giving us access to your address book information and allowing us to send emails on your behalf to your contacts. We do this because the more contacts you have on Moxsie, the better it works. For example, each of your contacts on Moxsie is connected to many other contacts that may not be connected to you. Thus, if Jane is a fan of your brand or boutique, Jane's friends can find out about you through her profile. Moxsie has also created special software for brands and stores that help you more easily manage your communications with your customers and fans on Moxsie. We want you to be able to take advantage of our services with full confidence that your email lists will not be shared with anyone, especially your competitors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties.</b></p>
<p>Moxsie is about sharing information with others — friends, designers, brands and boutiques in your network — this is how you can find out about new products, sales, and special events through your friends. The relationships among the people in your network allow us to recommend products and stores to you that your friends know, trust, and recommend. Our service, and the reliability of the recommendations that we provide to you, depend on trust relationships that you and your friends have established with the people, designers, and stores in your network. This is why you should never add a designer, person, or store that you do not like, know, or trust as a friend. Although Moxsie is about sharing information, we provide you with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information. We allow you to choose the information you provide to friends and networks through Moxsie. Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to make informed choices about who has access to your personal information. We do not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For example: </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Moxsie, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Moxsie-specified purposes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the Moxsie world. Such accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit possible misuse.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Moxsie service or using the Moxsie name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored groups or other on-site offers if and when this functionality is provided.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Moxsie. You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on Moxsie, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Moxsie business, or individual business units owned by Moxsie, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When you use Moxsie, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or someone in your network), such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, videos, or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information in your profile or when posting comments, messages, photos, videos, or other items, this information may become publicly available.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Affiliated Business We Do Not Control:</b></p>
<p>We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction. We will only share personal information that is necessary for the affiliate to complete the transaction. We require our affiliates to provide the same level of privacy protection that we do and they do not have the right to share or use personal information for any purpose other than for an authorized transaction.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• Personnel:</p>
<p>Our personnel (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consultants and/or contractors) may have access to user information while carrying out their duties in the normal course of our company business.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• Agents:</p>
<p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. You hereby consent to our sharing of your personal information for the above purposes.<br>
<br></p>
<p>• Promotional Offers:</p>
<p>We may send offers to certain users on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please notify us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@moxsie.com">unsubscribe@moxsie.com</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• Business Transfers:</p>
<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Moxsie, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• Protection of Moxsie and Others:</p>
<p>We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Moxsie, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Is Information About Me Secure?</b></p>
<p>Your Moxsie account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Only Moxsie employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>What Information Can I Access?</b></p>
<p>You can access your personal information on our website and correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate. To edit your personal information, go to your profile and click the edit button in the about section or go to the basic menu.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>What Choices Do I Have?</b></p>
<p>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our website.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the "What Personal Information About Users Does Moxsie Collect?" section above. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@moxsie.com">unsubscribe@moxsie.com</a>. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Moxsie website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Can Children Use Moxsie's Services?</b></p>
<p>Moxsie does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for Moxsie or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on Moxsie. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@moxsie.com">info@moxsie.com</a>. We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The best way to describe us is a cross between an online fashion magazine and a social network for fashion where designers can put their videos, collections, photographs, stories, link to stores that carry them or even sell direct online. We know how hard it is for smaller deginers to get noticed even when they are talented; so, Moxsie makes it easy for people to fined them and buy from them. We give talented designers a plataform where they can gain international exposure and connect and communicate with people that matter - be they boutiques, retailers, others brands, or Fashionistas that love their stuff.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are continually scouting out the most cutting edge retailers, brands and designers around the world. We would be delighted to hear about brands you would like featured - just contact us.</p>            </div>
