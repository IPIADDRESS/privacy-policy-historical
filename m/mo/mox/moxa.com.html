We use the data that you provide for purposes administering your use of our services, such as communicating with you, responding to your requests, managing your account, customizing your service experience with us, improving our products and services, and personalizing marketing measures and activities.  We may communicate with you by mail, email or telephone. We will send you strictly service-related announcements or information on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.

                                    We also receive and store certain types of data whenever you interact with us. For example, we use "cookies," which are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to provide features of our services such as personalized advertisements on other websites, provide remote access for you, allow you to visit our website without re-entering your username and/or password, verify that you have the authorization needed for the services to process your requests, personalize and improve your experience, record your preferences, customize functionalities for your devices, and to improve the functionality and user-friendliness of our services. It also helps us to better understand how you interact with our services and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our website. Most of the cookies used by us are so-called "session cookies". Cookies do not cause any damage on your computer and do not contain any viruses. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify your browser setting by editing your browser options to reject our cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. However, if a browser does not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, some portions of our services may not function properly.

These log files are used for analysis, research, auditing, and other purposes. Your data is stored in log files until the data is transferred to backup databases.  We routinely back up a copy of your data to prevent loss of your data in case of a server breakdown or human error. However, all such copies of your data in our backup database will be retained only for as long as our data retention policy permits (see “How long do we keep your personal data?” below), and will in any case be deleted immediately upon your request.

                                As noted in the “Sharing your personal data” section of this Statement, as a globally operating company, we may share your information with our affiliate companies or third parties.  Please refer to the “Sharing your personal data” section of this Statement for the recipients of your data and the reasons for our provision of your data to them. Where such entities are located in other countries and jurisdictions, we will therefore be transferring your personal data outside of the European Economic Area.  In making such data transfers, we make sure to protect your personal data by applying the level of security required by the applicable privacy laws.  Where we transfer your data to a country or jurisdiction that cannot guarantee the required level of protection as required by applicable privacy laws, we have enhanced our IT security measures and have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses with the transferee to require security obligations on the transferee, both of which are intended to increase the protection of your personal data. Standard Contractual Clauses are one of a number of "appropriate safeguards" under the applicable privacy laws that enable the transfer of personal data concerning data subjects within the European Economic Area to jurisdictions that have not been designated by the European Commission as possessing an adequate level of data protection.  You may request a copy of such Standard Contractual Clauses from us, or inquire about transfers of your information, by providing your request to the responsible committee set forth in the “Contact Us” section.

Therefore, we collect the basic information you provide to us when you opt into our communications (such as email address, company name, industry, country, etc.) in order to supply you with content that is applicable to your business and job role.  We will also couple that with any inferred data you provide through actions you take when interacting with the content we offer you.

										<li>To the extent possible, our priority is to use anonymized or pseudonymized data, instead of data that can directly or indirectly identify you, in our profiling activities.</li>
