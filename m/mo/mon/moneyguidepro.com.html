									<span class="loginkeypointtext">What Financial Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?</span><br>
									To use our software, we ask 
									you to input personal financial data for you and, if applicable, your spouse.  The 
									personal financial data we request includes such data as annual income, current 
									values of and annual additions to investment assets, anticipated retirement expenses, 
									expected values of future assets such as lump sum distributions from pensions or 
									inheritances. In many instances, these entries are optional.  This personal 
									financial information will be used by your financial advisor, in conjunction 
									with our software, to develop financial, asset allocation, and income plan(s) or analyses for 
									you.  Naturally, the more detailed the financial information you provide, the 
									more accurate the plan(s) or analyses can be.
