									<span class="loginkeypointlicensetext">What Personal Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?</span><br>
									When you register, we will ask you for your name, email address, and contact information. 
									You will also be asked to select a user name and password.
									</p><p>
									We use your name to personalize your reports generated by the system. We use your email

									As a registered user, when you select the option to create or access your financial plans, we will 
									recognize you by your user name and password.  We may also use the contact information we collect to

									<span class="loginkeypointlicensetext">What Financial Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?</span><br>
									To use our financial planning, asset allocation and/or income planning software, we ask 
									you to input personal financial data for you and, if applicable, your spouse.  The 
									personal financial data we request includes such data as annual income, current 
									values of and annual additions to investment assets, anticipated retirement expenses, 
									expected values of future assets such as lump sum distributions from pensions or 
									inheritances. In many instances, these entries are optional.  This personal 
									financial information will be used by your financial advisor, in conjunction 
									with our software, to develop financial, asset allocation, and income plan(s) for 
									you.  Naturally, the more detailed the financial information you provide, the 
									more accurate the plan(s) can be.
