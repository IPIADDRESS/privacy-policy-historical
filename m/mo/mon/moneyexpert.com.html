<h3>How we protect your Personal Data</h3>
<p>Protecting your information is one of our top priorities, we use a world leading hosting service, who hold all of your data, and host our web services in London. Any individual with access to your data goes through a rigorous reference and disbarring services check, and no hard copies of Personal Data are created at any point.&nbsp; All data transfer is secured using modern encryption technologies.</p>
<p>ME Expert is exclusively a Data Controller with respect to all Personal Data entered into our websites directly. In the event that this information is used by a consumer to form a contract or acquire a service from a party through our services it is often the case that ME Expert will be a Data Controller and maintain a Joint-Controller relationship with this third party, with each entity controlling the Personal Data collected, and ME Expert acting as a Data Processor with respect to the copy provided to the third party.&nbsp; This information is only copied and provided to such a third party in order for a consumer to form contract for services with the third party, and only when explicit consent to do so has been provided by the consumer.</p>
<p>Frequently a consumer may be forwarded to an application hosted directly by the party operating the service applied for, in these instances ME Expert is to be a Data Processor, and any data provided to ME Expert from this party will only be used for the purposes explicitly stated at the time of application for their service.</p>
<h3>Personal Data disclosure outside of the UK</h3>
<p>ME Expert may at times transfer your Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).&nbsp; We will only do so when we have utilised means to ensure the level of data protection is equivalent to the level afforded in the UK by law, for example when transferred by use of a data-transfer agreement incorporating standard model protection clauses and ensuring that the party receiving the Personal Data has sufficient security processes in place.</p>
<h3>Helping with your Insurance quotation</h3>
<p>By submitting an insurance quotation through our website, you are asked to explicitly agree that the top 3 Insurance providers and/or brokerages in your search results may contact you by telephone for a limited time following the submission of your enquiry. This allows the insurance provider and/or brokerages to enquire as to whether you would like to proceed with the quotation, and also allows them, where applicable, to see if they are able to present you with any special offers, further discounts or incentives relating to the quotation you received.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that some quotes may be completed on a third party website, in these instances your information would be input directly into their systems, and it is your responsibility to review their privacy policy and / or their terms of service.</p>
<h3>Call Monitoring</h3>
<p>Phone calls to ME Expert may be recorded for training and monitoring purposes, or for the formation of a verbal contract with which a service may be performed. &nbsp;The required consent for this purpose will be obtained in an explicit manner, and the information captured in such a recording may be processed only for the reasons stated.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Credit Reference Searches</h3>
<p>Please note that we or our Trusted Business Partners may make, or cause searches to be made, at a credit reference agency, or agencies. You should be aware that such searches will be shown in any other searches that are made in connection with credit applications made by yourself or other members of your household. The disclosure of multiple searches may adversely affect your credit profile and may make credit more difficult for you, or other members of your household, to obtain.</p>
<p>View our Marketing Policy <a href="/marketing-policy">here</a></p>

<h3>Automated decision making</h3>

<p>If any information we hold is inaccurate, we will make the necessary amendments and confirm to you have that these have been made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We are required to restrict the processing of Personal Data in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where an individual contests the accuracy of the Personal Data, ME must restrict the processing until ME have verified the accuracy of the Personal Data.</li>
<li>Where an individual has objected to the processing (where it was necessary for the performance of a public interest task or purpose of legitimate interests), and ME are considering whether ME’s legitimate grounds override those of the individual.</li>
<li>When processing is unlawful and the individual opposes erasure and requests restriction instead.</li>
<li>If we no longer need the Personal Data but the individual requires the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.</li>
</ul>
