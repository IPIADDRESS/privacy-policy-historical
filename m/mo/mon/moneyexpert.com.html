        <h3>Information disclosure outside of the UK</h3>
       <p> It is possible that, by using our services, your data will be transferred to companies outside of the European 
        Union, for example where the partners’ computer systems or calls centres are based abroad.  MoneyExpert will 
        only transfer your personal details outside of the European Union where the partner(s) have confirmed, via 
        contractual agreement, that they will hold and use your personal data in line with European Union standards.</p>

        <h2>Helping with your Insurance quotation</h2>
        By submitting an insurance quotation through our website, you agree that the top 3 Insurance providers and/or 
        brokerages in your search results may contact you by telephone for a limited time following the submission of 
        your enquiry.  This allows the insurance provider and/or brokerages to enquire as to whether you would like to 
        proceed with the quotation, and also allows them, where applicable, to see if they are able to present you with 
        any special offers, further discounts or incentives relating to the quotation you received.<p></p>

        <h2>Call Monitoring</h2>
      <p>  Phone calls to MoneyExpert may be recorded for training and monitoring purposes, in accordance with UK law.</p>

        agency, or agencies. You should be aware that such searches will be shown in any other searches that are made in 
        connection with credit applications made by yourself or other members of your household. The disclosure of 
        multiple searches may adversely affect your credit profile and may make credit more difficult for you, or 
        other members of your household, to obtain.</p>
