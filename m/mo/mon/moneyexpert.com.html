by us, or on our behalf, or on behalf of our trading name Simply Switch.
</p>
<h3>Who we share your Personal Data with</h3>

MoneyExpert contacting you by phone, e-mail or otherwise to inform you about products and services
that may be of interest to you, this consent is to be formed through an explicit means on the quote

</p>
<h3>How do I unsubscribe?</h3>
<p>
You may unsubscribe at any time by emailing us at unsubscribe@moneyexpert.com, requesting that your
email address is removed, or by utilising our privacy
<a href="https://www.moneyexpert.com/preference-centre/">preference centre</a>.
</p>
<p>
ME Expertâs price comparison service involves us passing the details you input on our website
to our partners, or in other cases your information being input directly into their system, please
be aware that at any point where you have been forwarded to a third party website it is your
responsibility to review their applicable terms of service and privacy policy. This enables our
partners to provide us with quotations on the products and services that you have requested. If you
do decide to enter into a contract with one of our partners, then the information which we have supplied
to them (as well as any further information requested by them to enable to them to complete the contract)
will be held by the partner. You are therefore advised to read the partners privacy policy before
entering into any contract with them.
</p>
<p>We may also share your Personal Data with other professional advisers, financial organisations and
advisers, sponsors and advertisers. With respect to these partners ME Expert is a Data Controller
for any data input into the ME Expert or Simply Switch, websites. At times you may be linked to the
website of the party offering the service to you to complete an application and, in these instances,
ME Expert is to be a Joint Data Controller unless otherwise stated. Such parties may contact you by
phone, e-mail or otherwise to inform you about any products and services that may be of interest to
you, subject to your consent.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
If your enquiry regards Mortgage advice, we will arrange for one of our partners to contact you by phone.
In some circumstances, we may arrange for an alternative Mortgage Adviser to contact you. In these cases,
we will notify you of the name of the adviser and request your permission for your details to be sent to
them before any contact is made.
</p>
<p>Further information about who we share your information with can be found in our
<a href="https://www.moneyexpert.com/marketing-policy/">marketing policy</a>.
</p>
<p>
MoneyExpert may also disclose your Personal Data to government bodies and regulators where required
to do so by law, or where necessary for ME Expert to fulfil our regulatory obligations.
</p>
<h3>How we protect your Personal Data</h3>
 <p>
Protecting your information is one of our top priorities, we use a world leading hosting service,
who securely hold all of your data, and even host our web services in London. Any individual with
access to your data goes through a rigorous reference and disbarring services check, and no hard
copies of Personal Data are created at any point. All data transfer is secured using modern encryption technologies.
</p>
<p>
ME Expert is exclusively a Data Controller with respect to all Personal Data entered into our websites directly. In the event that this information is used by a consumer to form a contract or acquire a service from a party through our services it is often the case that ME Expert will be a Data Controller and maintain a Joint-Controller relationship with this third party, with each entity controlling the Personal Data collected, and ME Expert acting as a Data Processor with respect to the copy provided to the third party. This information is only copied and provided to such a third party in order for a consumer to form contract for services with the third party, and only when explicit consent to do so has been provided by the consumer.
</p>
<p>
Frequently a consumer may be forwarded to an application hosted directly by the party operating the
service applied for, in these instances ME Expert is to be a Data Processor, and any data provided
to ME Expert from this party will only be used for the purposes explicitly stated at the time of
application for their service.
</p>
<h3>Personal Data disclosure outside of the UK</h3>
<p>
ME Expert may at times transfer your Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).
We will only do so when we have utilised means to ensure the level of data protection is equivalent
to the level afforded in the UK by law, for example when transferred by use of a data-transfer
agreement incorporating standard model protection clauses and ensuring that the party receiving the
Personal Data has sufficient security processes in place.
</p>
<h3>Helping with your Insurance quotation</h3>
<p>
By submitting an insurance quotation through our website, you are asked to explicitly agree that
the top 3 Insurance providers and/or brokerages in your search results may contact you by telephone
for a limited time following the submission of your enquiry. This allows the insurance provider and/or
brokerages to enquire as to whether you would like to proceed with the quotation, and also allows them,
where applicable, to see if they are able to present you with any special offers, further discounts
or incentives relating to the quotation you received.
</p>
<p>You should also be aware that some quotes may be completed on a third-party website, in these
instances your information would be input directly into their systems, and it is your responsibility
to review their privacy policy and / or their terms of service.
</p>
<h3>Call monitoring</h3>
<p>Phone calls to ME Expert may be recorded for training and monitoring purposes, or for the formation
of a verbal contract with which a service may be performed. The required consent for this purpose
will be obtained in an explicit manner, and the information captured in such a recording may be
processed only for the reasons stated.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Credit reference searches</h3>
<p>Please note that we or our business partners may make, or cause searches to be made, at a credit
reference agency, or agencies. You should be aware that such searches may be shown in any other
searches that are made in connection with credit applications made by yourself or other members of
your household. The disclosure of multiple searches may affect your credit profile and your ability
to obtain credit.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Your rights to your Personal Data</h3>
<p>
You have the right to know what Personal Data we hold about you, to whom it has been disclosed, to
correct any information which may be incorrect, and to be forgotten, you are under no contractual
obligation to complete any service application on the ME Expert or Simply Switch website.
</p>
<p>
Please write to the address above, confirming that you are making a request for your Personal Data
under the General Data Protection Regulation, or simply email Privacy@MoneyExpert.com.
</p>
<p>
ME Expert aims to comply with requests for access to Personal Data as quickly as possible,
but within 30 days. Please understand that this request is regularly formed at no cost to yourself;
however, should the request manifest unfounded or excessive ME Expert Ltd may charge a reasonable
fee. You also acknowledge that ME Expert Ltd retains the right to refuse such a request as dictated
solely within the body of the General Data Protection Regulation. This data will be erased or
delivered to you as per your request, and to the minimum standard dictated by law, a copy of the
Data Subject Access Request will be stored in a registry, and held for a minimum of 5 years from
the date on which the request is submitted, you may also object the processing of Personal Data on
a number of levels including direct marketing and market profiling.
</p>
<h3>Automated decision making</h3>
<p>
Please be aware that automated decision-making processes may be utilised to better present options
when you request a quote for services, this is done to eliminate incompatible services and stream
line the process, it is done without bias, and is meant to assist customers in their decision making only.
</p>
<p>
If any information we hold is inaccurate, we will make the necessary amendments and confirm to you
have that these have been made.</p>
