<strong>Collection of Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
In general, we may collect personal information from recipients of our marketing campaigns and visitors to our Web site when they voluntarily provide it to us by (1) completing our registration form, (2) electing to use one of our services, or (3) contacting us (including our webmaster, customer service representatives, or other employees) by email or phone. As part of these activities, we may ask individuals to provide us with information including, but not limited to, name, physical address, email address, telephone number, and demographic information.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As part of the standard operation of our Web site and the web pages that you access via hyperlinks in our online marketing campaigns ("Other Web Pages"), we may collect certain non-personal information from visitors including, but not limited to, their browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed the site. In addition, we may collect information about visitors' browsing behaviour, such as the date and time they visit our Web site or Other Web Pages, the areas or pages of our Web site and Other Web Pages that they visit, the amount of time spent viewing our Web site and Other Web Pages, the number of times the visitor returns to our Web site and Other Web Pages, and other click-stream data. We may use cookies (small text files that are stored on the hard drives of visitors computers when they access our Web site) to collect this information, which may be combined with visitors' personal information. We may also use cookies for other purposes, including, but not limited to, retrieving information previously provided by recipients of our marketing campaigns and visitors to our Web site and remembering the passwords of visitors' to our Web Site and Other Web pages.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We do not share, sell, rent, or trade personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes. We may also allow unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to visitors of our Web site and these cookies may collect consumers' personal information. Visitors to our Web site are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our Web site. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from their hard drives.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
We may use information collected from recipients of our marketing campaigns, visitors to our Web site, and our marketing partners, advertisers, and other third parties for any of the following purposes in either the online or offline arena to send individuals information from our company and to deliver targeted display advertisements and offers through online marketing communications, such as emails, banner advertisements, and pop-up advertisements (by matching criteria provided by our advertisers with information collected from our visitors); to contact visitors to our Web site or registered members of our marketing campaigns when necessary; to help address problems with our Web site or marketing services; to administer our Web site; to conduct internal reviews of our Web site (e.g., to determine the number of visitors to specific pages within the site); to help us better understand recipients of our marketing campaigns and visitors' use of our Web site; and to protect the security or integrity of our Web site and other web pages that are accessible through our online marketing campaigns. Non-personal information will be used for these purposes as well as for conducting internal reviews and monitoring of our web site and other web pages that are accessible through our online marketing campaigns and providing a greater online experience for our visitors.&nbsp;<br>

Accordingly, we recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on any web site that you may access through our Web site.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Unforeseen Circumstances</strong>&nbsp;<br>
In the event that Money4Gold or any of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information acquired by us may be one of the assets transferred.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Changes To This Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp;<br>
There may be times when we need to amend, modify, remove, or change various aspects of this Privacy Policy, and we reserve the right to do so at our discretion.
