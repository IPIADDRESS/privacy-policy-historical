					<h2>privacy policy</h2>
					<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we 
					provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the 
					choices you can make about the way your information is collected and 
					used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our 
					homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information 
					may be requested.</p>
					<h3>the information we collect:</h3>
					<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the 
					Mongoose website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, 
					and register to receive materials. The types of personal information 
					collected at these pages are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Address</li>
						<li>E-mail address</li>
						<li>Phone number</li>
					</ul>
					<p>On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For 
					example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the 
					recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this 
					circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Address</li>
						<li>E-mail address</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>the way we use information:</h3>
					<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an 
					order only to complete that order. We do not share this information 
					with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that 
					order.</p>
					<p>We use the information you provide about someone else when placing 
					an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not 
					share this information with outside parties except to the extent 
					necessary to complete that order.</p>
					<p>We offer gift-cards and wish-lists by which you can personalize a 
					product you order for another person. Information you provide to us to 
					create a gift-card or wish-list is only used for that purpose, and it 
					is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.</p>
					<p>We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such 
					addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with 
					outside parties.</p>
					<p>You can register with our website if you would like to receive our 
					catalog as well as updates on our news and new products. Information you 
					submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill 
					out the registration form and agree to receive this information.</p>
					<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design 
					our website and to share with our distributors. For example, we may 
					tell a distributor that X number of individuals visited a certain area 
					on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out 
					our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be 
					used to identify those individuals.</p>
					<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable 
					information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described 
					above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise 
					prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
					<h3>our commitment to data security</h3>
					<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure 
					the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, 
					electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the 
					information we collect online.</p>
					<h3>how you can access or correct your information</h3>
					<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we 
					collect online and maintain by our Registration and Orders Pages. We 
					use this procedure to better safeguard your information.</p>
					<p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable 
					information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.</p>
					<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable 
					steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
					<h3>how to contact us</h3>
					<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy 
					policies, please call us at <em>[phone number]</em> or send us an e-mail 
					at <em>[e-mail address]</em>.</p>
