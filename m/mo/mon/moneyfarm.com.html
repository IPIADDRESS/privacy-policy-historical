<p>MoneyFarm’s products and services are not designed to appeal to or not available for persons under the age of 18. &nbsp;Therefore, MoneyFarm does not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from anyone under the age of 18.</p>
<p><strong>What information does MoneyFarm collect and what does MoneyFarm do with this information?</strong></p>
<p>MoneyFarm may collect the following information about website users:</p>

</ul>
<p>MoneyFarm, and any third parties which host or maintain this website for us, may need to collect information about you and your computer to allow you to use some services. The information will be collected when you register or log on to the website or when you choose to use an available MoneyFarm service via the website. This includes, but is not limited to, when you fill out forms, transfer any policies into our agency, upload any documentation, send MoneyFarm any communication by email, fax or post, make an enquiry, complete the MoneyFarm risk profiling questionnaire or any other communication that MoneyFarm receives directly or indirectly from you.</p>
<p>The nature of MoneyFarm’s business is such that MoneyFarm may on occasion ask you to provide sensitive personal data as defined in the Data Protection Act 1998.&nbsp; Where MoneyFarm does so, MoneyFarm will request your explicit consent for the use of such sensitive personal data.</p>
<p>We may carry out fraud prevention checks using fraud prevention databases. If false or inaccurate information is provided, and/or fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. &nbsp;We may access and use the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies from other countries.</p>
<p>MoneyFarm, or third parties providing services on MoneyFarm’s behalf, may also monitor traffic patterns and usage of the website to help to improve the website design and lay-out.</p>
<p>Any communications made via phone, Skype or the website chat function will also be recorded and stored securely.</p>
<p>In order to carry out your instructions, MoneyFarm may also pre-populate the forms of third party websites with the personal data you have supplied us with. This may be done manually or through secure and encrypted data transfers. It is your responsibility to check that the pre-populated data fields are correct. MoneyFarm bears no responsibility for any problems with any applications to third-party companies that arise from any errors or inaccuracies in pre-populated data fields on application forms which we complete on your behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

If, at any time, you would rather not receive such information, please contact MoneyFarm in writing, either by post or email (to hello@moneyfarm.com) to let us know.</p>
<p>If you ask not to receive such news, MoneyFarm will still need to keep your personal data so that you can continue to use the website and so that MoneyFarm can deal with the administration and security of the website. MoneyFarm will still contact you by email or post for anything necessary for the administration of your membership and to comply with any legal or other important conditions; however, MoneyFarm will not then email you or contact you by telephone, fax or post for promotional purposes without your subsequent consent.</p>
<p>From time-to-time MoneyFarm may request information from users for the purposes of running contests or competitions. Participation in these contests or competitions is completely voluntary and you therefore can choose whether or not to disclose this information for this purpose</p>
<p><strong>Sharing of information with third parties</strong></p>
<p>MoneyFarm will not disclose your personal data to third parties other than as described in this section unless it is otherwise legally permitted or required to do so.</p>
<p>MoneyFarm may need to pass your information to third party service providers which maintain, administer or develop the website on our behalf and the information will only be provided for such limited purposes. In addition, MoneyFarm may provide aggregate statistics about its customers, sales, traffic patterns and related website information to reputable third-parties, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal data to third parties&nbsp;for promotional purposes.</p>
<p>MoneyFarm reserves the right to access and disclose personal data or information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate its systems properly, or to protect itself or its users.</p>
<p><strong>Your consent</strong></p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that by registering or using this website and any services offered via this website, certain information relating to you will be captured electronically (including sensitive personal data where required, but this will be subject to you giving your explicit consent in such cases) or otherwise and transmitted to MoneyFarm and / or, to third parties which maintain, administer or develop the website, as set out in the section above.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that MoneyFarm may send your information outside of the European Economic Area for processing or use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

<p>By using this website, you expressly agree to the collection and use of your information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>How does MoneyFarm protect user information?</strong></p>
