     <p>This privacy policy applies  to 'the Money Advice Service'. This includes our telephone Money Advice Line, face-to-face  appointment service and the Money Advice Service website. </p>
     <p><strong>We took over responsibility for the Moneymadeclear service from the Financial Services Authority (FSA) on 26 April 2010. If you provided the FSA with personal information before this date please see ‘Transfer of the Moneymadeclear service’ below to find out how this affects you.</strong></p>
  <p>This policy together with our  website <a href="/termsandconditions.aspx">terms and conditions</a> sets out the basis  on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide us with,  will be processed by us or our delivery partners.</p>
     <p>       Any information you provide will  be treated in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. We won’t try to  sell you anything and you won’t receive unsolicited telephone calls or mail  from us or any third parties as a result of personal data being provided to us.  Your information will only be used for quality, training and evaluation  purposes, to help us monitor and improve the Money Advice Service, or to  provide services you have requested (such as an order for printed publications,  or a telephone or face-to-face appointment). By using the Money Advice Service  website and submitting your information to us, you agree to us using your  personal information in accordance with this policy.</p>
  <p>Please notify us by email to <a href="mailto:enquiries@moneyadviceservice.or.uk">enquiries@moneyadviceservice.or.uk</a> if you have provided us with personal information and you do not wish it to be  used as described below, or you wish to see which information we hold about you  as a result of your contact with us.

     <h2>What information are we collecting?</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>If you talk to us face to face or on the phone</strong> <br>
        We may ask for personal information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number or date of birth.<br><br></li>
        <li><strong>If you use the Money Advice Service website</strong> <br>
          We log your IP (Internet Protocol) address and session information  (such as the duration of the visit and the type of browser used).&nbsp; Subject to legal requirements from time to  time, we may also obtain information about your general internet usage by using  a cookie file.&nbsp; Cookies are small text  files that are often created when you visit a website, and which are stored in  the cookie directory of your computer.&nbsp; A  cookie may be created when you visit us.&nbsp;  <br>
          <br>
          We may use both permanent and session cookies.&nbsp; The permanent cookie stores a random number  on your computer to help us count the number of times users return to our  website.&nbsp; The session cookie lets us know  which pages within our site you visit.&nbsp;  Permanent cookies do not expire when you leave our website and may be  used on subsequent visits to the website.&nbsp;  Session cookies expire when you leave the website or switch off your  computer.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          The cookie (whether permanent  or session) does not contain any personal information about you, and it cannot  be used to identify an individual user.&nbsp;  You can set your browser not to accept cookies.&nbsp; You should read the information that came  with your browser software to see how you can turn off the automatic download  feature, should you so wish. <br>
       <br>
       We sometimes collect personal information through optional online surveys from  some areas of our website. These are usually delivered by other companies, so a  different privacy policy will apply.&nbsp; We  rely on these third parties to obtain your consent for us to use this  information. Additional information about the survey will be available to see  before you decide whether or not to take part. <br>
  <br>
       You may also provide us with your address or contact details to receive further  information or guidance, receive printed material (such as Money Advice Service  printed guides) or to ask that we call you back by telephone. This is collected  using online forms. </li>
     </ul>
<hr>
     <h2>What will we do with this information?</h2>
     <p></p>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>If you talk to us face to face or on the phone</strong><br>
          We will use your personal information to provide you with any  information or advice that you ask for,&nbsp;  to reply to any correspondence and to manage the service that we provide.  We will also use it to analyse information such as where in the country users  come from, what type of questions they are asking, and whether we were able to  give them information or advice that was useful. We also want to hear users’  views on the Money Advice Service and any improvements they might suggest. If  this is something you agree to help us with, then we would need to pass on your  contact details to the independent research agency commissioned by us so that  they can get in touch with you. Neither we nor our appointed agency will try to  sell you anything.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>If you use the Money Advice Service website</strong> <br>
        Subject to legal  requirements in place from time to time, your IP address and session  information are only used for system administration and to provide statistics,  which we use to evaluate use of the site.&nbsp;  For information about the services we use to collect anonymous site  usage statistics, please visit the Nielsen Online, Google Analytics and  Doubleclick websites – see Related links. <br><br> If you provide us with your contact or address details using one of our online forms we will only use this information to deliver the services you have requested.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>If we would like to use your personal information for any other purpose than those stated above, we will contact you to ask for your consent before doing so.</p>
     <hr>
     <h2>Who will see this information?</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>If you talk to us face to face or on the phone</strong> <br>
        All personal information  will be fully protected in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and  will be kept strictly confidential. The only people with access to it will be  those involved in providing, evaluating or managing the Money Advice Service.  This policy does not cover any other service that we may refer you to in order  to complete your enquiry.<br><br></li>
        <li><strong>If you use the Money Advice Service website</strong> <br>For information about the services we use to collect anonymous site usage statistics, please visit the Nielsen Online, Google Analytics and Doubleclick websites – see Related links. <br><br>
        If you asked us to call you  back or requested printed material (such as a Money Advice Service guide or the  Parent’s guide to money), we use third parties to provide these services, so  your information will be passed on to them for this purpose only. They will not  pass your information on to anyone else or use it for any other purpose.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>We may pass  on your personal information if we are under a duty to disclose or share your  personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation or in order  to enforce or apply our website terms and conditions or for the purposes of the  prevention or detection of a crime.</p>
<hr>
     <h2>How do we protect your personal information?</h2>
     <p>The Money Advice Service makes every effort (through  physical, organisational and technological measures) to ensure that your personal  information is held securely and to safeguard against unauthorised access to  your personal information.&nbsp; Unfortunately,  no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We  strive to protect your personal information after we’ve received it, however  you acknowledge that the privacy of your communications and personal  information can never be completely guaranteed when it is being transmitted.</p>
     <hr>
     <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
     <p>Please note that this &nbsp;policy may change from time to time and the  new privacy policy will be published on the Money Advice Service&nbsp; website.&nbsp;  Regularly reviewing this page ensures you are always aware of what  information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we  will share it with other parties.</p>
     <hr>
     <h2>Transfer of the Moneymadeclear service </h2>
  <p><strong>The  Money Advice Service was launched on 4 April 2011.&nbsp; Before this date, the service operated as  Moneymadeclear from the Consumer Financial Education Body (CFEB).</strong></p>
  <p>The Financial Services Act 2010  ('the Act') received Royal Assent on 8 April 2010. The Act made amendments to  the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. These amendments required the FSA  to establish the Consumer Financial Education Body (CFEB) and they also  transferred responsibility for the Moneymadeclear service to CFEB on 26 April  2010.</p>
  <p>To enable CFEB to continue  providing the Moneymadeclear service, the FSA forwarded all personal  information collected through it on this date to CFEB. With the launch of the  Money Advice Service on 4 April 2011, this data was transferred to us on that  date.&nbsp; As explained above in this privacy  policy, we won’t try to sell you anything and you won’t receive unsolicited  telephone calls or mail from the &nbsp;FSA or  any third parties. We will only use your information as outlined in this policy.</p>
  <p>If you previously shared personal information  with the FSA (which may include your home address, email address and telephone  number) while using the Moneymadeclear service, and you do not wish us to hold  it, let us know by email to <a href="mailto:enquiries@moneyadviceservice.org.uk">enquiries@moneyadviceservice.org.uk</a>.
