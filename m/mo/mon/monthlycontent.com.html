        <p class="style4" align="left">Your  privacy is important to us.
 To better protect your privacy we provide  this notice explaining our 
online information practices and the choices  you can make about the way
 your information is collected and used. To  make this notice easy to 
find, we make it available on our homepage and  at every point where 
personally identifiable information may be  requested. </p>

        <p class="style4" align="left"><a name="2"></a><strong>The Information We Collect:</strong> </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">This  notice applies to all 
information collected or submitted on MonthlyContent.com and any related site. On some pages, you can order 
products, make  requests, and register to receive materials. The types 
of personal  information collected at these pages are: </p>
        <div class="style4" align="left">
          <ul>
            Name <br>
            Address <br>

            Email address <br>
            Phone number <br>
            Credit/Debit Card Information <br>
            (etc.)
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="style4" align="left">On  some pages, you can submit 
information about other people. For example,  if you order a gift online
 and want it sent directly to the recipient,  you will need to submit 
the recipient's address. In this circumstance,  the types of personal 
information collected are: </p>

        <div class="style4" align="left">
          <ul>
            Name <br>
            Address <br>
            Phone Number <br>
            (etc.)
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="style4" align="left"><a name="3"></a><strong>The Way We Use Information:</strong> </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">We  use the information you 
provide about yourself when placing an order  only to complete that 
order. We do not share this information with  outside parties except to 
the extent necessary to complete that order. </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">If we offer gift-cards by which 
you can personalize a  product you order for another person. Information
 you provide to us to  create a gift-card is only used for that purpose,
 and it is only  disclosed to the person receiving the gift. </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">We use return email addresses to 
answer the email we  receive. Such addresses are not used for any other 
purpose and are not  shared with outside parties. </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">You can register with our website
 if you would like to  receive our catalog as well as updates on our new
 products and  services. Information you submit on our website will not 
be used for  this purpose unless you fill out the registration form. </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">We use non-identifying and 
aggregate information to  better design our website and to share with 
advertisers. For example,  we may tell an advertiser that X number of 
individuals visited a  certain area on our website, or that Y number of 
men and Z number of  women filled out our registration form, but we 
would not disclose  anything that could be used to identify those 
individuals. </p>

        <p class="style4" align="left">Finally, we never use or share 
the personally  identifiable information provided to us online in ways 
unrelated to the  ones described above without also providing you an 
opportunity to  opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left"><a name="4"></a><strong>Our Commitment To Data Security</strong> </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">To  prevent unauthorized access, 
maintain data accuracy, and ensure the  correct use of information, we 
have put in place appropriate physical,  electronic, and managerial 
procedures to safeguard and secure the  information we collect online. </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left"><a name="5"></a><strong>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</strong> </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">Protecting  the privacy of the 
very young is especially important. For that reason,  we never collect 
or maintain information at our website from those we  actually know are 
under 13, and no part of our website is structured to  attract anyone 
under 13. </p>

        <p class="style4" align="left"><a name="6"></a><strong>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</strong> </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">You  can access all your 
personally identifiable information that we collect  online and maintain
 by contacting customer support at: http://www.GetHelpRightNow.com<br>
          <br>
          We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. </p>
        <p class="style4" align="left">To  protect your privacy and 
security, we will also take reasonable steps  to verify your identity 
before granting access or making corrections. </p>
