        Furthermore under the EMR the FCA has a legal duty to co-operate and exchange information with other government and regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom and
        internationally. If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation, we will only disclose to the extent

      </ul>
      <h3>5. Where we store your personal data</h3>
      <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff
      operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your
      payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably
      necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen)
      a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot
      guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures
      and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
      <h3>6. Your rights</h3>
      <p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data)
      if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to
      prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at hello@monese.com.</p>
      <p>Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites,
      please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.
      Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
      <h3>7. Access to information</h3>
      <p>The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act.
      Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you. </p>
      <h3>8. Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.
      Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.</p>
