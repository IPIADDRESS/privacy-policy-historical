                <h3>Information Which We May Collect</h3>
                <p>To register to use our service you will have to supply us with personal information.&nbsp; “Personal Information” means information that identifies you.&nbsp; The personal information we collect to register you is your name and e-mail address. You will also need to choose a username and secure word. You may also optionally provide your address and date of birth within your online profile. If you send an email to a friend about our site, we may collect their email address from you. You do not have to supply any information simply to visit the site.</p>
                <p>Once you have aggregated accounts (see “Other people who have to be able to access your information” below for an explanation) with us, we will have access to that account information.</p>
                <p>We keep track of the internet addresses from which Users visit us, and track the page(s) on our site that you visit. We analyse this data for trends and statistics.&nbsp; Please see “Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies”</p>
                <h3>How we might use your information</h3>
                <p>We will use the personal information which we collect for the purposes of registering you as a User of our services, correspondence, or participating in online surveys to help us enhance our services and products for you, and to send a one-time email to your friends about our site upon your request.</p>

                <p>In addition we will use your personal information and information from your account aggregation for the purposes of analysing it and making suggestions which may enable you to make savings or consider alternative or additional products to the ones which you are using. These suggestions can be delivered either in the service or by way of email or text messages to you.</p>

                <h3>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
                <p>We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information</p>
                <p>We use another company to place cookies on your computer to collect non-personally identifiable information to compile aggregated statistics for us about visitors to our site.&nbsp; </p>
                <h3>Other people who have to be able to access your information</h3>
                <p>We use a company called Yodlee Inc. (<a href="http://www.yodlee.com/">www.yodlee.com</a>) to provide software that lets you add details of the accounts which you want to include in the service (“account aggregation”). When you aggregate an account Yodlee collects and stores securely your log in details, such as User name and password. This information is never disclosed to us and is subject to Yodlee’s privacy policy.&nbsp; For further information on how Yodlee keeps your information secure please visit <a href="http://www.yodlee.com/security_se.shtml">http://www.yodlee.com/security_se.shtml</a></p>
