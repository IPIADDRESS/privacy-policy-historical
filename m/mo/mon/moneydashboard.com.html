<h3>Information Which We May Collect</h3>
<p>You do not have to supply any information simply to visit the site.</p>
<p>To register to use our service you will have to supply us with personal information. “Personal Information” means information that identifies you. The personal information we collect to register you is your e-mail address. In order to add your financial accounts, you will also need to provide your UK postcode and date of birth, and choose a secure question and answer. Once you have aggregated accounts with us (see “Other people who have to be able to access your information” below for an explanation) , we will have access to that account information.</p>
<p>We keep track of the internet addresses from which Users visit us, and track the page(s) on our site that you visit. We analyse this data for trends and statistics. Please see “Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How we use your information</h3>
<p>We will use the personal information which we collect for the purposes of registering you as a User of our services, correspondence, or participating in online surveys to help us enhance our services and products for you, and to send a one-time email to your friends about our site upon your request.</p>
<p>We also ask for personal information at the point at which you add a financial account to enable us to ask security related questions if you later ask us to reset your password.</p>
<p>In addition, through a computer system-run process, we will use your personal information and information from your account aggregation for the purposes of analysing it and making suggestions which may enable you to make savings or consider alternative or additional products to the ones which you are using. These suggestions can be delivered either in the service or by way of email or text messages to you. This may involve us sending limited details about you (which will not identify you) to our partners so that we can tailor suggested products for you more accurately.</p>
<p>Any information we collect is used to improve the content of the site, enhance Users' experiences when visiting our site, and customise the content and/or layout of our pages.</p>
<p>We also use personal information in performing statistical analysis of Users’ behaviour as a whole; and to help in the creation of anonymised statistical data which we may use at our discretion (including licensing to third parties).</p>
<p>We do not share personal information for any reason that is not disclosed in this Policy or apparent to you at the time the information is requested and we do not sell or rent any personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other people who have to be able to access your information</h3>
<p>We use a company called Yodlee Inc. (www.yodlee.com) to provide software that lets you add details of the accounts which you want to include in the service (“account aggregation”). When you aggregate an account Yodlee collects and securely stores your log in details, such as User name and password. This information is never stored by us nor subsequently disclosed to us and is subject to Yodlee’s privacy policy. For further information on how Yodlee keeps your information secure please visit <a href="http://yodlee.com/yodlee-security/.">http://yodlee.com/yodlee-security/</a>. Yodlee are headquartered in the USA. They have provided account aggregation to top UK &amp; USA financial institutions for more than 10 years. We have a contract with Yodlee which requires them to be bound by our privacy policy and to meet the requirements of the Data Protection Act in just the same way as it applies to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The information we may give to or share with somebody else</h3>
<p>We may have to disclose your personal information, if required by law to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or similar legal requirement.</p>
<p>We may share your personal information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>to companies that provide services to help us operate the application and communicate with users. These companies are authorised to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us;</li>
<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, or investigate fraud;</li>
<li>if Money Dashboard is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information;</li>
