                  <h2>Privacy Statement</h2>

<div class="inner_padding">
<p class="head">Overview

</p><p>Monster is committed to
respecting the privacy of our users. We strive to provide a safe, secure user
experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth the online data collection and
usage policies and practices that apply to all of our Web sites (unless a
different privacy statement is specifically made applicable). By using a
Monster Web site, you consent to the policies and practices described in this
Statement.</p>

<p>
Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United
States. If you access a Monster Web site outside the United States, your usage
of that site constitutes consent to the transfer of your data out of your
country and to the United States.</p>

<p>
Our sites contain links to other Web sites over which we have no control.
Monster is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other Web
sites to which you choose to link from a Monster Web site. We encourage you to
review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can understand how
they collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Statement applies
solely to the information we collect on a Monster Web site, and does not apply
to information we collect in any other fashion.</p>



<p class="head">Collection and
Retention of Information


</p><p>
In some areas of our Web sites, Monster requests or may request that you
provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address,
telephone number credit card number, social security number, contact
information, billing information and any other information from which your
identity is discernible. In other areas, Monster collects or may collect
demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age,
preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes we collect or may
collect a combination of the two types of information. Examples of areas on
Monster Web sites where we collect personal or combined personal and
demographic data are pages where you can open a MyMonster account, sign up to
use a service, post a resume, enter a contest or purchase a product <br>
<br>
In addition, Monster may indirectly collect information about you when you use
certain third party services on our Web site. For example, if you register on
our site by using your Microsoft Passport user name and password, you authorize
us to have access to and store the information in your Passport account
profile; such information will be subject to, and treated in accordance with,
the policies and practices described in this Statement. <br>
<br>
We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of our site,
such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is
information about your computer hardware and software that is or may be
collected by Monster. This information can include without limitation your IP
address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site
addresses. <br>
<br>
Monster may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive,
cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style information about
yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If
you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that
information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this
Statement. For example, such information may be used for the purpose of
determining your potential interest in receiving email or other communications
about particular products or services. <br>
<br>
Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public
areas of Monster, such as in online forums or chat rooms, such information may
be collected and used by others over whom Monster has no control. We are not
responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or
otherwise make available in public areas of Monster. <br>
<br>
Since we believe that managing your career is a life-long process, we retain
indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an effort to make your
repeat use with us more efficient, practical, and relevant. Of course, you can
correct or update your MyMonster account profile and resume at any time.
Moreover, you can delete your resume from our online database or close your
MyMonster account at any time, in which event we will remove all our copies of
your resume and MyMonster account profile information except for an archival
copy which is not accessible on the Internet. </p>

<p class="head">Use of Information by Monster</p>

<p>We use the information we
gather on a Monster Web site, whether personal, demographic, collective or
technical, for the purpose of operating and improving the Monster Web site,
fostering a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services
that we offer. <br>
<br>
We may also use the information we gather to inform you of other products or
services available from Monster or its affiliated companies or to contact you
about your opinion of current products and services or potential new products
and services that may be offered. (The term "affiliated companies" is
defined in the section of this Statement entitled "Contact
Information.") <br>
<br>
We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other
communications regarding updates at the Monster site, such as new Monster
opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you. The
nature and frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information
we have about you. In addition, at the time of registration for MyMonster, you
have the option to elect to receive additional communications, information and
promotions including without limitation free informational newsletters from
Monster relating to topics that may be of special interest to you, such as
career management advice. <br>
<br>
We have an area where you can submit feedback. Any feedback you submit in this
area becomes our property, and we can use such feedback (such as success
stories) for marketing purposes or contact you for further information. </p>

<p class="head">Disclosure of Information to Others</p>




<p>
We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, combined personal
and demographic information or information about your use of a Monster Web site
(such as the areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth
in the following four subparagraphs. </p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may disclose such information to
     third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you
     indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or
     services of third parties at the time you register for a MyMonster
     account, we may supply your contact information to third parties such as
     employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for the
     purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We may
     use data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have
     expressed) to determine whether you might be interested in the products or
     services of a particular third-party </li><br><br>
 <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may disclose such information to
     companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf.
     Examples may include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing
     marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing
     customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your
     personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may
     not share that information with any other third party. </li><br><br>
 <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may disclose such information if
     legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity
     or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a)
     conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect
     the rights or property of Monster or its affiliated companies; (c) prevent
     a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety
     of users or the public. </li><br><br>
 <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may disclose and transfer such
     information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of
     Monster's business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger,
     consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets.
     In addition, in the event Monster becomes the subject of a bankruptcy
     proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Monster or its trustee in
     bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a
     transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. </li><br><br>
</ol>

<p><br>
<br>
Monster may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to each
of its Web sites (for example, the number of visitors to Monster's Diversity
area) with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they may
understand the kinds of visitors to Monster's site and how those visitors use
the site. <br>
<br>
Monster supplies technology, hosting and related services to other leading
companies to power recruitment areas on their Web sites (sometimes referred to
as "private label recruitment areas"). Personal and/or demographic
information supplied by you in private label recruitment areas becomes part of
the Monster database, but it is not accessible by anyone other than you,
Monster and the company concerned without your consent. <br>
<br>
Information gathered on a page in a private label recruitment area, or on a
co-branded page (such as that of a contest co-sponsored by Monster and another
company), may become the property of the other company or of both Monster and
the other company. In that instance, the use of such information by the other
company may be subject to the privacy policy of that company and, in any event,
Monster is not responsible for that company's use of your personal or
demographic information. </p>



<p>If you
apply for a position through a co-branded site, you may be asked to provide
information on your age, gender or race. 
Some employers are required by law to gather this information from job
applicants for reporting and record keeping requirements. You should understand that if provided, this
information will be used by employers only in accordance with applicable law
and will not be used in making any employment decisions. All information provided will be kept
separate from your expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information is strictly
voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you
choose not to provide this information.</p>



<p class="head">Resumes</p>

<p>Since Monster is a career site, we give you the option of
putting your resume in our database. There are two ways of doing this: </p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li>can store your resume in our database, but not allow
     it to be searchable by potential employers. Not allowing your resume to be
     searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but
     employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume
     database product. </li><br><br>
 <li>If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all
     parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof)
     will have access to your resume. </li><br><br>
</ol>

<p>We
attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof)
only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human
resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security
agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this
database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties
who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may
remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However,
employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database or
to obtain a copy of that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained
access to the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own
files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of
resumes in these instances. </p>



<p class="head">Use of Cookies</p>

<p>Monster uses "cookies" to help personalize and
maximize your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text file that
is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run
programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued
the cookie to you.

<br>
<br>
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to
save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have
returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Monster pages, or
register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information
(such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies,
we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site
experience. When you return to the Monster site, the information you previously
provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you
customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing. <br>
<br>
You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting
to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify
your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit
you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to
decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact
your experience on the Monster Web site. </p>



<p class="head">Use of Web Beacons</p>

<p>Monster Web pages may contain electronic images known as
Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who
have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are
not used to access your personally identifiable information on Monster; they
are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Web site
usage <br>
<br>
Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie
number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which
the Web beacon resides. </p>



<p class="head">Updating Your Information</p>

<p>You may review, correct, update or change your MyMonster
account profile information at any time. Simply log into your MyMonster
account, go to your Account Profile, review your account information and, if
you wish, edit it with the options provided. <a href="http://my.monster.com/updateacct.asp">Click here</a> to access your
Account Profile page. <br>
<br>
If you opted to receive newsletters, commercial e-mails or other communications
from Monster or third parties at the time you registered with MyMonster, but
subsequently change your mind, you may opt-out by editing your Account Profile
as described above. If you previously opted not to receive such communications,
you may later opt-in by editing your Account Profile. . </p>



<p class="head">Security</p>

<p>Monster has implemented reasonable technical and
organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from
accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.
However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able
to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.
<br>
<br>
When you place an order online at Monster, your credit card information is
protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer
("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card
information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. Monster uses a
service company to process its credit card transactions. For further
information on this company's privacy and security practices, please <a href="http://www.verisign.com/truste/index.html">click here</a>. </p>



<p class="head">Children</p>

<p>Monster is not intended for children under 13 years of
age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. </p>



<p class="head">Changes to Privacy Statement</p>

<p>If we decide to change
our Privacy Statement for Monster, we will post those changes here so that you
will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information,
and to whom we will disclose it. If at any time, you have questions or concerns
about Monster's Privacy Statement, please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:notification@Monster.com">notification@Monster.com</a>
or call us at 1-800-MONSTER and speak to one of our representatives. </p>
