PRIVACY POLICY OF The Site and all related Websites.
<br><br>
Effective Date: July 1, 2013
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting the privacy policy page of MoneyTips.com ("The Site"). We take privacy seriously, and want you to feel comfortable using The Site.  This page describes our online privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").  This Privacy Policy is designed to protect consumers to ensure you both have a valuable and great experience on our The Site with confidence that your information is safe and secure.
<br><br>

By requesting information on our products and services, providing information to us, or otherwise using The Site in any way, you are further indicating your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. 
<br><br>
<ol>
<li> <strong>Collection of Information</strong>
The Site collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to the list herein, which is inclusive of online or offline methods. (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including The site and other websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means) . In these methods, The Site may ask an individual to provide various information, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, user behavior, other demographic information and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Personal Information"). Providing information is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Personal Information to the Site.  
<br><br>
The personal profile information you submit to The Site remains your property, but by submitting that information to The Site, you grant The Site and its Affiliates, the right to use that information for marketing purposes.  The Site may also use such information for content improvement and feedback purposes.  The Site reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event The Site believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of its Terms of Use and/or the Community Guidelines and/or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if The Site is sold or acquired, or when The Site deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when The Site, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.
<br><br>
a. Information Collected from You
<br><br>
a.i. Survey Information.  Survey information is for the purposes of providing data to The Site to represent to its customers and to assist The Site in improving its experience for its customers.
<br><br>
a.ii. Quote Information.  Quote information is for the purposes of providing consumers with quotes for services from service providers including but not limited to various mortgage loans, insurance products, credit card offers and other service offerings.
<br><br>
a.iii. The Site Membership or Registration. To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from The Site, this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from The Site and its partners, whether at The Site or otherwise. 
<br><br>
a.iv. "Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for The Site's services, via registration at our website. The Site collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use. 
<br><br>
a.v. Requests for Assistance or Service. When an individual requests assistance through The Site’s customer service department, and when an individual voluntarily subscribes to The Site's service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").
<br><br>
b. Automated collection of information. The Site currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, The Site may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
<br><br>
b.i. Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows The Site to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in The Site 's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use The Site need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of The Site.
<br><br>
b.ii. Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows The Site to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, The Site might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where shoes are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in The Site's database, visits the shoe website,  The Site receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the shoe website, and The Site would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in shoes.  The Site may thereafter present offers of shoe-related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on its and its affiliates web pages,  The Site also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in The Site's database.
<br><br>
b.iii. New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is The Site's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, The Site strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
<br><br>
b.iv. Usage Tracking and Log Files.  The Site tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites. Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.
<br><br>
b.v. IP Address. We collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, to gather information on your proximity to improve your experience using The Site and to administer The Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.
<br><br>
b.vi. Clear GIFs. We use a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on The Site and in e-mail communications with users. A Clear GIF or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of The Site. We may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain any personally identifiable information (PII), provide us with important information about how users use The Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on The Site solely to track users who link from their respective websites to The Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user PII.
<br><br>
c. Outside Information.  The Site may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of  The Site including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
<br><br>
d. No Information Collected from Children.  The Site will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If  The Site obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information,  The Site has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.  The Site designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
<br><br>
e. Links to External Websites. The Site's e-mails and websites contain links to external websites. You will be taken to external websites if you click on these links.
