PRIVACY POLICY OF The Site and all related Websites.
<br><br>
Effective Date: July 1, 2013
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting the privacy policy page of MoneyTips.com ("The Site"). We take privacy seriously, and want you to feel comfortable using The Site.  This page describes our online privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").  This Privacy Policy is designed to protect consumers to ensure you both have a valuable and great experience on our The Site with confidence that your information is safe and secure.
<br><br>
By visiting The Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as well as our website Terms of Use. By requesting information on our products and services, providing information to us, or otherwise using The Site in any way, you are further indicating your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. 
<br><br>
<ol>
<li> <strong>Collection of Information</strong>
The Site collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to the list herein, which is inclusive of online or offline methods. (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including The site and other websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means) . In these methods, The Site may ask an individual to provide various information, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, user behavior, other demographic information and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Personal Information"). Providing information is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Personal Information to the Site.  
<br><br>
The personal profile information you submit to The Site remains your property, but by submitting that information to The Site, you grant The Site and its Affiliates, the right to use that information for marketing purposes.  The Site may also use such information for content improvement and feedback purposes.  The Site reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event The Site believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of its Terms of Use and/or the Community Guidelines and/or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if The Site is sold or acquired, or when The Site deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when The Site, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.
<br><br>
a. Information Collected from You
<br><br>
a.i. Survey Information.  Survey information is for the purposes of providing data to The Site to represent to its customers and to assist The Site in improving its experience for its customers.
<br><br>
a.ii. Quote Information.  Quote information is for the purposes of providing consumers with quotes for services from service providers including but not limited to various mortgage loans, insurance products, credit card offers and other service offerings.
<br><br>
a.iii. The Site Membership or Registration. To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from The Site, this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from The Site and its partners, whether at The Site or otherwise. 
<br><br>
a.iv. "Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for The Site's services, via registration at our website. The Site collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use. 
<br><br>
a.v. Requests for Assistance or Service. When an individual requests assistance through The Site’s customer service department, and when an individual voluntarily subscribes to The Site's service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").
<br><br>
b. Automated collection of information. The Site currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, The Site may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
<br><br>
b.i. Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows The Site to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in The Site 's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use The Site need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of The Site.
<br><br>
b.ii. Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows The Site to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, The Site might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where shoes are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in The Site's database, visits the shoe website,  The Site receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the shoe website, and The Site would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in shoes.  The Site may thereafter present offers of shoe-related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on its and its affiliates web pages,  The Site also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in The Site's database.
<br><br>
b.iii. New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is The Site's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, The Site strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
<br><br>
b.iv. Usage Tracking and Log Files.  The Site tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites. Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.
<br><br>
b.v. IP Address. We collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, to gather information on your proximity to improve your experience using The Site and to administer The Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.
<br><br>
b.vi. Clear GIFs. We use a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on The Site and in e-mail communications with users. A Clear GIF or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of The Site. We may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain any personally identifiable information (PII), provide us with important information about how users use The Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on The Site solely to track users who link from their respective websites to The Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user PII.
<br><br>
c. Outside Information.  The Site may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of  The Site including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
<br><br>
d. No Information Collected from Children.  The Site will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If  The Site obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information,  The Site has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.  The Site designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
<br><br>
e. Links to External Websites. The Site's e-mails and websites contain links to external websites. You will be taken to external websites if you click on these links. Your information may be passed from The Site's database to the external website, and/or external database, for your convenience (e.g. your information may be used to pre-fill a form at a destination website).  The Site is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any external website owner. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any website you visit.</li>
<br><br>
<li><strong>Use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</strong>
<br><br>
a. Our use of your information.  
<br><br>
a.i. Email Policy.  The Site uses PII to provide promotional offers by email to individuals.  The Site may maintain separate email lists for different purposes.
<br><br>
a.ii. Content of Email Messages. In certain commercial email messages sent by The Site, an Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to The Site. The "Subject:" line of The Site email messages will usually contain a line provided from the Advertiser to The Site.
<br><br>
a.iii. Solicited Email.  The Site only sends email to individuals who have agreed to receive email from The Site. As such, The Site does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to The Site's email messages.
<br><br>
a.iv. Telemarketing.  The Site uses PII to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.  We may use PII to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content and advertising.  By submitting Survey Information, The Site Membership or Registration or Quote Information request to The Site, you understand that The Site may contact you by telephone (on a recorded line), automated calling, automated call with pre-recorded message to facilitate a verified phone connection, email, or home mail delivery based on the information you provided to The Site in order to process and fulfill your request or offer you other products or services, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call list or the Do Not Call List of The Site or its affiliates. <br><br>  If The Site contacts you and you do not wish to be contacted again by The Site, then you should specifically make a request to The Site to not contact you again.  Please note that The Site may maintain the information you provided whether or not you elect to use its services. 
<br><br>
a.v. Wireless Addresses. If the e-mail address you provide to  The Site is a wireless e-mail address, you agree to receive messages at such address from  The Site or its business associates (unless and until you have elected not to receive such messages by following the instructions in the unsubscribe portion of this policy). You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages.
<br><br>
a.vi. Short Message Service.  The Site may make available a service through which you can receive messages on your wireless device via short message service ("SMS Service"). Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS service may include your name, address, cell phone number, your provider's name, and the date, time, and content of your messages. You represent that you are 18 years of age and the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. In addition to any fee of which you are notified, your provider's standard messaging rates apply to our confirmation and all subsequent SMS correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider.  The Site will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis.  The Site may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of the SMS Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with our SMS Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies.
