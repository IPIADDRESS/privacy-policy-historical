</ul>
<li>Automatic Information:</li>
<ul>
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. mondofacto and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. mondofacto uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyse trends and administer the website.</li>
<li>mondofacto may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes user profile pages.</li>

</ul>
</ol>

<h3>e-mail communications</h3>

<p>mondofacto is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your e-mail address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the "sharing your information" section below. mondofacto may send out e-mails with mondofacto-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions.

However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us.</p>

<h3>cookies</h3>

<ul class="font90">
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. mondofacto cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.</li>

<li>Member Directory: The e-mail address that you submit upon registration will be searchable by other mondofacto users who know you by your email address, unless you choose to opt out of this feature.

<li>If you do not wish to receive e-mail from us or other mondofacto users, please visit the Email Preferences section of your User Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message.</li>
<li>However, please note that you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to have people who know you by your email address find you via the Member Directory service, please visit the Privacy Settings section of your User Profile to opt out of this feature.</li>
<li>As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.</li>
