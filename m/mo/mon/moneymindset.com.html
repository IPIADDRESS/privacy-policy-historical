Additionally, you may opt out of receiving any additional emails or marketing messages from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our email notifications.</p>
<p>Further, if you feel that we have not complied with the relevant data protection regulations, please contact us by sending us an email at support at moneymindset dot com with your first and last name, your country of origin, and a summary of your concern or complaint. We will endeavor to respond at our earliest possible convenience to address your concern. If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may have additional options.</p>
<p>Residents in Designated Countries may also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant EU data protection authority. You may access a list of the Data Protection Authorities in the EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm">here</a>.</p>
