In addition, all pages on the website relating to your personal information will be protected using SSL technology, and account details  (including passwords)will be stored in our database in an encrypted form.</p>
<p>6.3 Of course, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.</p>

<p>6.5 You have control and responsibility over the privacy settings on your account. 3 privacy settings are available: public (anyone can view post), friends only (only “friends” can view post) or private (only the member who submitted the post can view post). These privacy settings can be applied to your action plan progress, your journals, your photos, who can send you private messages and who can view activity within your profile. However, if you respond to a post made by another user, the privacy setting of your post will default to the privacy setting of the post you are responding to. These privacy setting may be expanded in the future to include other types of content posted to the website.</p>
<p>6.6 Some user content will be published on the website (such as blog comments, questions and answers, success stories, tips, ratings, reviews and testimonials).</p>
