      We will not share identifiable personal data with third parties for the purposes of direct marketing without your explicit consent.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of IP addresses and cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system information and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing
      actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. A cookie is a small data file which is sent from a web server to a web browser when that browser
      visits the server's website. We use cookies to identify you when you visit this website, keep track of your browsing patterns and build up a demographic profile. They help us to improve our website and deliver a better and more personalised service.
    </p>
    <p>
      They enable us to:

    <ol>
      <li>

      <li>
        Store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our website according to your individual interest;

      <li>
        Speed up your searches; and
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computers, you should set your browser to refuse cookies. However, switching off cookies will restrict your use of our website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies,
      our system will issue cookies when you log on to our website.
    </p>

    <h2>￼Where we store your personal data</h2>
    <p>
      The data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged
      in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably
      necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

    </p>
    <p>
      We may disclose your personal information to third parties:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
      </li>
      <li>
        If Monzo Bank Ltd or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;
      </li>
      <li>
        If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers,
        or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction;
      </li>
      <li>
        If you give explicit permission to do so.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Access to information</h2>
    <p>
      You have a right to access the personal data held about you or to obtain a copy of it. Any access request may be subject to a statutory fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you. We may ask you to verify
