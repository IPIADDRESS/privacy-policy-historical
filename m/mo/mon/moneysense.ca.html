      </h4>
      <p>Personal information may include such information as your name, email address, mailing addresses, financial information, birth dates and information collected electronically via cookies.

      </p><h4><a name="ask"><b>Does Rogers Media Inc. ask for personal information?</b></a>

      </h4>
      <p>Yes.  Rogers Media Inc. will ask for your name, address, email address, and other personal information when you sign up for personalized services, such as portfolio tracker, online transactions and email newsletters (listservs).  You will also be asked for personal information when you enter contests or promotions sponsored by us or sponsored by our partners.

      </p><h4><a name="gathers"><b>How does Rogers Media Inc. use information it gathers about me?</b></a>

      </h4>
      <p>Rogers Media Inc. collects and uses your name, email address and other personal information, for example, to provide you with a product or service that you requested.  This information also enables Rogers Media Inc. to develop and customize products to better meet your needs and preferences and to offer you products and services from Rogers Media Inc., any of its affiliated companies within the Rogers group of companies and other sources that may be of interest to you.  

      </p><p>Rogers Media Inc. aims to provide you with the most relevant content and advertising possible.  We also aim to help our advertisers reach their target audience.  

      </p><p>Rogers Media Inc.'s Web site provides the opportunity to combine these goals.  For example, if advertisers give us an ad and say they want to reach investors 30 to 50 years old, we display the ad to users who have told us they fit that description.  Our advertisers never have access to personal information about you.  Only Rogers Media Inc. or affiliated companies within the Rogers group of companies have access to information about you account.

      </p><h4><a name="share"><b>Does Rogers Media Inc. share my personal information?  If so, with whom?</b></a>

        <li>When you give us permission to do so;
        </li><li>When we believe in good faith that the law requires it;

        </li><li>Under limited circumstances specifically described to you when we collect the information, such as in a Terms of Service or Use agreement, or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions;
        </li><li>To affiliated companies within the Rogers group of companies.
      </li></ul>
      <h4><a name="else"><b>When else might Rogers Media Inc. use my personal information?</b></a>

      </h4>
      <p>Subject to confidentiality agreements, Rogers Media Inc. may match aggregated, statistical user information to parameters established by third parties, without releasing user information.  This aggregated information does not contain any personally identifiable information.  For example, we may disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 31% of our users are professionals) in order to describe our site or services to trading partners, advertisers, other third parties and for other lawful purposes. 

      </p><h4><a name="direct_mailings"><b>Will Rogers Media Inc. use my information for direct mailings?</b></a>

      </h4>
