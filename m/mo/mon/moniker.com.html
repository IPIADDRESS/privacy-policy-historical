    <p>We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you.  When you provide personal information through our Site, the information may be sent to our servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.</p>
    <p><i><u>User Provided Information.</u></i>We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our Site or provide to us in some other manner including when you open up an account with us and use our registrar services.  This includes identifying information (such as your name, company name, physical address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card number, expiration date and billing address), and any other personal information you choose to provide while using our Site or the Services.</p> 
    <p><i><u>Third Party List Information.</u></i>We may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from third party data gathering sources.  We may match this third-party collected information with the personally identifying information that you provide to us.  When obtaining this information from third parties, Moniker seeks assurances from the third parties that it has the right to provide the information to us.</p>
    <p><i><u>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology.</u></i>We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our Site.  For example, we collect and store non-personally identifying information through cookies, log files, clear gifs ("web beacons"), and third parties to create a profile of our users that details the users' viewing preferences.

    </p>
    <p class="indented"><i>Log Files.</i>  Technical information from your browser is automatically collected when you visit our Site.

    <p class="indented"><i>Cookies.</i> A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer that tracks non-personal information about the user.  When using our Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which enable us to improve the quality of our Service and to personalize your experience.  Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about your activity on our Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while using our Site.  The cookies do not store any personally identifiable information about you.  Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to disable cookies.  If you choose to disable cookies, you will still be able to access our Site, but you may not be able to use all of the interactive features we offer.  Additional information on cookies can be found at: http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm.</p>
    <p class="indented"><i>Web Beacons.</i> We, or our advertisers, may use standard Internet technology such as web beacons (or "clear gifs") and other similar technologies, to gather aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about your use of our Site.  We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the quality of our Site.</p>
    <p class="indented"><i>Information collected by third-parties.</i>  We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with these advertisements and connect to other websites.

Please note that we do not have access to or control over third parties' cookies used on our Site, and this policy does not govern the use of cookies by these third parties.

If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.  Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.  The Site targets an audience that is over the age of 18 and some content may not be appropriate for all ages.  We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

Moniker reserves the right to discontinue providing bulk WHOIS data access to third parties.
<br>
In addition, you acknowledge and agree that, Moniker may make available and use personal information or other information you provide or that we otherwise maintain, to public or private third parties: (i) for inspection by law enforcement officials (including in the case of potential criminal activity); (ii) to respond to cease and desist letters, UDRP proceedings, legal actions and suits, criminal and civil subpoenas, court orders that reasonably appear to be valid; (iii) to enforce or apply the terms of this Privacy Policy or any other agreement between us; and (iv) to protect the rights, property, or safety of Moniker, our users, or others, whether during or after the term of your use of our Services.

<br><p><strong>Information Retention &amp; Security</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
Moniker stores your information for no less than one year from the time of initial submission, as well as automated personal information we collect about you.  However, if we collect your social security number or credit card number we will only store that information for a limited time unless extenuating circumstances or the law require otherwise.<br>
Moniker takes appropriate security measures to protect our users' information against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction.  These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information.  We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who have a "need-to-know"that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services, and who are bound by confidentiality requirements.  We want you to feel confident using our Site to transact business.  However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.

By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<br><p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p><p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our practices and Services.  We reserve the right to modify it at any time, so please review it frequently.  When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.  If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share personal information that may impact you, we will also prominently post notice of the changes on our Site and/or we may notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an e-mail address or you have opted-out of such communication).
