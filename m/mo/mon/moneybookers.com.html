The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") for the reasons set out below:</p><ul><li>if this is necessary for providing you with the services you request. For example if you transfer funds to a merchant that is not located in the EEA, it will be necessary to send your details to that merchant,</li><li>where our group companies, some of whom are based in the USA, store or process your data in accordance with our internal operational requirements and procedures in order to administer the services you require or in connection with anti-fraud measures,</li><li>where you have consented to receive marketing material from our group companies,</li><li>where our anti-fraud agencies, credit reference agencies and other service providers are based outside the EEA and require access to your data to perform their obligations to us and provide services to you,</li><li>if you have been referred to us by a third party and that third party is entitled to a commission payment – for further detail see section 5.4.</li></ul><div class="clearer"></div><p>We have taken and will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy no matter where it is located.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4.2. Security</strong><br>
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of information we have physical, electronic and managerial procedures in place to keep your information safe. Once logged into your Skrill Account, all internet communication is secured using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology with high security 128bit encryption, certified by Verisign Secured.<br>
However, this high level of protection can only be effective if you follow certain security practices yourself. You must never share your Skrill Account or login details with anyone. If you are concerned that any of your login details have been compromised, you can change them any time once you are logged on but you should always also immediately contact Customer Services and tell us why you think your login details have been compromised. Please read our Skrill Account Terms of Use for further information on how to keep your Skrill Account safe. Details of how to contact Customer Services are available from the “Contact” section of the Website.<br>
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. </p><p><strong>4.3. Retention</strong><br>
We are by law required to retain certain records for a period of at least five years after closure of your Skrill Account which will include your personal data such as your name, contact details, customer number and transaction history etc. Otherwise, we will delete and destroy all personal data that we hold about you when you (or we) terminate your Skrill Account. We do not store your online banking login PIN, TAN and password.&nbsp; </p>            	    	</div>

Merchants and other Skrill Customers</strong><br>
When sending money to another Skrill Account holder or a merchant who you wish to pay we will, at a minimum, pass on your email address to the recipient. Depending on the requirements of the merchant and the type of payment involved, we may also send other personal details such as your name, address and country of residence if the recipients request this information from us in order to improve the payment process, to reconcile payments with the commercial transaction or to conduct their own anti-fraud and anti-money laundering checks.</p><p><strong>5.3. Fraud and Credit Reference Agencies</strong><br>

We can provide you with a list of the credit reference agencies we use upon your written request to the email address set out in the Contact Us section below. When conducting identification or fraud prevention checks, the relevant parties may retain a record of our query along with your information and may share this information with other fraud prevention agencies.
