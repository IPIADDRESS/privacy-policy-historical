		<p><font size="2"><b>Personal information</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">In general, you can visit MONEY2020.COM on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription. You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us or a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at 
        MONEY2020.COM that you wish to be considered for. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Using and Sharing Personal Information</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">The following paragraphs describe in more detail how

		<p><font size="2">The information you provide to MONEY2020.COM on certain

		<p><font size="2"><b>Our Worldwide Practices</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">MONEY2020.COM is a global organization, with business processes and technical systems that cross borders.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, all over the world.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">We may share your personal information within 
        MONEY2020.COM and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries 
        MONEY2020.COM will still handle information in the manner we describe here.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Information Security and Quality</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement appropriate measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting certain sensitive information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Supplementing Information</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">From time to time we may supplement information you give us via a 
        MONEY2020.COM Web site with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information about businesses. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Use of Suppliers</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">In some cases MONEY2020.COM uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is 
        MONEY2020.COM's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with 
        MONEY2020.COM's policies.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on 
        MONEY2020.COM Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." 
        MONEY2020.COM or others on MONEY2020.COM's behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in an non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some 
        MONEY2020.COM pages use cookies, sent by MONEY2020.COM or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Some MONEY2020.COM Web sites also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across 
        MONEY2020.COM's Web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded. For more information, please see "How to work with Cookies".</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Service Quality Monitoring</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is 
        MONEY2020.COM's general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.</font></p>
