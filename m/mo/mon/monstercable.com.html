        <font size="-2">Effective Date: Oct 07, 2004</font> <br>
        <br>
        Monster Cable Products, Inc. and its corporate affiliates ("Monster" or 
        "we") provide this Web Site Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate 
        our commitment to respect your privacy. This Web Site Privacy Statement 
        explains how we collect certain personal information at our Web Site at 
        www.monstercable.com and any permutations thereof that directly link to 
        this Website Privacy Statement ("Web Site"). This Web Site Privacy Statement 
        also explains how we use and disclose such information - it does not, 
        however, apply to our use of data that we collect otherwise (e.g., offline 
        or through web sites of our foreign subsidiaries). If you do not agree 
        with this Web Site Privacy Statement, please do not access or use our 
        Web Site. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Personal and Non-Personal Information</b><br>
        Generally, you can visit Monster on the Web without telling us who you 
        are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. 
        We collect no such information about you when you visit our Web Site unless 
        you choose to provide that information to us. Monster may request or collect 
        certain personally identifiable information from or about you ("Personal 
        Information") in certain circumstances, as described in this Web Site 
        Privacy Statement and in specific privacy notices (described at the end 
        of this Web Site Privacy Statement under the header "Situations in Which 
        you Submit Personal Information"). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Log Files and Aggregate Information</b><br>
        Like most website operators, we collect and use IP addresses from browsing 
        machines to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, 
        and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Monster does 
        not link this information with Personal Information about individual users. 
        We may share with potential partners our aggregated demographic information 
        and aggregated information about the transactions conducted on our Web 
        Site. Information we share for these purposes is generally not linked 
        to any Personal Information that can identify any individual person or 
        company. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
        Our Web Site uses cookies to enhance your experience while visiting our 
        sites. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to the browsing computer 
        and used for record-keeping purposes. Cookies generally assist users by 
        performing certain functions such as saving passwords and personal preferences 
        regarding the sites. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry 
        standard. <br>
        <br>
        Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. If you would prefer not 
        to receive cookies, however, you can alter the configuration of your browser 
        to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, 
        it is possible that some areas of our sites will not function properly 
        when you view them. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Links</b><br>
        Our Web Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Monster 
        is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites, and 
        this Web Site Privacy Statement does not apply to such sites. We encourage 
        our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
        statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable 
        information. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Security</b><br>
        Monster endeavors to take reasonable technical and organizational measures 
        to protect the security of our users' Personal Information. We do not, 
        however, warrant or represent that your Personal Information is completely 
        safe from hackers and other security threats. If you have questions about 
        the security of this Web Site, please send an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@monstercable.com" class="smLight">webmaster@monstercable.com</a>.

        <b>Changes to this Web Site Privacy Statement</b><br>
        If we decide to change this Web Site Privacy Statement - which we reserve 
        the right to do, at any time, effective immediately - we will post the 
        revised policy at this location, or at another location that is accessible 
        via link from our homepage, so that users are always aware of what information 
        we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose 
        it, on any given day. If at any point we decide to use Personal Information 
        in a manner that is substantially different from that stated at the time 
        it was collected, we will seek to notify users by way of an email, and 
        provide users with a choice as to whether or not we use their information 
        in this different manner. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Obtain and Modify Information</b><br>
        We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your Personal Information 
        and try to keep information accurate and complete. Please contact us at

        to find out if and what Personal Information we may have related to you. 
        Also, if any of your Personal Information changes (such as zip code, phone, 
        email or postal address), please let us know at <a href="mailto:webmaster@monstercable.com" class="smLight">webmaster@monstercable.com</a>.

        <b>Unsubscribe</b><br>
        If you do not wish to receive future communications from us, you can send 
        an e-mail to <a href="mailto:webmaster@monstercable.com" class="smLight">webmaster@monstercable.com</a> 
        with the subject stating "UNSUBSCRIBE." <br>
        <br>
        <b>Transfer of Personal Information</b> <br>
        Monster will generally not transfer Personal Information to third parties 
        except as disclosed in this Web Site Privacy Statement or in specific 
        privacy notices (described at the end of this Web Site Privacy Statement 
        under the header "Situations in Which You Submit Personal Information"). 
        <br>
        <br>
        We generally reserve the right, however, to transfer any non-personal 
        information without restrictions and to transfer Personal Information 
        in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, and/or sale 
        of all or substantially all of our assets. Also, we may use or disclose 
        Personal Information as required or permitted by law and/or if we believe 
        that such action is necessary to comply with a legal requirement, a court 
        order, request by law enforcement officials, or other legal process, or 
        to protect the rights, property, and safety of others or ourselves. We 
        also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities 
        that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. <br>
        <br>
        We also share Personal Information within the Monster group and affiliated 
        companies. <br>
        <br>
        In addition, we may need to transfer Personal Information to third parties 
        who perform services on our behalf in your interest. For example, we may 
        release personal information to third parties to fulfill customer orders, 
        send Monster marketing communications, deliver packages, fulfill subscriptions, 
        schedule and perform installation and servicing, conduct research or surveys, 
        send regular mail and e-mail on behalf of Monster, or to process credit 
        card payments. <br>
