            <h2>What Information is Collected?</h2>
            <br>
            At Moneris, we collect, use and disclose Personal Information to provide 
            you with the services you have requested and to offer you additional 
            products and services we believe you might be interested in. Providing 
            us with your Personal Information is always your choice.<br> <br>
            The types of Personal Information we may ask for depends on the nature 
            of the services we provide you and typically includes your name, address, 
            telephone number and e-mail address. <br> <br>
            When you visit the Moneris websites, Personal Information is not collected 
            unless you choose to provide it voluntarily. You are welcome to browse 
            the websites at any time anonymously and privately without revealing 
            any personal information about yourself.<br> <br>
            For purposes of maintaining quality service, calls to any of our customer 
            service lines may be recorded. A recorded message given prior to your 
            call being answered will let you know if your call may be the subject 
            of our random call recording quality assurance program. <br> <br> 
            <h2>Types of Information We Collect</h2>
            <br> <b>Personal Information</b><br> <br>
            Most of the Personal Information we collect comes to us directly from 
            you, and only with your consent. With your consent, we may collect 
            Personal Information from you in person, over the telephone or by 
            corresponding with you via mail, facsimile, the Internet, or from 
            referrals by third parties such as your financial institution.<br> 
            <br>
            When you visit the Giftcertificates.ca website, we may also collect 
            from you Personal Information about another individual in order to 
            send them a gift certificate.<br> <br>
            As noted, the choice to provide us with Personal Information is always 
            yours. However, your decision to withhold particular details may limit 
            our ability to provide you with any of our services.<br> <br>
            If we are unable to accommodate your request based on the information 
            that has been provided to us, we may ask for additional details in 
            order to identify other ways to be of assistance. Moneris also maintains 
            a file containing contact history that is used for customer inquiry 
            purposes. <br> <br> <b>Anonymous/Non-Personal Information</b><br> 
            <br>
            At Moneris, we also collect anonymous/non-personal information. Anonymous/non-personal 
            information is information that we do not associate with or trace 
            back to a specific individual or business entity. For example, our 
            web servers collect some anonymous/non-personal information automatically 
            when you visit one of our websites. Gathered electronically, this 
            information may include the pages you visited, the type of web browser 
            you are using, the level of encryption your browser supports and your 
            Internet Protocol address. The anonymous/non-personal information 
            collected may be used for research and analytical purposes and occasionally 
            for security investigations. <br> <br>
            To help us better understand our markets, we may also gather information 
            for analytical purposes by conducting customer surveys, and by extracting 
            demographic information from existing files.<br> <br> <b>Consent</b><br> 
            <br>
            Your provision of Personal Information to us means that: (a) you agree 
            and consent that we may collect, use and disclose your Personal Information 
            in accordance with this policy; and (b) you or your representatives 
            are authorized to provide us with your Personal Information. If you 
            do not agree with these terms, you and your representatives are requested 
            not to provide any Personal Information to Moneris. Certain services 
            can only be offered if you provide Personal Information to Moneris. 
            Consequently, if you and your representatives choose not to provide 
            us with any required Personal Information, we may not be able to offer 
            you certain services.<br> <br> <h2>How Your Information is Used</h2>
            <br> <b>Personal Information</b><br> <br>
            We use your Personal Information to communicate with you, effectively 
            provide the services you have requested and safeguard your interests. 
            We may also send you information about other products and services 
            in which we believe you may be interested. Additionally, if you are 
            a Moneris merchant client, we will keep you informed about your merchant 
            account activities, send you important notices, and respond to any 
            special needs or enquiries you may have.<br> <br>

            In particular, if you are a Moneris merchant customer, our merchant 
            agreement with you authorizes us to use and disclose the Personal

            We only use Personal Information for the purposes that we have disclosed 
            to you. If for any reason your information is required to fulfill 
            a different purpose, we will obtain your consent before we proceed.<br> 
            <br> <b>Anonymous/Non-Personal Information</b><br> <br>
            The anonymous/non-personal information gathered from the Moneris websites 
            is used primarily for technical, research and analytical purposes 
            like evaluating the various sections of the websites. This information 
            does not include any personal information and it is only retained 
            until its intended purpose is fulfilled.<br> <br>
            It is our goal to continuously improve our service offerings to you. 
            Therefore, we use anonymous/non-personal information collected from 
            surveys, from public archives and by extracting information from existing 
            files to better understand our customers' interests, priorities, and 
            satisfaction levels.<br> <br> 
			<h2>When Information May be Disclosed to Outside Parties </h2>
            <br>
            We are obliged to keep your Personal Information confidential except 
            when authorized by you, when required by law and when permitted by 
            law.<br> <br>
            At Moneris, we sometimes contract outside organizations to perform 
            specialized services such as terminal delivery and repair, and shipping 
            and fulfillment services. Our trusted service suppliers may at times 
            be responsible for processing and handling some of the information 
            we receive from you. <br> <br>
            When we contract our suppliers to provide specialized services, they 
            are given only the information necessary to perform those services. 
            Additionally, they are prohibited from storing, analyzing or using 
            that information for purposes other than to carry out the service 
            they have been contracted to provide. Furthermore, as part of our 
            agreements, our suppliers and their employees and representatives 
            are required to protect your information in a manner that is consistent 
            with the privacy policies and practices that we have established.<br> 
            <br> <b>When Required by Law</b><br> <br>
            The type of information we are legally required to disclose may relate 
            to criminal investigations or government tax reporting requirements. 
            In some instances such as a legal proceeding or court order, we may 
            also be required to disclose certain information to authorities. Only 
            the information specifically requested is disclosed and we take precautions 
            to satisfy ourselves that the authorities that are making the request 
            have legitimate grounds to do so.<br> <br> <b>When Permitted by 
            Law</b><br> <br>
            There are some situations where we are legally permitted to disclose 
            personal information such as employing reasonable and legal methods 
            to enforce our rights under our agreements, to collect a delinquent 
            account or investigate suspicion of illegal activities.<br> <br> 
            <h2>With Whom We May Share Your Information</h2>
            <br> <b>Our Employees and Contractors</b><br> <br>
            In the course of daily operations, access to private, sensitive and 
            confidential information is restricted to authorized employees who 
            have a legitimate business purpose and reason for accessing it. For 
            example, when you call us, our designated employees will access your 
            information to verify who you are and to assist you in fulfilling 
            your requests.<br> <br>
            As a condition of their employment and their independent contractor 
            agreement respectively, all employees and independent contractors 
            of Moneris are informed about the importance of privacy and are required 
            to abide by the privacy standards we have established. They are also 
            required to work within the principles of ethical behaviour as set 
            out in the relevant Code of Conduct and must follow all applicable 
            laws and regulations.<br> <br>
            Unauthorized access to and/or disclosure of customer information by 
            an employee of Moneris is strictly prohibited. All employees and independent 
            contractors are expected to maintain the confidentiality of customer 
            information at all times and failing to do so will result in appropriate 
            disciplinary measures, which may include dismissal.<br> <br> 
			<h2>How We Safeguard Your Information</h2>
            <br>
            We use state-of-the-art technologies and maintain current security 
            standards to ensure that your Personal Information is protected against 
            unauthorized access, disclosure, inappropriate alteration or misuse. 
            All safety and security measures are also appropriate to the sensitivity 
            level of your information.<br> <br> <b>Customer Files</b><br> 
            <br>
            Electronic customer files are kept in a highly secured environment 
            with restricted access. Paper-based files are stored in locked filing 
            cabinets. Access is also restricted.<br> <br> <b>Online Security</b><br> 
            <br>
            We manage our server environment appropriately and our firewall infrastructure 
            is strictly adhered to. Our security practices are reviewed on a regular 
            basis and we routinely employ current technologies to ensure that 
            the confidentiality and privacy of your information is not compromised.<br> 
            <br>
            The Moneris websites use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and 128 bit encryption 
            technologies to enhance security when you visit the secured areas 
            of these sites. SSL is the industry standard tool for protecting and 
            maintaining the security of message transmissions over the Internet. 
            When you access your accounts or send information from secured sites, 
            encryption will scramble your data into an unreadable format to inhibit 
            unauthorized access by others.<br> <br>
            To safeguard against unauthorized access to your accounts, you may 
            be required to "sign-on" using a user id and a password to certain 
            secured areas of the Moneris websites. Both user id and password are 
            encrypted when sent over the Internet. If you are unable to provide 
            the correct password, you will not be able to access these sections.<br> 
            <br>
            When you call our customer service centre you will be required to 
            verify your identity by providing some personally identifying information.<br> 
            <br> <h2>How You Can Protect Your Information</h2>
            <br>
            We do our utmost to protect and safeguard your Personal Information. 
            We believe there are measures you should take as well. The following 
            is a list of things you can do to protect yourself against fraud and 
            uninvited intrusion.<br> <br> <b>Passwords</b><br> <br>
            Passwords are necessary to identify you and authenticate your permission 
            to access your online accounts. The passwords you use are encrypted. 
            Encryption is presently the most effective way to achieve data security. 
            Just as it is important for us to employ strict procedures to safeguard 
            your information, you also should take precautions in handling your 
            passwords. When selecting a password, we suggest that you use a combination 
            of letters and numbers and do not use words that can be easily associated 
            with you such as the name of a family member, a pet or the street 
            on which you live. We also suggest that you change your password regularly.<br> 
            <br> <b>Personal Information</b><br> <br>
            You should not share personal information with others unless you clearly 
            understand the purpose of their request and you know who you are dealing 
            with.<br> <br> <b>Your Online Security</b><br> <br>
            To make sure your connection to the protected areas of the Moneris 
            websites is secure, look for either a 'closed lock' or an 'unbroken 
            key' icon located at the bottom right hand side of your browser's 
            task bar. You may also check the Address bar to determine if SSL (Secure 
            Socket Layer) is active by looking at the beginning of the address. 
            If it starts with "https" rather than the standard "http", then SSL 
            is operating.<br> <br> <h2>Accessing and Amending Your Information</h2>
            <br>
            At Moneris, decisions are made based on the information we have. Therefore, 
            it is important that your Personal Information is accurate and complete. 
            As a customer, you have the right to access, verify and amend the 
            information held in your personal and financial files.<br> <br> 
            <b>Accessing Your Information</b><br> <br>
            For privacy-related matters, you may access and verify any of your 
            information by calling our customer contact centre at <b>1-866-319-7450</b>.<br> 
            <br> <b>Amending Your Information</b><br> <br>

            you to amend inaccuracies and make corrections as often as necessary. 
            Despite our efforts, errors sometimes do occur. Should you identify 
            any incorrect or out-of-date information in your file(s), we will 
            make the proper changes. Where appropriate, we will communicate these 
            changes to other parties who may have unintentionally received incorrect 
            information from us.<br> <br> <b>To Make a Change</b><br> <br>
            To make a change to the personal contact information contained in 
            your file, you may do one of the following:<br> <br> 
			 <ul type="a">

            In each case, you will be required to verify your identity by providing 
            some personally identifying information.<br> <br> <h2>About Cookies</h2>
