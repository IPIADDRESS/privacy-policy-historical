      friends. This utility does not retain or store the e-mail addresses users
      enter into the form. Use of this feature is completely anonymous.</font></p>
      <p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">From time to time NewsMax.com
      will offer a survey in regards to a current news topic. We may request
      your email address, but this is only used to limit multiple same user
      entries. These email addresses are not utilized in any other way nor can
      your vote be matched with your email address or any other user data.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">NewsMax.com gathers information about users 
            from data that is provided through optional, voluntary registrations,

            and data NewsMax.com gathers through aggregating tracking information 
            derived mainly by tallying page views and hits throughout our site. 
            Such information enables us to better tailor our content to readers' 
            needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics 
            of our audience. Because NewsMax.com derives much of its revenues 
            from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential 
            to keeping our service free to users. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">NewsMax.com does not rent to third parties our opt-in email lists. We do allow advertising, however, in our news emails.

                  (Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer) becomes

                    clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access 
                    to your information. Each filing cabinet has a lock, and keys
