      <p>Thank you for using the Montgomery County, Maryland Government (hereafter, 
        the County) web portal. We hope that you find our web portal to be a convenient 
        and valuable resource for interacting with County Governmental organizations. 
        In order to be of value, we know that you must be able to trust that any 
        information you provide while interacting with the County will be kept 
        private and secure. This document represents our Privacy Policy and it 
        is intended to serve two purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide guidance to County employees regarding how to develop, 
          secure and maintain the County portal and</li>
        <li>To assure you that your information will be kept private and secure.<br>
          It is our statement concerning how your information will be protected. 
          If you have questions or doubts concerning the privacy of your information, 
          you should consult this document. If, after consulting this document 
          you still have questions or doubts, you should contact:</li>
      </ul>
      <div align="center">Montgomery County, Maryland Government <br>
        ATTN: Renee Yue<br>
        51 Monroe Street<br>
        Suite 100<br>
        Rockville, Maryland 20850 </div>
      <p align="center"><a href="mailto:Customer.Service@co.mo.md.us">Customer.Service@co.mo.md.us</a></p>
      <p>The County adheres to and follows the practices and procedures described 
        below for the purpose of assuring the privacy of visitors to the County 
        web portal. These practices and procedures are approved by the Department 
        of Technology Services, the Office of the County Attorney, and the Office 
        of the County Executive. The County reserves the right to change these 
        practices and procedures at any time without prior notice. The following 
        is not intended and should not be interpreted as a contract of any nature, 
        either stated or implied. </p>
      <p>In addition to the above, the County also complies with the requirements 
        for administering information systems as established in the Maryland Public 
        Information Act (PIA) Title 10, Subtitle 6, Part III of the State Government 
        Article. The PIA covers all counties, including Montgomery County, cities, 
        towns, school districts, and special districts like soil conservation 
        or sanitary sewage districts. <br>
        Beginning October 1, 2000 the PIA restricts the County's ability to create 
        "personal records" and collect "<a href="#personalinfo">personal 
        information</a>" The County cannot create personal records unless 
        it clearly establishes the need for that information. A "personal 
        record" is one that names or, with reasonable certainty, otherwise 
        identifies an individual by an identifying factor such as an address, 
        a description, a finger or voice print, a number or a picture. The County 
        establishes its need to create personal records by showing that it is 
        either needed to execute some legal obligation like collect property taxes 
        or that it is needed for administrative convenience. The County collects 
        personal information directly from individuals who choose to use one or 
        more of the County's web applications. Collecting personal information 
        is necessary in order to deliver the services requested.</p>
      <p><b>CUSTOMER TRUST: </b><br>
        Fostering and maintaining the public's trust is a cornerstone of the County's 
        web portal program. We appreciate the trust and confidence that you place 
        in us by providing requested personal information<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>TRUSTe Privacy Program Registration Pending.</b></p>
      <p>To ensure your trust, the County is a pending licensee member of the 
        TRUSTe Privacy Program. The TRUSTe Privacy Program is like a "Seal 
        of Good Housekeeping." Licensees undergo a thorough privacy and security 
        evaluation by the TRUSTe organization. Only when the licensee has successfully 
        passed the evaluation can it display the TRUSTe trust-mark. The County 
        is currently undergoing such an evaluation. Once the County passes the 
        evaluation, it will display the TRUSTe trust-mark on its web portal. The 
        trust-mark will link to this privacy statement. On our privacy statement 
        there will be a "click to verify" seal which links, via secure 
        server, to a TRUSTe validation page where the evaluated copy of our Privacy 
        Policy will be available for review and comparison. <br>
        As part of the TRUSTe evaluation, the County has disclosed procedures 
        for the operation of the County web portal (<a href="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov">www.montgomerycountymd.gov</a>). 
        When you visit our web site displaying the TRUSTe trust-mark, you can 
        expect to be informed of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What organization in the County is collecting your information</li>
        <li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected</li>
        <li>How your information is used</li>
        <li>Whether and when the County uses Cookies</li>
        <li>With whom your information may be shared</li>
        <li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution 
          of your information</li>
        <li>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect you</li>
        <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in your information</li>
        <li>Procedures for limiting employee access to information and </li>
        <li>How to contact the County</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What organization(s) in the County is/are collecting the your information:</li></ul>
		 
      <p>The County consists of those organizations and agencies identified in 
        the <a href="/Content/government/aboutgovt/OrgChart.asp">County Organization 
        Chart</a> found on the web site. Only County organization(s) are permitted 
        to collect information from you when you visit the County web site. These 
        organizations most often collect information by asking you to fill out 
        forms. The data you enter into the forms is stored in data bases. By completing 
        forms you are electing to authorize the use of information that you provide. 
        If you do not wish the County to use your information, you should not 
        complete web forms. However, by electing not to complete web forms you, 
        will be unable to receive the web services that you otherwise would have 
        received.<br>
      </p>
      <ul><li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected:</li></ul>
      <p>We endeavor to collect only the minimum amount of information needed. 
        Though personal information may be required either by law or in order 
        for us to provide a requested service, in doing so we try to minimize 
        the scope of our information requests. Examples of personally identifiable 
        information that we request can include your name, your address, your 
        telephone number and e-mail address, and your bank account number and 
        bank routing number and your credit card account number and credit card 
        expiration date. The type of information we collect depends upon the application 
        used and the products or services being requested. For each visitor, we 
        also collect information about the Internet Protocol (IP) address, type 
        of browser used, the date and time of the visit, and the IP addresses 
        of the locations to which the visitor linked during his or her visit to 
        our web site. This information is strictly used for statistical reporting 
        purposes.<br>
      </p>
      <ul><li>How your information is used:</li></ul>
      <p>We collect, retain and use personal information only where we believe 
        it is essential (and allowed by law) to perform our mission of providing 
        products, services, information and other opportunities requested by our 
        web portal visitors. Customer information collected, used, and retained 
        at the County's web site is considered confidential and will not be shared 
        for marketing or other unauthorized purposes. <br>
      </p>
      <ul><li>Whether and when the County uses cookies:</li></ul>
      <p>In certain web portal applications user information is collected and 
        stored as "cookies." Cookies are then sent back and stored on 
        the user's computer. Cookies allow computer applications to recognize 
        you when you return after having logged off. This permits the application 
        to start where you left off rather than require you to begin again from 
        the beginning. Any County application or web page that uses cookies will 
        identify itself as such. This information is handled in the same way as 
        other user information obtained by the County. No user information is 
        gathered through cookies except for that needed to run the specific application. 
        To avoid the collection of information for cookies you should not use 
        any applications that use cookies. <br>
      </p>
     <ul><li>With whom your information may be shared: (Restrictions on the 
        disclosure of customer information)</li></ul>
      <p>The County does not sell, rent, or otherwise allow access to visitors/subscribers' 
        information to/by any outside company or organization. We do not reveal 
        specific information about subscribers or other personally identifiable 
        data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except if 
        required to do so by law. <br>
      </p>
      <ul><li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and 
        distribution of your information:</li></ul>
      <p>The County web portal makes frequent use of web forms to collect information. 
        As indicated above, you have the choice not to complete web forms. However, 
        by electing not to complete web forms, you will be unable to receive the 
        web services that you otherwise could/would have received.<br>
        Some County web portal applications limit access to a selected group of 
        people or organizations. The main method used to control access is the 
        assignment of user names/identification numbers and the creation of passwords. 
        Each potential program customer is given the option to obtain or create 
        a user name/identification number and password. The username and password 
        are needed to authenticate to and use the County web site application. 
        The user name and password serve to prove your identity to the County 
        thereby enabling you to use the application in order to obtain the products 
        and/or services the application provides. You have the option of obtaining 
        a user name/identification number and password or not. Not obtaining the 
        required authentication capability is the same as not completing a web 
        form - you prevent the collection of your information. However, you also 
        forfeit the use of the application and the products or services it otherwise 
        could/would deliver. You must obtain those products or services by some 
        means other than through the web portal. <br>
        Users electing to use the forms or applications are responsible to ensure 
        all of their information is correct and that their user name/identification 
        number and password are protected from unauthorized use. <br>
      </p>
      <ul><li>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect you: 
        (Protection of information via established security procedures)</li></ul>
      <p>We are dedicated to the proposition that you have a right to privacy 
        and data security on the web. The County sets and meets high security 
        standards and follows rigorous procedures to prevent unauthorized access 
        to or disclosure of customer information and to prevent unauthorized removal 
        or alteration of data. We are committed to handling the information you 
        provide responsibly. <br>
        The County provides its users with a secure online experience by using 
        a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal 
        information. All user registration information is contained behind a "firewall" 
        and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special 
        access rights to production systems. Password and credit card numbers 
        are encrypted in a secure database located behind the "firewall". 
        All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via 
        Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology and encrypted in the database. 
        The County uses digital signature technology to assure you are interacting 
        with the County and not an illegitimate replacement or substitute. <br>
      </p>
      <ul><li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in your information: (Maintenance 
        of accurate information)</li></ul>
      <p>The County has established procedures to ensure that information is as 
        accurate and current as is practical to enable us to conduct business 
        with you. Although we strive to do things right the first time, we also 
        respond to requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner. 
        The user must contact the County immediately if they believe their information, 
        including user names/identification numbers and passwords, has been corrupted, 
        misused, or is incorrect.<br>
      </p>
      <ul><li>Procedures for limiting employee access to information:</li></ul>
      <p>Our network manager is instructed to limit employee access to personally 
        identifiable information to only those employees who need access in order 
        to perform their assigned duties. The network manager is instructed to 
        enforce with his/her staff their responsibilities in protecting subscriber's 
        information. <br>
      </p>
      <ul><li>How to contact the County:</li></ul>
      <p>We welcome your comments and invite you to contact us if you have any 
        questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy. Contact us at: </p>
