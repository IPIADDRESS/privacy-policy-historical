				Acquisition Media, LLC ("Acquisition Media") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the
				ELoanPersonal.com website (the "Website"). Acquisition Media created this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy")
				to give you confidence as you visit and use the Website, and to demonstrate its commitment to fair information
				practices and to the protection of privacy.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing the Website via a personal computer, a mobile
				device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered. This Privacy
				Policy is only applicable to the Website and not to any websites owned by Acquisition Media's parent
				companies, subsidiaries or affiliates or other third-parties (collectively, "Third-Party Websites"), which
				may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.
				For additional information, see the section concerning Third-Party Websites, below.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT: (1) YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD, A
				RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND ARE OTHERWISE LEGALLY QUALIFIED TO ENTER INTO AND FORM
				CONTRACTS UNDER APPLICABLE LAW; AND (2)  YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THE
				TERMS OF, THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS
				PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE WEBSITE.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Each time you use the Website, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply.
				Accordingly, each time you use the Website you should check the date of this Privacy Policy
				(which appears at the end) and review any changes since the last time you used the Website.
				For additional information, see the section concerning Updates and Changes to Privacy
				Policy, below.

				<h2>1.	U.S. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
				<br>
				
				The Website is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in
				accordance with the laws of the U.S. Acquisition Media makes no representation that this
				Website is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by,
				other nations.
				<br>
				<br>

				and use the Website at your own risk and initiative and you, not us, are responsible
				for compliance with any applicable local and national laws. By using the Website and/or
				providing us with your Personal Information (as defined in Section 3(e), below), you: (1)
				consent to the transfers and processing of any Personal Information you provide to the
				Website; (2) acknowledge that U.S. law provides a lower standard of protection for personal
				data than the laws of various countries including, but not limited to, the European Union;

				<h2>2.	CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
				<br>
				
				Acquisition Media does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information
				from children under the age of 13. If Acquisition Media obtains actual knowledge that it has
				collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, Acquisition
				Media will immediately delete such information from its database. Because Acquisition Media
				does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13,
				Acquisition Media has no such information to use or disclose to third parties.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<a name="3">&nbsp;</a>
				<h2>3.	INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</h2>
				<br>
				
				(a)	Traffic Data.  Like most website operators, Acquisition Media automatically gathers
				information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) Internet
				Protocol (IP) addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the
				Website; (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website; and (v) full Uniform Resource
				Locator ("URL") click stream data, including referring URLs, date and time, and content
				viewed or searched for on the Website (collectively "Traffic Data").  Traffic Data is
				anonymous information that does not personally identify you.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				(b)	Cookies.  A "Cookie" is a string of information that a website stores on a user's
				computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits
				a query to the website.  The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique
				user of the Website.  Acquisition Media uses "session" cookies to collect information
				about your use of the Website and to give you a more personalized browsing experience
				and help you navigate the Website more efficiently from page to page. These cookies
				are temporary and are deleted when you close your browser. Acquisition Media uses
				"persistent" cookies to gather statistical information about repeat usage from your
				computer or workstation. For additional information on Acquisition Media' uses of
				Cookies, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic
				Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies and Web Beacons, below.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR
				BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
				THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION
				PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES.  IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL
				RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				(c)	Web Beacons. "Web Beacons" (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs)
				are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, and
				are used to track the online movements of web users or to access Cookies. Unlike
				Cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, Web Beacons are embedded
				invisibly on web pages (or in e-mail). Web Beacons may be used to deliver or
				communicate with Cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to
				understand usage patterns. For additional information on Acquisition Media' uses
				of Web Beacons, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure
				Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies &amp; Web Beacons, below.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				(d)	Ad Serving. Acquisition Media uses third-parties for advertising and analytics
				for pages that we host. These third-parties may place Cookies on your machine, use
				Web Beacons, gather Personal Information, gather IP addresses and log data to collect
				traffic and activity data in order to deliver relevant metrics, content, and
				advertising. The collection of this information by third-parties are subject to
				such third-parties' privacy policies.  For additional information, see the section
				concerning Third-Party Websites, below.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				(e)	Personal Information. During the loan application process, you will be asked
				to provide Acquisition Media certain information that personally identifies you
				("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes, without limitation: (1)
				"Identity/Contact Data" (such as your name, address, email address, social security
				number, driver's license or state ID number, your employer and your employer's
				address); (2) "Financial Information" (such as your bank, bank address, bank
				phone number, bank account type, length of time with your bank, your ABA routing
				number and your account number); (3 ) "Demographic Data" (such as your
				birthday, city/town, zip code, state, home ownership status, employment
				history, pay period frequency, next pay period and monthly income). In each
				case, you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Website will
				not gather it surreptitiously. BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL ACCOUNT NUMBERS AND
				SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, YOU THEREBY EXPRESSLY CONSENT THE COLLECTION BY
				ACQUISTION MEDIA OF SUCH INFORMATION. Acquisition Media may supplement the
				Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered
				from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies,
				third-party service providers, etc.) who may lawfully provide such information
				to Acquisition Media.
