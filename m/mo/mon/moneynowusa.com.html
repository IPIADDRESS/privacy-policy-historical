				<p>We are committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the Website (all capitalized terms not defined in this policy have the same meanings as in the <a href="http://www.moneynowusa.com/terms_conditions.php">terms of use</a>).&nbsp; We created this privacy policy (the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span>”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Website, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of privacy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing the Website via a personal computer, a mobile device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Website and not to any websites owned by our parent companies, subsidiaries or affiliates or other third-parties (collectively, “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third-Party Websites</span>”), which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; For additional information, see the section concerning Third-Party Websites, below.</p>
<p><b>By using the Website or Services, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old, a resident of the United States, and are otherwise legally qualified to enter into and form contracts under applicable law.</b></p>
<p>Each time you use the Website, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, each time you use the Website you should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the end) and review any changes since the last time you used the Website. For additional information, see the section concerning Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy, below.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">U.S. GOVERNING LAW</span></b></p>
<p>The Website is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. We make no representation that this Website is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations.</p>
<p>If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S., your access and use the Website at your own risk and initiative and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws. By using the Website and/or providing us with your Personal Information (as defined below), you: (1) consent to the transfers and processing of any Personal Information you provide to the Website; (2) acknowledge that U.S. law provides a lower standard of protection for personal data than the laws of various countries including, but not limited to, the European Union; and (3) understand that the Website will deal with your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and U.S. law. <b>Consequently, you hereby waive any claims that may arise under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction. </b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES </span></b></p>
<p><b>a. Traffic Data.&nbsp; </b>Like most website operators, we automatically gather information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website; and (v) full Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) click stream data, including referring URLs, date and time, and content viewed or searched for on the Website (collectively “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Traffic Data</span>”).&nbsp; Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.</p>
<p><b>b. Cookies.&nbsp; </b>A “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookie</span>” is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website.&nbsp; The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website.&nbsp; We use “session” cookies to collect information about your use of the Website and to give you a more personalized browsing experience and help you navigate the Website more efficiently from page to page. These Cookies are temporary and are deleted when you close your browser. We use “persistent” cookies to gather statistical information about repeat usage from your computer or workstation. For additional information on our uses of Cookies, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies and Web Beacons, below.</p>
<p><b>If you do not wish to have Cookies placed on your computer, you should set your browsers to refuse Cookies before accessing the Website, with the understanding that certain of the services and certain features of the Website may not function properly without the aid of Cookies.&nbsp; If you refuse Cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality. </b></p>
<p><b>c. Web Beacons. </b>“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Web Beacons</span>” (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access Cookies. Unlike Cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, Web Beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages (or in e-mail). Web Beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. For additional information on our uses of Web Beacons, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies &amp; Web Beacons, below.</p>
<p><b>d. Ad Serving. </b>We use third-parties for advertising and analytics for pages that we host. These third-parties may place Cookies on your machine, use Web Beacons, gather Personal Information, gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data in order to deliver relevant metrics, content, and advertising. The collection of this information by third-parties are subject to such third-parties’ privacy policies.&nbsp; For additional information, see the section concerning Third-Party Websites, below.</p>
<p><b>e. Personal Information.</b> During the loan application process, you will be asked to provide us certain information that personally identifies you (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Information</span>”). Personal Information includes, without limitation: (1) “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Identity/Contact Data</span>” (such as your name, address, email address, social security number, driver’s license or state ID number, your employer and your employer’s address); (2) “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Financial Information</span>” (such as your bank, bank address, bank phone number, bank account type, length of time with your bank, your ABA routing number and your account number); (3 ) “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Demographic Data</span>” (such as your birthday, city/town, zip code, state, home ownership status, employment history, pay period frequency, next pay period and monthly income). In each case, you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Website will not gather it surreptitiously. <b>By providing financial account numbers and social security numbers, you consent the collection by us of such information.</b> We may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies, third-party service providers, etc.) who may lawfully provide such information to us.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INFORMATION USE AND DISCLOSURE PRACTICES</span></b></p>
<p><b>a. Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies and Web Beacons</b></p>
<p>We analyze Traffic Data and information gathered using Cookies and Web Beacons to help us better understand who is using the Website and how they are using it.

<p><b>b. Personal Information</b></p>
<p><b>i.

</ul>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</span></b></p>
<p>Under California’s “Shine the Light” law (CA Civil Code § 1798.83), California residents who provide personal information to businesses in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to either: (1) a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided; or (2) to be notified of a mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having their information shared with third parties. We have elected the second option. To opt-out of having your information shared with third parties, click <a href="http://optout-rmkt.net/">here</a> and follow the opt-out instructions.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</span></b></p>
