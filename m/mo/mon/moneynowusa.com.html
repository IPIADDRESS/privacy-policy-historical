				information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to either: (1)
				a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided;

				<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				<br>

				an intention to specifically identify, contact or locate a person, including but not limited to name, address, telephone
				number, or e-mail address. Conversely, Non-PII is data that is not used to specifically identify, contact or locate an
				individual, including but not limited to zip code, gender, age, or IP address.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Website Registration Forms</strong>
				<br>

				should change, we ask that you re-submit a registration form or request.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Publisher Partners</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				When you complete a registration or offer form that is hosted by one of our website publisher partners on our behalf,
				the website publisher partner may submit all or a portion of the information that you submitted on the form to the Company.
				This information may include, but is not limited to: your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number,
				date of birth, gender, and payment information; information about your background, interests, health, education, career goals,
				and shopping preferences; and any other information you provide to our website publisher partner.

				<br>
				
				
				We may receive information about you, including but not limited to your IP address, e-mail address, first name, last name,
				mailing address, and telephone number, from third party marketing partners that provide us with consumer data to manage on
				their behalf.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Automatic Information/Digital Identifiers</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may automatically receive and store certain types of information about you through the data sources listed below.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				You may be familiar with the term "cookies," which are unique alphanumeric identifiers that store information on your
				computer. A cookie is placed on your computer when your web browser accesses our website. We use cookies for tracking
				transactions and the user characteristics explained in detail throughout this Privacy Policy. If you choose, there are
				utilities available for purchase from independent software providers to install on your computer as well as tools/preferences
				you can choose through most web browsers to make website visits anonymous. Of course, cookies let you have a more satisfying
				website experience, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We also collect information through our web server applications. This information includes your Internet Protocol or "IP"
				address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				Additionally, we may use pixel tracking technology to track the completion of transactions with us or our advertisers,
				the source information for those transactions, and your IP address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. 
				This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by MoneyNowUSA.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Government Forms</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				The Company may be required to create, collect, maintain, and submit certain information required by
				the government, such as IRS Forms W-9 and 1099. This information, which may include your taxpayer identification
				number, will not be used, shared, transferred, or sold for marketing purposes.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>HOW DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION?</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may use the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose in our sole discretion, including but
				not limited to those explained below.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information.
				We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Pre-select/Pre-fill Offers</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				Our website technology may pre-select certain offers for you to view based on the demographic and geographic information
				you submitted to the Company during the website registration process. Additionally, this technology may pre-fill some or
				all of the offers' data fields with the information you submitted during the website registration process in order to prevent
				you from having to re-enter this information. We may not show all of the pre-filled data fields to you.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Customer Service and Fulfillment</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may use your information to operate the website promotion, service your account and to fulfill rewards earned through
				Company websites. We may also use your information to verify your identity or claimed account status and, where we consider
				appropriate, investigate your compliance with the terms and conditions of the website promotion or any advertiser offer. We
				do retain customer service correspondence.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Marketing</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may use your information in our online (e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging,
				skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs. If you would like to be removed from these programs,
				<a href="http://www.optout-blgl.net/o-lglb-c11-d78ec46a9b45bb143e83500f6709101d">click here</a> and follow

				registration process will be transferred to advertisers that we believe may be of interest to you without providing you with
				another opportunity to review the information.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				When you select "yes" next to an offer, we will transfer some or all of the information that you submitted during the

				<br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Ad Serving Companies</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may use third party ad networks or ad serving companies to serve advertisements on our websites. We pass information

				The information passed to these companies may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing
				address, telephone number, date of birth, gender, and any other information you provide to us. Web pages that are served by
				these companies will state that they are "powered by" or "ads by" the applicable company and will contain a link to that
				company's privacy policy.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				Marketing Partners
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We may share, license or sell your information to third parties for various marketing purposes, including their online

				programs. If you would like to be removed from these programs, 
				<a href="http://www.optout-blgl.net/o-lglb-c11-d78ec46a9b45bb143e83500f6709101d">click here</a>

				to age ranges present in your household, whether you own or rent a home, the length of time you have lived at your residence,
				whether you are a mail order buyer or responder, household income, and gender. Further, we may use third party service providers
				to append telephone numbers to other data points we have in our database. We also may use third party service providers to validate
				the data we have in our database.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				Additionally, we may share, license or sell your information to third parties for use in their data validation, enhancement,
				information verification services, and, to the extent permitted by law, individual reference or look-up services.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Mobile Policy</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				This website, websites linking to this website, and websites linked from this website (collectively "We") may make available a service 
				either directly or through third parties by which you can receive messages on your wireless device via short message service 
				("SMS Service"). Your provider's standard data and messaging rates apply to all SMS correspondence. All charges are billed by and 
				payable to your mobile service provider. You represent that you are 18 years of age and the owner or authorized user of the wireless 
				device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. Data obtained from you in 
				connection with this SMS Service may include your name, address, cell phone number, your provider's name, and the date, time, and 
				content of your messages. The use of this information will be in accordance with this Mobile Policy. If fees are charged to your 
				wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier 
				and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own 
				policies. You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to 
				transmit communications over complex networks. We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery 
				is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis. We do not guarantee 
				that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may 
				experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended 
				use of the SMS Service. You may opt out of the SMS Service at any time by replying "STOP", "END", or "QUIT" to the SMS text message you 
				have received. This process impacts only the future delivery of the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for 
				each offering. 
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Governmental Agencies or Other Companies</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may share your information with law enforcement officials or governmental agencies: (1) in response to their
				request; (2) when permitted or required by law; or (3) to establish our compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations,
				or guidelines.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We may store and share your information with third parties for suppression or opt-out purposes.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We also may share your information with third parties when: (1) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential
				fraud or unauthorized transactions; (2) investigating fraud that has already taken place; (3) enforcing or applying existing
				terms and conditions and/or other agreements; (4) protecting the rights, property or safety of our websites, our users or
				others; or (5) responding to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend
				against legal claims.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				In all cases, this information is not provided to these entities or persons for marketing purposes.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Right to Transfer</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Should the Company choose to sell or transfer business assets, it is possible that the information we possess may
				be transferred as part of that transaction. The Company may decide to retain a copy of the information post sale or transfer.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>COMPANY CUSTOMER CHOICES</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>Marketing Communications</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				By completing and submitting a Company registration form, you are consenting to receive marketing communications
				from the Company and its third party marketing partners. If, after you have shared your information with the Company,
				you decide that you do not want to receive marketing communications from the Company and its third party marketing partners,
				you can discontinue the communications by clicking <a href="http://www.optout-blgl.net/o-lglb-c11-d78ec46a9b45bb143e83500f6709101d">here</a> and following
				the opt-out instructions. If you have registered or submitted information under more than one e-mail account, you must submit
				separate unsubscribe requests for each account.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF I HIT A LINK TO ANOTHER SITE FROM A COMPANY WEBSITE?</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Our websites may offer links to other websites. Other websites have their own terms of use and privacy and
				security policies. If you choose to visit one of these sites, you should review the policies that govern that
				particular site.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or submitted to the Company. Other affiliated entities
				of the Company may obtain information independently from transactions and experiences with you or from other sources.
				This Privacy Policy does not pertain to that information.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>WHAT IS THE POLICY WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNICATING WITH CHILDREN?</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				We recognize the unique privacy concerns regarding children. We are committed to carefully protecting
				privacy where children are involved no matter the point of contact. <!--In particular, our intention is to fully
				comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Per COPPA guidelines, -->We do not knowingly collect
				PII from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian is made aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided
				us with PII through any point of contact, please contact us and we will delete the information about the child referenced
				from our files.
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				<strong>SECURITY</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
				There is no such thing as complete security on the Internet or otherwise. The Company uses various security techniques
				on our websites to help protect against the loss, misuse or modification of information we've collected from you. When
				you access your personal information or transmit information to us, that information is stored on servers that we have
				taken steps to protect from unauthorized access or intrusion. While we strive to protect your information, the Company
				cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when
				communicating with the Company, its partners and affiliates.  The transmission of sensitive information collected on our
				site is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
				<br>
				<br>
