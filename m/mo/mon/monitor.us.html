        <h4>I. Google AdWords Conversion</h4>
        <p>Monitis’ website uses Google AdWords, in order to generate attention for our services by using advertisement on third party websites. Based on data generated by such advertisement campaigns, we are able to determine the success rate of our advisement campaigns. Thereby, Monitis tries to provide you with advertisement that is of interest to you, to make its website more interesting, and calculates advertising expenses fairly. Legal basis for such processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Such means of advertisement are delivered by Google AdWords. Provided you clicked on an ad delivered by Google and which redirected you to our website, a cookie is stored on your computer by Google AdWords. These cookies usually expire within 30 days and are not supposed to be used to personally identify a user. In addition to these cookies, analytic values like unique cookie ID, quantity of Ad impressions per storing, last impression and opt-out information (markings that the user does not want to be addressed any further) are usually stored. These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser. If you visit certain pages on our website and provided the cookie stored on your computer has not yet expired, Monitis and Google are able to recognize that you clicked on an ad and were redirected to the Monitis website. Every Google AdWords customer gets a different cookie. Therefore, cookies cannot be tracked across sites by AdWords customers. Monitis does not process personal data by and through the aforementioned advertisement campaigns. Monitis merely receives statistical evaluations from Google. By and through these statistical evaluations, we can plainly see which advertisement campaign was particularly effective. Any additional data generated by use of the advertisement is not forwarded to Monitis; particularly, we cannot identify users through this information. Through the marketing tool, your browser automatically connects to Google’s server. Google has subjected itself to the EU-US Privacy Shield, further information can be obtained under <a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework" target="_blank"> www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework </a>. Please note, that scope and further use of the data processed by Google are beyond Monitis’ control. We thus inform you based on our own knowledge: By integrating AdWords, Google receives information that you visited a particular Monitis website or part thereof, and/or that you clicked on one of our advertisements. If you are registered with one of Google’s services, Google is able to match your visit to your Google account. Google may receive your IP address and/or may store it even if you are not registered with one of Google’s services and/or if you have not been logged in. You may avoid tracking in various ways: </p>
        <p>a) Through a setting of your browser software, particularly, by suppressing third party cookie installation that will prevent that you receive third party ads;</p>
        <p>b) Through deactivating AdWords Cookies, by setting your browser so that cookies from www.googleadservices.com are being blocked; this can be done under <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">www.google.com/settings/ads</a>, however, such settings are deleted if you delete cookies;</p>
        <p>c) Through permanently deactivating cookies in your Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome under www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. Please note that if you deactivate these cookies, you may not be able to use all functionalities of our website. </p>
        <p>Further information on Google’s data privacy can be found under www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy. Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies for interest-based advertising via the advertising network initiative, by following the instructions at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
        <h4>II. Google Remarketing</h4>
        <p>Monitis uses Google Remarketing in addition to AdWords. This is an application that allows us to address you again. After visiting our website and while you are surfing the internet, our advertisement can be displayed to you by and through this application. This is enabled by cookies stored in your browser which track and analyse user behavior on different websites for Google. Google can track your previous visit to our website. According to its own statement, Google does not combine data gathered through remarketing with any personal data Google may have stored about you. Furthermore, pseudonymization is being used as part of remarketing. If you do not want to use the remarketing feature from Google, you can disable it by changing the appropriate settings at <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">http://www.google.com/settings/ads.</a> </p>
        <h4>III. Social Media Plugins</h4>
        <p>Currently, we use social media plugins (“<b>plugins</b>”) from <b>Facebook</b>, <b>Google+</b>, <b>LinkedIn</b> and <b>Twitter</b> (“<b>plugin provider</b>”).</p>
        <p>Monitis uses Facebook plugins on our website which are provided by Facebook Inc. Facebook’s plugins are identifiable by the Facebook logo and/or the "thumbs up” - symbol. Monitis also uses the "+1" button from Google Plus on our website, which is operated by Google Inc.; the plugin is identifiable by the "+1" symbol on a white and colored background. Furthermore, Monitis uses the ”in” button  from LinkedIn, which can be identified by a blue button.  Additionally, Monitis uses the short messaging service Twitter Inc, which can be identified by a button that contains a bird. </p>
        <p>By using plugins, Monitis provides an opportunity to interact with social media and other social media users on its website. Plugins are provided to increase Monitis’ internet presence and make it more interesting to you. Legal basis for use of the plugins is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. </p>
        <p>Every time you visit our website and any part thereof that contains a plugin, the plugin causes your browser to directly connect with the plugin provider’s server. With regard to Facebook and its own statement, IP addresses collected within Germany are apparently anonymized right after collection. </p>
        <p>By activating the plugin, your personal data as described under C. is transmitted to and stored by the plugin provider, likely on a server in the USA. As personal data is collected by and through cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies through security settings of your browser. Please note that data collection and processing are beyond Monitis’ control and we have neither been informed of the entire scope of data collection, purpose of the processing, nor any data retention periods. We have also not been informed if and when data is being deleted. With regard to Google and according to its own statement, Google stores your browsing history when you activate a "+1" button for a period of up to two weeks for system maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. </p>
        <p>Plugin provider store data collected about you as user profiles and use such data for advertisement purposes, market research and/or need based design of their websites. Evaluation of such data (even of users not logged in) is particularly used for need-based advertisements and to notify other users of the same social network of your activities on our website. </p>
