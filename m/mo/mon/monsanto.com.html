<h2>Monsanto Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  Monsanto Company values the privacy of individuals who visit the web sites which
  are operated throughout the world by Monsanto or its subsidiaries and adheres to
  the privacy standards which have been adopted by the countries in which Monsanto
  companies operate. This statement sets forth the important information which individuals
  who visit these sites need to know about how Monsanto companies collect and use
  personal information from web site visitors.</p>
<p>
  In this Privacy Policy, "Monsanto" refers to Monsanto Company and its subsidiaries
  and affiliates, including the business unit of Monsanto that operates the web site
  on which this Privacy Policy is found.
</p>
<div class="padded_box border1">
  Please read this policy carefully. By visiting a Monsanto web site and using the
  services provided on that site, you are indicating your agreement to Monsanto's
  use of your personal information as set out in this Policy.
</div>
<br>
<p>
  This Policy is intended to be in compliance with the applicable privacy laws and
  regulations of each country in which Monsanto operates and from which personally
  identifiable information is collected. To the extent the laws of a country may prohibit
  Monsanto from using and sharing personal information in a way described in this
  Policy, the Policy and Monsanto's practices shall be deemed modified to be consistent
  with such local laws.</p>

<p>
  <a name="what"></a><strong>What Does This Policy Cover?</strong>
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy applies to Monsanto web sites and information collected by and
  through those web sites. It does not apply to any other Monsanto services or dealings
  with users or customers and does not apply to third-party sites which may be linked
  to the Monsanto site.
  <br>
  </p><div class="returnTop">
    <a href="#top">top</a></div>
  <p>
    <a name="collection"></a><strong>Collection of Information</strong>
    <br>
    Monsanto web sites collect personally identifiable information only from individuals
    who voluntarily choose to provide the information through the web site. (In this
    Policy the foregoing information is referred to as "<strong>Personal Information</strong>.")
    That <strong>Personal Information</strong> may be collected in several different ways:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Some sites may permit users to request a "user i.d." and password which can be used
      on future visits to the site. Visitors to the site may be asked to supply their
      name, geographic location and some information about their business or occupation
      or other reason for interest in the site. In addition, some sites permit users to
      supply an e-mail address to sign up for Monsanto newsletters. Other sites may include
      feedback or comment forms whereby users can submit questions or comments to Monsanto.
      (In this Policy, the foregoing information is referred to as "<strong>User Information</strong>.")</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Some sites may permit users to enter into transactions with Monsanto or to take
      advantage of services provided by Monsanto to its customers through that site or
      through its offices around the world. On such sites, users will be required to provide
      detailed information necessary to enable Monsanto to process the transaction and
      to provide the goods or services requested by the visitor. Visitors may be requested
      to provide financial information, including credit card or bank information, in
      connection with such transactions. Visitors may also be asked to provide information
      about the pesticide and other licenses which they hold in order to determine whether
      Monsanto can lawfully sell the products requested by the visitor. (In this Policy,
      the foregoing information is referred to as "<strong>Transactional Information</strong>.")</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Some Monsanto web sites may provide chat rooms or discussion forums where users
      may register and post messages or comments. Participation in such discussion areas
      is entirely voluntary. No information which a user posts in such an area is private,
      inasmuch as it will be accessible to other users of the same area. Thus, any <strong>Personal
        Information</strong> which a user chooses to post in such an area will not be subject
      to this Privacy Policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      From time-to-time our site may request additional information from users by means
      of surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely
      voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose whatever
      additional information may be requested. Information requested through surveys and
      contests may include additional demographic information. (In this Policy, the foregoing
      information is referred to as "<strong>Survey Information</strong>.")</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition to the foregoing <strong>Personal Information</strong>, each site automatically
  logs information about a visitor from the browser used to access the site (e.g.,
  Internet Explorer, Netscape, etc.). This includes information about the I.P. address
  of the visitor, the pages in the site which are visited from that address and the
  web site which the user visited just prior to the Monsanto site. (In this Policy,
  the foregoing information is referred to as "<strong>Visit Information</strong>.") None of
  this <strong>Visit Information</strong> permits personal identification of the individual
  user who is accessing the Monsanto site; thus <strong>Visit Information</strong> is not considered
  <strong>Personal Information</strong> in this Policy. <strong>Visit Information</strong> will be used
  by Monsanto to diagnose problems with its web servers, to administer, design and
  construct its web sites, to track visitor movements on the web sites and gather
  broad demographic information for aggregate use only.

<p>
  <a name="cookies"></a><strong>Cookies</strong>
  <br>
  A cookie is a small data file that web sites commonly write to the site visitor's
  hard drive when a site is visited. A cookie file contains information that can identify
  a return visitor each time he or she visits our site. The data is encrypted for
  added security. Monsanto's web sites may use cookies as a way to measure activity
  and traffic patterns on the site in order to continually improve the visitor's experience.
  Cookies also provide visitors the convenience of not having to log in a password
  more than once on a Monsanto site, thereby saving the visitor time while on our
  site.</p>
<p>
  A browser can be set to warn the users before accepting cookies. Users can choose
  to refuse cookies by turning them off in the browser. Users do not need to have
  cookies turned on to visit our web site, but will need them to use certain customizable
  features of our web site such as automatically displaying local weather and crop
  forecasts, accessing certain areas of our web site, and transacting business on
  our web site.</p>

<p>
  <a name="use"></a><strong>Monsanto's Use of Your Personal Information</strong>
  <br>
  Your <strong>Personal Information</strong> may be used to communicate with you about your
  use of our sites, to let you know about changes to our services or our site or to
  provide services to you or to improve our understanding of what visitors want and
  need to see on the sites. In particular:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>User Information</strong> may be used by Monsanto primarily to enhance the usability
      and friendliness of the Monsanto web sites and to ensure that the information which
      is provided is timely and relevant and meets the needs of our visitors. Monsanto
      may also use the information which visitors voluntarily furnish through these sites
      to provide information and promotional material to persons who have visited the
      Monsanto sites and to process specific requests for information which visitors may
      make. (See <a href="#opting">"Opting In / Opting Out"</a> below if you do not wish
      to receive such materials from Monsanto.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Transactional Information</strong> will be used by Monsanto to process and complete
      the transaction for goods or services requested by the visitor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Survey Information</strong> will be used in a manner similar to <strong>User Information</strong>
      but will be used primarily in aggregate form to provide Monsanto with information
      on customer needs, product design, market demand, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Also, you should know that your <strong>Personal Information</strong>, as well as <strong>Visit Information</strong>
  collected at a Monsanto site, may be used by Monsanto security personnel if deemed
  necessary to protect Monsanto from a threat or other perceived security risk and
  such information may be shared with law enforcement authorities if appropriate.</p>
<div class="returnTop">
  <a href="#top">top</a></div>
<p>
  <a name="sharing"></a><strong>Sharing and Disclosure of Your
    Information</strong>
  <br>
  Monsanto may share Personal Information with others for a number of purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      We may provide contact information to our trade partners, advertisers and other
      interested parties so that they may contact you directly to furnish you information
      about their products and services. (As used in this Policy, "<strong>Trade Partners</strong>"
      means businesses not owned or operated by Monsanto but which provide compatible
      goods or services which may be desired by or potentially useful for visitors to
      the Monsanto web sites.) (See <a href="#opting">"Opting In / Opting Out"</a> below
      if you do not wish to receive such materials from Trade Partners.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We will provide aggregated data about products and services purchased, visitor interests,
      demographics and other information collected from our web site to our Trade Partners,
      advertisers and other interested parties so that they can learn what products and
      services are most popular to our customers. Aggregated data will be in anonymous
      group statistical form and not associated with any individual person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We may use a credit card processing company to bill web site visitors for products
      and services which they request.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We may partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs
      up for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is
      necessary for the third parties to provide these services. These parties will not
      be allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of
      providing these services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We also may share <strong>Personal Information</strong> about visitors to our web sites among
      its corporate affiliates and subsidiary companies for purposes related to the business
      of those affiliates and subsidiaries.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Monsanto may also share <strong>Personal Information</strong> about web site visitors with
  third parties under the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      When you consent to disclosure;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To comply with law, court orders, subpoena or legal process;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To enforce or apply Monsanto's agreements or protect Monsanto and its rights,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      By operation of law, when such <strong>Personal Information</strong> is transferred as a part
      of sale of assets including the assets represented by this site; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In the event that Monsanto, or substantially all of its assets, are acquired outside
      of the ordinary course of business, and such <strong>Personal Information</strong> may be
      one of the transferred assets.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <a name="transfers"></a><strong>Transfers of Information</strong>
  <br>
  Because Monsanto operates from its headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri in the United
  States of America and through subsidiary companies located in many countries around
  the globe, and because its web servers which host its web sites are located at numerous
  locations inside and outside the United States, it is possible that <strong>Personal Information</strong>
  about visitors may be transferred from one country to another. Such transfers will
  only occur in compliance with the applicable local law relevant to the source of
  the information.
</p>
<p>
  When you furnish <strong>Personal Information</strong> to Monsanto through a Monsanto web
  site, you are also giving your consent to a cross-border transfer of that information
  unless you specifically elect not to have the information transferred at the time
  you furnish it to us and inform us of your decision according to the instructions
  on the site through which the information is provided.
</p>
<div class="returnTop">

<p>
  <a name="children"></a><strong>Children and Privacy</strong>
  <br>
  Monsanto does not knowingly collect information from or about children age 13 and
  under.
</p>
<div class="returnTop">
  <a href="#top">top</a></div>
<p>
  <a name="opting"></a><strong>Opting In / Opting Out</strong>
  <br>
  Upon registering at any Monsanto web site which collects <strong>Personal Information</strong>,
  visitors will be given an opportunity to determine whether they wish to receive
  promotional materials from Monsanto or from Trade Partners. The manner and method
  in which a Monsanto site permits users to opt out of receiving such materials will
  be described on the individual site collecting that <strong>Personal Information</strong>.
  If the user would like to "opt out" at a later time, he may do so by following the
  instructions on the site where the original request was made or the instructions
  contained in the e-mail messages delivering such materials to him.</p>
<p>
  Likewise, you may withdraw your consent to the collection or use of your Personal
  Information at any time by sending an email message to <a href="mailto:email.webguru@monsanto.com">
    email.webguru@monsanto.com</a> identifying yourself and describing the <strong>Personal
      Information</strong> which you believe has been collected through this site.
</p>
<div class="returnTop">
  <a href="#top">top</a></div>
<p>
  <a name="correction"></a><strong>Correction/Updating of Personal Information</strong>
  <br>
  Each site which collects Personal Information will provide users with instructions
  regarding correcting or updating that <strong>Personal Information</strong>. Some sites may
  maintain a user account section where visitors can make corrections themselves;
  others may provide an email link or contact information to request us to make those
  changes; generally, user requests for an update of <strong>Personal Information</strong> will
  be honored within a reasonable time after we receive a request. However, no changes
  to personal information will be permitted where the change would result in incorrect
  information or would alter a transaction with us already completed.
</p>
<div class="returnTop">
  <a href="#top">top</a></div>
<p>
  <a name="retention"></a><strong>Retention of Personal Information</strong>
  <br>
  Monsanto will periodically delete Personal Information collected from visitors to
  its web sites if it is no longer needed for any purpose for which the information
  may be used or disclosed under the terms of this Policy.
</p>
<div class="returnTop">

<p>
  <a name="security"></a><strong>Security</strong>
  <br>
  Monsanto takes precautions to protect users' information. Our safeguards include
  technical means and policies and procedures that our staff is trained to follow.
  In any event in which a Monsanto web site is hosted by a third party, these safeguards
  shall also apply. If as a registered user you receive a password, you should keep
  it confidential because it is the key to access to the information held by Monsanto
  about you. If you leave your computer's internet browser running and someone else
  uses your computer, they will be able to access your account; thus, if your computer
  is not physically secure remember to shut down your browser before you leave it.</p>
<p>
  We try to reduce the likelihood of accidental disclosures and unintended access
  and modification of account information, but it is impossible to eliminate this
  possibility completely. When users submit sensitive information via the website,
  their information is protected both on-line and off-line.</p>
<p>
  When an enrollment or order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such
  as credit card number) that information is encrypted and is protected with the Secure
  Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
<p>
  While Monsanto uses SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, it also
  takes steps to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information,
  not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
  Monsanto employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any
  time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the
  importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information
  is protected.
</p>
<div class="returnTop">
  <a href="#top">top</a></div>
<p>
  <strong>Protecting Your Own Privacy</strong>
  <br>
  Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information
  online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information
  can be collected and used by others. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for
  maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.
</p>
<div class="returnTop">
  <a href="#top">top</a></div>
<p>
  <a name="changes"></a><strong>Changes to Policy</strong>
  <br>
  If Monsanto decides to change its privacy policies and practices, we will post those
  changes to our Privacy Policy on our web site in advance of the changes taking effect,
  so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and
  under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use
  personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the
  time it was collected, we will notify users. Users will have a choice as to whether
  or not we use their information in this different manner. We will continue to be
  able to use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information
  was collected.

<p>
  <a name="contact"></a><strong>Contacting Monsanto</strong>
  <br>
  Each Monsanto web site provides a Contact Us section to facilitate feedback from
  site visitors. Please use this facility to notify us if you have any questions,
  concerns or complaints about the manner in which your personal information has been
  collected or handled by Monsanto, or contact Monsanto's offices in your country.
