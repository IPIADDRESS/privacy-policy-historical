				<h2>4. When you put information about yourself on the Website, what do the other users see?</h2>
				<p>To make sure you get to meet as many people as possible, other users get to see your username
					and any information you post on your profile, including photos and videos. Any information
					you choose to provide should reflect how much you want other users to know about you. </p>
				<p>The Company recommends and encourages you (and all users) to think carefully about the
					information you disclose about yourself. The Company does not recommend that you put email
					addresses, URLs, phone numbers, full name, postal address, credit card details, national
					identity numbers, drivers’ license details, or other sensitive information in your profile,
					which is open to abuse and misuse.</p>
				<p>
					Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile. While you
					may voluntarily provide this information to the Company when you create your profile, there
					is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you
					post on the Website may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload
					and choose to tell the Company sensitive information about yourself, you are expressly
					consenting to the Company processing your information and making this public to other users.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you post information about yourself or use the chat system, the amount of personal
					information you share is at your own risk. If you post anything that is inconsistent with
					the terms of use, the Company may terminate your account.

					over your information:
				</p>
				<br>
				<ul>

						b. <b>Disclosure of Your Information for Third-Party Advertising</b> If you do not want
						the Company to share your personal information with unaffiliated or non-agent third
						parties for promotional purposes, you can opt out by changing your email preferences
						in your account settings. You can also always opt out by sending the Company an email
						stating your request to

					<li>
						c. <b>Promotional Offers from the Company</b>. If you do not want to have your email
						address used by the Company to promote its own or third parties’ products or services,
						you can opt out by changing your email preferences in your account settings or by
						sending the Company an email stating your request to
						<a href="mailto: privacy@mofosex.com">privacy@mofosex.com</a>.
						If the Company has sent you a promotional email, you may send the Company a return
						email asking to be omitted from future email distributions or click on the

						collects or that you provide to it to deliver advertisements according to its

					correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to the Company. The
					Company cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your account.
					The Company will not accommodate a request to change information if it believes the change
					would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
					If you delete your user contributions from the Website, copies of your user contributions
					might remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by
					other users of the Website. The Website’s terms of use govern proper access and use of

					your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes, please send an email to
					<a href="mailto:privacy@mofosex.com">privacy@mofosex.com</a>.
					Please be advised that if you opt out from permitting your personal information to be shared,
					you may still receive selected offers directly from the Company in accordance with
					California law.
				</p>
				<h2>11.	Links to Other Websites</h2>
				<p>The Website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that the Company is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those other websites.
