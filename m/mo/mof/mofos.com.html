					<strong>Cookies (or browser cookies).</strong> Cookies are small text files that are stored in your web browser or downloaded to your device when you visit a website.
					Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie.

					Cookies might be used for the following purposes: (1) to enable certain functions; (2) to provide analytics; (3) to store your preferences; and (4) to enable ad delivery and behavioral advertising.

					<p>We currently use the following types of cookies:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="italic-text">Cookies that are strictly necessary:</span> These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website.
							These include, for example, cookies that enable a user to log into the members area of our Website and to check if a user is allowed
							access to a particular service or Content.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="italic-text">Analytical cookies:</span> These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of users and to see how users use and explore our Website.
