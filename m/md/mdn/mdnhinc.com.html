<h3>MDNH Privacy Statement</h3>


<p>
MDNH respects your privacy. Our purpose in collecting information from you is to 
help us provide you with better service, such as notifications about special offers and 
promotions. We will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information 
about you to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in 
this privacy statement. Furthermore, we do not specifically target children under the 
age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect, without parental consent, individually 
identifiable information from such children. 
</p>

<h1>What Information Do We Collect?</h1>
<p>
We may request that an entity applying for an account with MDNH provide us with 
certain personal information (such as its name, email address, etc.) relevant to our 
provision of the various services offered on our site. We do not collect any personal 
information other than that which is specifically and knowingly provided to us. When 
we request information, we explain how it may be used and give you an opportunity 
to request that the information not be used for those purposes. We also give you an 
opportunity to opt out of future communications from us. 
</p>

<h1>Cookies</h1>
<p>
Like most sites, for account management purposes, MDNH uses cookies. Cookies 
are data files stored on your computer that identify you as a unique user. Cookies 
enable us to track user trends, preferences and patterns to better understand our 
user base and to improve the quality of our service. Most browsers permit users to 
refuse cookies or to be notified before a cookie is accepted. You can visit our site 
without using cookies. 
</p>

<h1>Links to Other Sites</h1>
<p>
The MDNH website contains links to other sites. Those sites may send their own 
cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. We are not responsible 
or liable for the privacy practices or content of such sites since we do not control 
them. 
</p>

<h1>With Whom Do We Share Information?</h1>
<p>
MDNH may share non-personal and non-personally identifiable information about 
our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. 
However, we only divulge aggregate information, such as how often the average 
user visits our website.  MDNH may partner with other parties in connection with the 
various services offered on our site, such as credit card processors or email delivery 
services. In such instances, we may share limited personal information that is 
necessary for the third-party to provide its services. These companies are prohibited 
from using this information for any other purpose. 
</p>
<p>
MDNH may also provide personal information when disclosure may be required by 
law (e.g., subpoenas, search warrants and court orders). We may also determine 
that such action is reasonably necessary to protect a party's rights, property, or well-
being. This action may include exchanging information with other companies and 
organizations for the purposes of fraud detection or protection, or in other situations 
involving suspicious or illegal activities. 
</p>

<h1>Business Transfers</h1>
<p>
In the event of a transfer of ownership of MDNH, such as acquisition by or merger 
with another company, a user's personal information will, in most instances, be part 
of the assets transferred. 
</p>

<h1>Consent and Changes to this Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>
By using our site or services, you consent to the collection and use of your 
information as we have outlined in this privacy statement and consent to our Terms 
of Use. Additionally, if you are using any of our services, we may also collect and 
use information in accordance with such service's applicable Terms and Conditions. 
MDNH may decide to change this privacy statement from time to time. If and when 
we do, we will post the changes on this page so that you are always aware of the 
information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 
</p>

<h1>Who Can I Ask If I Have Additional Questions?</h1>
<p>
Feel free to contact us at any time with any questions you may have regarding our 
privacy statement.
</p>
<p>
Effective December 18 2006.
