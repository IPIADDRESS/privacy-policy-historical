                Privacy Policy </h3>
              <p>The Muscular Dystrophy  Association, Inc. (“MDA”) Privacy Policy applies to MDA’s main website at <a href="/">mda.org </a>and all other websites  operated by MDA (collectively, the “MDA&nbsp;Websites”).&nbsp; Our postal  address is 3300 East Sunrise Drive, Tucson,   AZ&nbsp; 85718-3299.&nbsp;  We can be reached via email at <a href="mailto:mda@mdausa.org">mda@mdausa.org</a>,  or by telephone at (520)&nbsp;529-2000.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy includes,  where applicable, a “Notice of Information Practices With Regard to Children”  and “Parental Review of Information.”<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Information  Collection and Use </strong> <br>
                <br>
When you visit an  MDA&nbsp;Website, our server does not automatically capture your domain name or  email address.&nbsp; You may use an MDA&nbsp;Website without disclosing  personal information.<br>
<br>
Some MDA&nbsp;Websites  permit a user to register by creating an account and selecting a unique  password.&nbsp; It is optional for a user to complete a registration  form.&nbsp; If a user chooses to complete one, a user is required to give  certain information (<em>e.g.</em>,  name, age, birth date, postal address, email address, and telephone  number).&nbsp; This information is used to contact the user about the services  on the MDA&nbsp;Website for which they have expressed interest.<br>
<br>
The information we collect  is used to improve the content of the MDA&nbsp;Websites, to advise visitors of  new on-line material, and to provide occasional updates about our research  efforts and what's new at MDA.&nbsp; Information generated through the MDA&nbsp;Websites  is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes, and is only  shared with third parties who provide support for the internal operations of  the MDA&nbsp;Websites and our agents (<em>e.g.</em>,&nbsp;contractors  who provide fulfillment, hosting, and other services or technical support to  the MDA&nbsp;Websites).&nbsp; All such third parties with whom we share  information have agreed to maintain security and integrity of personal  information.<br>
<br>
If you supply us with your  name, address, telephone numbers, and email address, we will use this  information for the service or information you have requested.&nbsp; We collect  the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, aggregate  information on which pages visitors access, and gather information volunteered  by the visitor, such as on-line donation data, survey information, and/or guest  book registrations.&nbsp; Personal data such as your name, address, and payment  information may be collected for the purposes of: responding to a specific  question, advising visitors of new online material, activities and events, and  offering opportunities for contributing to local and national programs and  research initiatives.<br>
<br>
If you make a donation on an  MDA&nbsp;Website, your email address will be entered into our Donor Database.<br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong> <br>
<br>
MDA uses Secure Socket Layer  (“SSL”) encryption to protect credit card and other information submitted  through the MDA&nbsp;Websites.&nbsp; SSL is the industry standard security  protocol.<br>
<br>
<strong>Opt-Out Policy </strong> <br>
<br>
If you do not wish to  receive future email communications from MDA, please let us know by sending an  email to <a href="mailto:remove@mdausa.org">remove@mdausa.org</a> and include  the word “remove” in the subject line.<br>
<br>
If you supply us with your  postal address on-line, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information  about our programs, upcoming events and/or opportunities to support our  efforts.&nbsp; If you do not want to receive such mailings, please send an  email to <a href="mailto:remove@mdausa.org">remove@mdausa.org</a>, include the  words “no mail” in the subject line, and provide us with your exact name and  address.&nbsp; We’ll be sure your name is removed from our mailing list.<br>
<br>
People who supply us with  their telephone numbers on-line may receive a call from us if there are  questions regarding orders placed on-line or donations made via credit card.<br>
<br>
<strong>Notice of  Information Practices With Regard to Children </strong> <br>
<br>
The Children’s Online  Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal  guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from  children under 13 years of age.<br>
<br>
MDA encourages the  interactive nature of online media, and we strive to safeguard the privacy of  individuals who use the MDA&nbsp;Websites.&nbsp; Children under the age of 18  must obtain their parents’ consent before entering any information on any  MDA&nbsp;Website.<br>
<br>
At MDA, it’s our policy to  not ask for any more personal information from any of our visitors, including  children, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to  participate in a the activities offered on an MDA&nbsp;Website.&nbsp;  Generally, MDA limits the identifiable information collected from children to  their name, age, birth date, address, city, state, zip code, email address,  parent’s/guardian’s email address, and telephone number.<br>
<br>
When a child attempts to  register and/or provide personal information on an MDA&nbsp;Website, we require  a parent or legal guardian to: </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Review  our Privacy Policy and agree to the Waiver/Agreement;</li>
                <li>Complete  the registration form;</li>
                <li>Submit  a valid credit card number to verify that the child’s parent or guardian knows  about and authorizes our information practices related to children; and</li>
                <li>Verify  through the use of an email confirmation and second authorization that the  parent or guardian agrees to the Waiver/Agreement and this Privacy Policy. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Once parental notice and  consent has been verified, the information we collect will be treated the same  as information collected from any other user of the MDA&nbsp;Websites.&nbsp;  Without verified parental notice and consent, we will not knowingly collect  personal information of children under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we  have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it.<br>
                <br>
                All identifiable information  about children is used by MDA only in connection with the MDA activity for which  children may register and is not shared with third parties other than those who  provide support for the internal operations of the MDA&nbsp;Websites and our  agents (<em>e.g.</em>,&nbsp;contractors  who provide fulfillment, hosting, and other services or technical support to  the MDA&nbsp;Websites).&nbsp; All such third parties with whom we share  information have agreed to maintain security and integrity of personal  information.<br>
                <br>
  <strong>Parental Review of  Information </strong> <br>
  <br>
                Parents and legal guardians  may review all identifiable information collected about their child, have this  information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use  of their child’s identifiable information by contacting us by letter,  telephone, or email using the contact information provided at the top of this  page.&nbsp; Please be sure to include your email address and a telephone number  where we can reach you.&nbsp; To protect your child's privacy and security, we  will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access  to the personal information that we collect and maintain about your child.</p>
