<p>We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially when conducting business.<br>
This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site (“Visitors”) who visit without<br>

In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.</p>
