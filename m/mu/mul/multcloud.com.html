<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<div>
<p>We at MultCloud understand your concern about how we share, secure
and use the information you have shared with us when you visit the
website <a href="https://www.multcloud.com/">multcloud.com</a> (our
“Website”) and use our services. Our Privacy Policy makes it clear
how that information is handled at our end, and our practices for
collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that
information. We adhere to what we say in this Privacy Policy.
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices
regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not
agree with our policies and practices, you can choose not to use our
Website. By accessing or using our Website, you agree to this
Privacy Policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your
continued use of the Website after we make changes is deemed to be
acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically
for updates.
</p></div>
<div>
<p><b>Notes:</b> After authorization, MultCloud accesses the data in the user's cloud drive (Google Drive, Google Photos, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) without saving the contents. All operations on the user data are based-on the API interface provided by the cloud disk. Therefore, MultCloud plays just as a bridge to connect one cloud storage to another.
</p></div>
<div>
<h4><span>01. </span>INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h4>
<p><b>Customer-Provided Information:</b> To use MultCloud services, you may first download the
MultCloud application (the “App”). To download the App, you will be
requested to provide certain information. We will retain your email
identification provided at the time of sign-up or App download,
email messages we receive from you and the responses given to you by
MultCloud. If you recommend someone to MultCloud, we will use the
provided email address exclusively to send an invitation to that
person.</p>
<p><b>Cookies Information:</b> When you visit MultCloud.com, we send one or more cookies (a text file
including a few alphanumeric characters) to your system to identify
your browser. Cookies we send do not pick-up any of your personal
information. MultCloud sends two types of cookies – persistent
cookies (those that continue to exist in your hard drive even after
closing your browser) and the session cookies (temporary cookies
that get deleted after closing your browser). Persistent cookies are
used by your browser for subsequent visits to MultCloud. Your web
browser can be reset to reject MultCloud cookies or to alert you
when a cookie is sent to the browser. Rejecting the cookies may not
allow all features of our Website to function properly.</p>
<p><b>Log File Information:</b> Your browser sends certain information to our servers every time you access the Website. This information is automatically recorded by
our servers. The server log file includes information such as IP
address, browser type, web request from your browser, referring or
exit pages, number of clicks, landing pages, URLs, pages viewed and
other related information.</p>
<p><b>Clear Gifs Information:</b> When you use the MultCloud Website, we use clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons) to keep track of your online usage pattern and to check
which of the emails sent by us are opened by you. Our Web Beacons do
not collect any of your personal information from your MultCloud
account. Information collected by clear gifs enables us to assess
and improve marketing strategies and make MultCloud serve you in a
better way.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4><span>02. </span>HOW MULTCLOUD USES THE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</h4>
<p><b>Automatically Recorded Information:</b> MultCloud uses automatically recorded information only
for the internal purpose of managing our Website and providing you a better user experience. MultCloud
uses clear gifs, cookies and log
file content to:<br>. Retain information about you so as to
prevent you from re-entering the information every time you view the
web page<br>. Provide personalized information<br>. Keep
track of the efficiency of our service<br>. Analyze the total
number of visitors to the Website and the traffic<br>. Identify
and resolve technical problems reported by customers or engineers
related to IP addresses regulated by a specific web company or an
internet service provider.</p>
<p><b>User-Provided Information:</b> We may convert or combine some personal information of users into
de-identified or aggregated data that does not disclose any of the
personal information of any individual user. We may use any such
de-identified or aggregated data without restriction.<br> <br>
If you purchase products or services, we may transmit your personal
information to payment processors. We may also use your personal
information to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights
arising from any contracts entered into between you and us,
including for billing and collection.<br> <br> Providing
your email address to MultCloud means that you agree to receive
notices at your email address. You can choose not to receive any
type of updates to the service, special offers, newsletters and
other message from MultCloud or alter the frequency of
service-related communications by selecting the unsubscribe link
included at the end of every email that we send to you. Users who
prefer not to receive messages from MultCloud can unsubscribe or
alter mailing priorities by posting a request to us. Unsubscribing
prevents you from obtaining email messages related to special offers
and updates to the service.<br> <br> We will retain your
information for as long as your account is active and for a short
period thereafter in case you choose to reactivate your account. If
you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use
your information to provide you services, you may delete your
account. We may retain and use your information as necessary to
comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to
delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however,
that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers
and backed-up versions might exist after deletion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4><span>03. </span>HOW MULTCLOUD SHARES YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information:</b> We may convert or combine some personal
information of users into de-identified or aggregated data that does
not disclose any of the personal Information of any individual user.
We may disclose any such de-identified or aggregated data without
restriction.<br> <br> We may disclose personal information
to our subsidiaries and affiliates and to any contractors, service
providers and other third parties who need to know such information
to support our permitted uses of personal information. We may
disclose such personal information to a buyer or other successor to
our business in the event of a sale of equity or assets,
reorganization, merger or a similar corporate transaction.<br>
<br> We may also disclose your personal information to comply
with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to
any government or regulatory request and to enforce or apply our
Terms of Use, including for billing and collection purposes, or if
we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the
rights, property, or safety of our customers or others. This
includes exchanging information with other companies and
organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk
reduction.<br> <br> Except as provided above, MultCloud
does not sell, rent or disclose your personally identifiable
information to third parties.<br> <br> <b>Non-Personally Identifiable
Information:</b> We share non-personally identifiable information such
as exit pages, URL’s, number of clicks, platform types and similar
information with third parties to enable them understand how to use
our services.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4><span>04. </span>SOCIAL MEDIA AND WIDGETS</h4>
<p>
If you log onto the Website through Facebook or a similar social
media site, certain information about you will be transferred to the
Website, and the fact that you have logged onto the Website and some
of that transferred information may be available to other users of
the social media site. We will restrict access to any such
transferred information about you to the extent required by the
policies of any such social media site, but all transferred
information will otherwise be subject to the terms of this policy.<br>
<br> You may be able to use social media widgets such as the
Facebook Like button on the Website. These widgets will collect your
IP address and identify which page you are visiting on the Website,
and make your preference information available to third parties. The
information collected by such widgets is controlled by third party
privacy policies.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4><span>05. </span>OTHER WEB SITES LINKED TO MULTCLOUD</h4>
<p>Our Privacy Policy is no longer effective with
respect to information that you disclose on any website linked to

terms, and you should review those terms and policies before
disclosing personal information.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4><span>06. </span>HOW MULTCLOUD PROTECTS USER INFORMATION</h4>
<p> We use technical, physical and managerial
safeguards to maintain the security and reliability of your
information. Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the
Internet is not completely secure. Although we have implemented
security measures that we think are adequate, we cannot guarantee
the security of your personal information transmitted to our
Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own
risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy
settings or security measures contained on the Website, and we
cannot ensure the information transferred to us is not accessed,
changed, disclosed or deleted in case of a security breach of any of
our technical, managerial or physical safeguards. We will notify you
in the manner required by applicable law if your personal
information is compromised by a security breach.</p>
</div>

services are provided from the United States. Certain information
will be stored on servers in multiple other countries on the “cloud”
or other similar distributed hosting platforms. If you are a user
accessing our Website or services from the European Union, Asia or
any other region with laws governing personal data collection, use,
and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please note that
you are transferring your personal information outside your home
jurisdiction, and that by providing your personal information you
are consenting to the transfer of your personal information to the
United States and other jurisdictions as indicated above, and to our
use of your personal information in accordance with this policy.</p>

<h4><span>09. </span>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h4>
<p>With the aim of protecting the privacy of children, MultCloud does
not allow children below the age group of 13 years to register and
use our services. We do not collect any information from children
under 13. We request children under the age of 13 to not send us any
of their personally identifiable information such as email address,
name, contact number or address. If we have obtained personal
information from a child under 13 years of age without parental
consent, then we will delete the acquired information as early as
possible. Users who believe that we hold information about a child
under the age of 13 are requested to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@multcloud.com">support@multcloud.com</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4><span>10. </span>MODIFICATIONS TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
<p>We post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy
on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’
personal information, we will notify you by e-mail to the primary
e-mail address specified in your account. The date the Privacy
Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You
are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date, active and
deliverable e-mail address for you, and for periodically visiting
our Website and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes. For
