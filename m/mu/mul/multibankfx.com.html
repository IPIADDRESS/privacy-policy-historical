			basis; also should any portion of our current policies and practices 
			change you will be sent a revised Privacy Notice in advance, thus 
			providing you with sufficient notice to respond prior to the 
			effective date of the change.<br>

			service, MultibankFX collects information about you from your account

			additional information about our products and services. In order to 
			service your Account, effect your transactions and mail 
			correspondence to you, we provide your personal information to other 
			independent firms that specialize in providing these services. We

			of your information and to use the information only for the purpose 
			for which the disclosure is made.<br>

			Account, or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere 
			to the privacy policies and practices described in this Notice.<br>
			<br>
			We restrict access to nonpublic personal 
			information about you to those employees who need to know that 
			information to provide products or services to you. We maintain 
			physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with 
			federal standards to guard your personal information.<br>
