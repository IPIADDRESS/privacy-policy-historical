Such information may include your first and last name, unique identifier, e-mail address and picture.</p><p class="text justify-text mt mb3"> We will collect billing and payment information which may include your credit card number, billing address, and other payment related information (“Billing Information”). Billing Information is collected and processed by our third-party payment processor operating as our agent (See, Onward Transfers to Third Parties). MURAL does not directly obtain or process any Billing Information.</p><h2>Our Cookie policy</h2><p class="text justify-text mt mb"> MURAL uses cookies and similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data. We use both session-based and persistent cookies.</p><p class="text justify-text mt mb"> Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer or mobile device to us each time you visit our website or use our desktop application.

We urge you to use good judgment and not post Personally-Identifying Information that you do not want other users to know. YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM YOUR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. By posting such information, you consent to the transfer of such information (including any personal information) from your country of origin to the US, and you acknowledge that the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework does not apply to such information (including any personal information).</p><h3 class="subtitle"> Information collected through the Site that IS NOT covered by this Privacy Policy</h3><p class="text justify-text mt mb"> As part of the Services, MURAL collects data from your end users as per your instructions, and may also receive end user data from you.

If you are located outside of the US, please be aware that any information provided to us, including personal information, will be transferred from your country of origin to the US. Except in the case of data transfers under the EU-US Privacy Shield and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework, your decision to provide such data to us, or allow us to collect such data it through our Site or the Services, constitutes your consent to this data transfer.</p><h2>Important Notice for Residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland</h2><p class="text justify-text mt mb"> MURAL complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. MURAL has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability, and the Supplemental Principles (the “Privacy Shield Principles”). If there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. We are committed to applying the Privacy Shield Principles to all personal information received from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway (referred to herein as the “EU”) and Switzerland in reliance upon the Privacy Shield. With regard to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer, for example, we remain liable if our agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" class="link">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a></p><p class="text justify-text mt mb"> MURAL is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.

If your complaint still remains unresolved, then you have the right to invoke binding arbitration by the Privacy Shield Panel upon written notice to MURAL at <a href="mailto:support@mural.co" class="link">support@mural.co</a>.</p><h2>DMCA Policy</h2><p class="text justify-text mt mb"> We take the intellectual property rights of others seriously and require that our Customers and their Authorized Users do the same.
