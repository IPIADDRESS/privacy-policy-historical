choices you have with respect to the information.</p><p>Updates in this version of the Privacy Policy reflect changes in data  protection law. In addition, we have worked to make the Privacy Policy  clearer and more understandable.</p><h3>Applicability Of This Privacy Policy</h3><p></p><p>This Privacy Policy applies to MURAL’s online tools and platform,  including the associated MURAL mobile and desktop applications  (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"), Mural.co (the "<strong>Website</strong>")and  other interactions (e.g.,customer service inquiries,etc.) you may have  with MURAL. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the  Services, website or any other aspect of MURAL’s business.</p><p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or  software that integrates with the Services through the MURAL platform ("<strong>Third Party Services</strong>"),  or any other third party products, services or businesses. In addition,  a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the  Services(the "<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>"), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively,"<strong>Customer Data</strong>"). The organization (e.g.,your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement ("<strong>Customer</strong>") controls their instance of the Services (their "<strong>Workspace</strong>")  and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about  specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the  Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have an account, you can check  with your workspace administrator(s) for contact information. If you  have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created  an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent  the invitation.</p><h3>Information We Collect And Receive</h3><p></p><p>MURAL may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data ("<strong>Other Information</strong>") in a variety of ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Customer Data</strong>. Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer ("<strong>Authorized Users</strong>") routinely submit Customer Data to MURAL when using the Services.</li><li><strong>Other Information.MURAL</strong> also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:</li></ul><p>Workspace and Account Information. To create or update a Workspace  account, you or your Customer (e.g., your employer) supply MURAL with an  email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account  details. your first name, last name, email address, and company name (if  applicable).</p><p>MURAL will collect billing and payment  information which may include your credit card number, billing address,  and other payment related information ("<strong>Billing Information</strong>").  Billing Information is collected and processed by our third-party  payment processor operating as our agent. MURAL does not directly obtain  or process any Billing Information.</p><ol><li>Usage Information.</li><li>Cookie Information. MURALuses cookies and similar technologies in our  Websites and Services that help us collect Other Information. The  Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking  technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about  you via the Website and Services and across other websites and online  services. For more details about how we use these technologies, please  see our <a href="https://mural.co/terms/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>.</li><li>Third Party Services. Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third  Party Services for their Workspace. Typically, Third Party Services are  software that integrate with our Services, and Customer can permit its  Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for their  Workspace. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share  certain information with MURAL. For example, if a cloud storage  application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we  may receive user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with  additional information that the application has elected to make  available to MURAL to facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should  check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services to  understand what data may be disclosed to MURAL. When a Third Party  Service is enabled, MURAL is authorized to connect and access Other  Information made available to MURAL in accordance with our agreement with  the Third Party Provider. For example, you may choose to sign-in using  your Google, or your company identity provider account. By signing-in  using your Third Party account, the Third Party will supply MURAL any  and all information that you have authorized the Third Party to provide  to us. Such information may include your first and last name, unique  identifier, e-mail address and picture. If you would like to know more  about 3rd parties or any other information about them, you can write an  email to <a href="mailto:compliance@mural.co">compliance@mural.co</a>.</li><li>Contact Information. In accordance with the consent process provided by  your device, any contact information that an Authorized User chooses to  import is collected when using the Services.</li><li>Third Party Data. MURAL may receive data about organizations,  industries, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters  related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and  subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own  information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other  Information we collect and might include aggregate level data, such as  which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be  more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email  campaign performed.</li><li>Additional Information Provided to Mural. We receive Other Information  when submitted to our Websites or if you participate in an activity or  event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our social media  accounts or otherwise communicate with MURAL.</li></ol><p>Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to  provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively, "<strong>Information</strong>").  However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some  Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be  unable to provide the Services .</p><h3>How We Use Information</h3><p></p><p>Customer Data will be used by MURAL in accordance with Customer’s  instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement  and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and as required by  applicable law.

This may include keeping your Other Information  after you have deactivated your account for the period of time needed  for MURAL to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits,  comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve  disputes and enforce our agreements.</p><h3>How We Share And Disclose Information</h3><p></p><p>This section describes how MURAL may share and disclose Information.  Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and  disclosure of Information, and MURAL does not control how they or any  other third parties choose to share or disclose Information.</p><ul><li><strong>Customer’s Instructions</strong>.MURAL  will solely share and disclose Customer Data in accordance with a  Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer  Agreement and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and in  compliance with applicable law and legal process.</li><li><strong>Displaying the Services.</strong>When  an Authorized User submits Other Information, it may be displayed to  other Authorized Users in the same or connected Workspaces.

These third parties may, for example, provide virtual  computing and storage services.</li><li><strong>Third Party Services</strong>.Customer  may enable or permit Authorized Users to enable Third Party Services.  When enabled, Mural may share Other Information with Third Party  Services. Third Party Services are not owned or controlled by Mural and  third parties that have been granted access to Other Information may  have their own policies and practices for its collection and use.

Except as expressly  permitted by the Contract or in cases of emergency to avoid death or  physical harm to individuals, MURAL will only disclose Customer Data in  response to valid and binding compulsory legal process. MURAL requires a  search warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (a federal  court or a court of general criminal jurisdiction of a State authorized  by the law of that State to issue search warrants) to disclose Customer  Data. All requests by courts, government agencies, or parties involved  in litigation for Customer Data disclosures should be sent to <a href="mailto:compliance@mural.co">compliance@mural.co</a>.  Requests should be prepared and served in accordance with applicable  law. All requests should be narrow and focused on the specific Customer  Data sought. All requests will be construed narrowly by MURAL, so please  do not submit unnecessarily broad requests. MURAL will notify Customer  before disclosing any of Customer’s Customer Data so that the Customer  may seek protection from such disclosure, unless MURAL is prohibited from  doing so or there is a clear indication of illegal conduct or risk of  harm to people or property associated with the use of such Customer  Data. If MURAL is legally prohibited from notifying Customer prior to  disclosure, MURAL will take reasonable steps to notify Customer of the  demand after the nondisclosure requirement expires. In case of  international requests, MURAL requires that any individual issuing legal  process or legal information requests (e.g., discovery requests,  warrants, or subpoenas) to MURAL properly domesticate the process or  request and serve MURAL in a jurisdiction where it is resident or has a  registered agent to accept service on its behalf. MURAL does not accept  legal process or requests directly from law enforcement entities outside  the U.S. Foreign law enforcement agencies should proceed through a  Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other diplomatic or legal means to  obtain data through a court where Mural is located.</li><li><strong>To enforce our rights, prevent fraud, and for safety.</strong>To  protect and defend the rights, property or safety of MURAL or third  parties, including enforcing contracts or policies, or in connection  with investigating and preventing fraud or security issues.</li><li><strong>With Consent.</strong> MURAL may share Other Information with third parties when we have consent to do so.</li></ul><h3>Security</h3><p></p><p>MURAL implements reasonable and appropriate security measures to  protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized  access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the  risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and comply  with applicable laws and regulations.
