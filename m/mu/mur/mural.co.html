Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third Party Services for their Workspace. Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for their Workspace. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information with MURAL. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to MURALto facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to MURAL. When a Third Party Service is enabled, MURAL is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to MURALin accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider. For example, you may choose to sign-in using your Google, or your company identity provider account. By signing-in using your Third Party account, the Third Party will supply MURAL any and all information that you have authorized the Third Party to provide to us.

MURALrequires a search warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (a federal court or a court of general criminal jurisdiction of a State authorized by the law of that State to issue search warrants) to disclose Customer Data. All requests by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation for Customer Data disclosures should be sent to <a class="fucsia" href="mailto:compliance@mural.co">compliance@mural.co</a>. Requests should be prepared and served in accordance with applicable law. All requests should be narrow and focused on the specific Customer Data sought. All requests will be construed narrowly by MURAL, so please do not submit unnecessarily broad requests. MURALwill notify Customer before disclosing any of Customer’s Customer Data so that the Customer may seek protection from such disclosure, unless MURALis prohibited from doing so or there is a clear indication of illegal conduct or risk of harm to people or property associated with the use of such Customer Data. If MURALis legally prohibited from notifying Customer prior to disclosure, MURALwill take reasonable steps to notify Customer of the demand after the nondisclosure requirement expires. In case of international requests, MURALrequires that any individual issuing legal process or legal information requests (e.g., discovery requests, warrants, or subpoenas) to MURALproperly domesticate the process or request and serve MURALin a jurisdiction where it is resident or has a registered agent to accept service on its behalf. MURAL does not accept legal process or requests directly from law enforcement entities outside the U.S. Foreign law enforcement agencies should proceed through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other diplomatic or legal means to obtain data through a court where Mural is located.</p></li><li class="c16 c15"><p class="text"> <strong>To enforce our rights, prevent fraud, and for safety.</strong>To protect and defend the rights, property or safety of MURAL or third parties, including enforcing contracts or policies, or in connection with investigating and preventing fraud or security issues.</p></li><li class="c10 c15"><p class="text"> <strong>With Consent.</strong> MURAL may share Other Information with third parties when we have consent to do so.</p></li></ul><h3 class="mb2">Security</h3><p class="text"> MURAL implements reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.
