Such information may include your first and last name, unique identifier, e-mail address and picture.</p><p class="text justify-text mt mb3"> We will collect billing and payment information which may include your credit card number, billing address, and other payment related information (“Billing Information”).

MURAL does not directly obtain or process any Billing Information.</p><h2>Our Cookie policy</h2><p class="text justify-text mt mb"> MURAL uses cookies and similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data. We use both session-based and persistent cookies.</p><p class="text justify-text mt mb"> Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer or mobile device to us each time you visit our website or use our desktop application.

YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM YOUR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
