                "Services"). Munky values its users and their concerns 
                about privacy. To this end, Munky engages in consistent information 
                practices and uses its best efforts to make clear disclosures 
                regarding those practices. This Privacy Policy is a part of that

                this Privacy Policy. Munky may decide to change this Privacy Policy 
                from time to time. When we do, we will post any changes here so 
                that you are always informed of the information we collect, how

                some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser 
                functions and the files (pages) users access. For example, Munky's 
                servers collect information about the most frequently searched 
                terms to help provide the most relevant search results, information 
                about usage to check for fraudulent behavior or other abnormalities 
                and to ensure that our Services are technically superior. In addition 
                to the foregoing applications, Munky uses the information (in 
                aggregate form) to better design the Services. </font></font></p>
