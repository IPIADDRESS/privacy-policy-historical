First Posted October 2012.  Last updated.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy outlines important information regarding the use and disclosure of information collected via this Website and the business operations of Mundo Media Corp.
<br><br>
Mundo Media Corp. c.o.b. as "Mundo Media" provides this Privacy Policy to help users, customers and suppliers of the business make an informed decision as to whether to use or continue using the Website and business services of Mundo Media.
<br><br>
PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. "MUNDO MEDIA" DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy applies to  Mundo Media's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Mundo Media on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Website"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to Mundo Media's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. Mundo Media is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications. By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Website Terms of Use. Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide via the Website or through other official Mundo Media contacts remain subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as the Terms of Use and/or other stated policies.
<br><br>
<strong>1. Collection of Information.
<br><br>
1.1 Information Collection By Survey.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media collects information, personal and otherwise, from individuals primarily by having the individuals provide that information directly to Mundo Media through its surveys and other opportunities to share information. Information collection may happen by various methods, including, but not limited to, an individual who transmits or receives a message through a Mundo Media web site by any means including, but not limited to posts and text messages, when an individual supplies a photo, when an individual voluntarily completes a Mundo Media survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by Mundo Media or third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used in this policy, "online" means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Mundo Media or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Mundo Media, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, photo, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Mundo Media may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Mundo Media or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Mundo Media or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Mundo Media.
<br><br>
<strong>1.2 Third Party List Information.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media may collect information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and Mundo Media subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, Mundo Media seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Mundo Media and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.
<br><br>
<strong>1.3 Other Information.</strong>
<br><br>
Other occasions when Mundo Media obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Mundo Media or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Mundo Media's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Mundo Media service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").
<br><br>
<strong>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Mundo Media may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
<br><br>
(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Mundo Media to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Mundo Media's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website.
<br><br>
(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an <img src="x"> programming function — see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Mundo Media to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Mundo Media might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Mundo Media's database, visits the baseball website, Mundo Media receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and Mundo Media would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. Mundo Media may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Mundo Media also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Mundo Media's database.
<br><br>
(c) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including search engine indexing, cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Mundo Media's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Mundo Media strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
<br><br>
<strong>1.5 Outside Information.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of Mundo Media including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
<br><br>
<strong>1.6 Individual Information.</strong>
<br><br>
As used in this policy, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information Mundo Media gathers or receives about individuals such as usage data, file transfer and viewing data.
<br><br>
<strong>1.7 No Information Collected from Children.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media does not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Mundo Media obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Mundo Media has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. Mundo Media has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
<br><br>
<strong>1.8 Log File Information.</strong>
<br><br>
When users log-in to access their account, our servers may automatically record and archive certain information that web-browsers send whenever visiting a Website. These server logs may include information vital to validating the user's authorization to access the account. Information, such as a web request, Internet Protocol (the "IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages viewed and in what order, time spent, the date and time of the request, and other important data is necessary to validate and authorize a user's entry and activity on the Website.
<br><br>
<strong>1.9 Credit Card Information.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Mundo Media. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Mundo Media, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Mundo Media will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing user-initiated purchase transactions, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.
<br><br>
<strong>2. Use of Individual Information.
<br><br>
2.1 Discretion to Use Information.</strong>
<br><br>
THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION AND THAT INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, LICENSING IT TO THIRD PARTIES FOR SECONDARY MARKETING PURPOSES.
<br><br>
The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how Mundo Media currently uses Individual Information, but Mundo Media may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted, Mundo Media may update this policy from time to time. Mundo Media may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, SMS texting, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses. By default, your full name will be used as your screen name.
<br><br>
<strong>2.2 Email.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals. Mundo Media may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all Mundo Media's email lists, a person must send an email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@mundomedia.com">unsubscribe@mundomedia.com</a>.
<br><br>
<strong>2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.</strong>
<br><br>
In certain commercial email messages sent by Mundo Media, an advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to Mundo Media. The "Subject:" line of Mundo Media email messages will usually contain a line provided from the advertiser to Mundo Media.
<br><br>
<strong>2.2(b) Solicited Email.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Website to receive email from Mundo Media or to individuals who have agreed on Third Party websites to receive email from Third Parties such as Mundo Media. Mundo Media does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to Mundo Media's email messages.
<br><br>
<strong>2.3 Targeted Advertising.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual and others. When an individual is using the Internet, Mundo Media uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual with that person's Individual Information, and Mundo Media attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, through indexing of search engines, and otherwise. Mundo Media may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, internet, search engines, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers to individuals and others.
<br><br>
<strong>2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.
<br><br>
<strong>2.5 Mobile Phone SMS Messaging.</strong>
<br><br>
In certain cases, when requested by an individual, Mundo Media or a Third Party may use Individual Information to provide customized content and advertising via SMS messaging to an individual's cell phone. Please note that Mundo Media is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of Third Parties.
<br><br>
<strong>2.6 Use of Technology Information.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of Mundo Media's web sites are most frequently visited. This information helps Mundo Media to better understand the online habits of individuals so that Mundo Media can target advertising and promotions to them.
<br><br>
<strong>2.7 Profiles of Individuals.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained from public databases.
<br><br>
<strong>2.8 Storage of Individual Information.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media stores the Individual Information in a database on Mundo Media computers. Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Mundo Media's control. Notwithstanding such measures, Mundo Media cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent Mundo Media computers from being illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.
<br><br>
<strong>3. Dissemination of Individual Information.</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>3.1 Sale or Transfer to Third Parties.</strong>
<br><br>
MUNDO MEDIA MAY SELL, LICENSE OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN MUNDO MEDIA'S SOLE DISCRETION.
<br><br>
<strong>3.2 Order Fulfillment.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media will transfer Individual Information to Third Parties when necessary to provide a product or service that a person orders from such Third Party while using Mundo Media web sites or when responding to offers provided by Mundo Media.
<br><br>
<strong>3.3 Legal Process.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.
<br><br>
<strong>3.4 Summary Data.</strong>
<br><br>
Mundo Media may sell or transfer non-individualized information, such as summary or aggregated anonymous information about all persons or sub-groups of persons.
<br><br>
<strong>3.5 Access.</strong>
<br><br>
Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to provide an opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or delete such information. Access can be obtained by contacting <a href="mailto:legal@mundomedia.com">legal@mundomedia.com</a>. Mundo Media may also grant advertising clients and email services providers' access to an individual's email address to verify the origin of the Individual Information collected.
<br><br>
<strong>4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons.</strong>
<br><br>
Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together, "Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Website and on the Internet generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to collect information about individuals. Mundo Media does not control Advertisers' use of such technology and Mundo Media has no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about individuals.
<br><br>
