             example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other<br>
             things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the<br>
             number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we also may gather information through<br>
             other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if<br>
             you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to<br>

</p><h3>What we do with the information we collect</h3>
<p></p>
<p align="justify">

             usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or<br>
             what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information<br>
             does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.

             who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information<br>
             only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or<br>
             businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order,<br>
             at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law<br>
             enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
