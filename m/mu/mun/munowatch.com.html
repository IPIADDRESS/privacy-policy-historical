			   <p>
			   This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") of Munowatch discloses the privacy policy for the
			   Service and is hereby incorporated by reference into the Terms of Use.
			   <br>
			   We may collect information about you that is provided by you via the Service to us,

			   </p>
			   
			   <h3>Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
			   <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected on the Service may be used to: (i) send notifications; 
			   (ii) promote the Service and other available services and products to you; (iii) respond to your questions or suggestions; and/or (iv) improve the quality of the Service. We may use your e-mail address, telephone number, SMS address or other contact information to send you notifications about new features, products, services, specials, 
			   promotions or other opportunities available through the Service, or to confirm or improve customer service.</p>
			   <br>
			   <h3>Opt-In and Opt-Out Policy</h3>
 <p>We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information in ways different from what is disclosed in this Privacy Policy unless you specifically elect to make your Personally Identifiable Information available to third parties by selecting to .opt-in. in various places on the Service. Your .opt-in. elections will not, however, require us to share your Personally Identifiable Information with any third parties. Further, you may .opt-out. of any prior elections and of receiving certain types of communications at any time by contacting Customer Service as indicated elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. You agree that such actions, including the deletion of your Personally Identifiable Information and/or your 
 election to opt-out of receiving certain communications, may impact your ability to fully use the Service.</p>
             <h3>Cookies</h3>
			 <p>We may collect certain technical information about your device while you are using the Service. This information may include your IP address, operating system, web browser software and your unique device information. We may automatically assign you a .cookie.

You may be able to choose to not receive a cookie by enabling your device to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie.

In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices, we will post a prominent notice on the Service notifying users of the change, even if it does not affect Personally Identifiable Information already stored in our database. In some cases, when we post such a notice we may also e-mail certain users to notify them of the changes in our privacy practices.
