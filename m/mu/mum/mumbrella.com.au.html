<p><em>Hi Chris,</em></p>
<p><em>It seems we have to increasingly pitch for everything. Even with existing clients, we’re now expected to pitch ideas, competitively, for every project. We’re winning about two out of five of what we’re pitching for. It’s a huge burden on our time and budgets. What is your secret to winning a pitch presentation? How do we make sure our presentations are a knockout?</em></p>

<p><strong>What does a TV series writer actually do?</strong></p>
<p>Create fictional characters and a make-believe world for them to play in. Basically, I’m a liar.</p>

<p>When sound came in,they said it was a gimmick,” says director Baz Luhrmann. “It’s early days, and the [3D] tool is still being explored. But look at what Ang [Lee] did with the beautiful Life of Pi. And Dial M For Murder is just drama in a room.”</p>

Jason Kent 234x350">The Australian government’s support of Hollywood blockbusters is defeating the purpose of building a sustainable local film industry says<b> Jason Kent,&nbsp;</b>in a piece that first appeared in Encore.</em></p>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles for Australian filmmakers is competing with the big budget American studio films. Indeed, this is one of the reasons the government gives for subsidizing Australian films. However, it seems to be at odds with the support given to American films like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.</p>

</em></p>
<p>He readily admits that critics rarely like his films. So it came as no surprise to Baz Luhrmann when The Great Gatsby opened to a critical mauling in the US and, more recently, in Europe, where it opened this year’s Cannes Film Festival.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For many of us who have long read The Guardian online or, in my case, had the print edition delivered once a week, the Australian edition – launched earlier this week – is disappointing. </p>

<p>This week the NSW Government announced plans to invest nearly $1million through Screen NSW to fund four film and TV projects that will generate more than 1,000 jobs and a $25m spend in the state. But how many jobs will really be created, and what are the actual economic benefits for NSW?</p>

<p>Several marketers around the table had been beaten up by The Checkout and were taking it seriously.</p>
<p>In my view, that is a thoroughly good thing.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hi Chris,</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>My friend is an art director for a well-known and respected agency. Her very well-known client is being a real shit, the result being that she’s never out of the office before 9pm. How do you push back on big and important clients like that? How do you manage a challenge of that nature internally and externally? My friend can’t go on like that – she’s on the fast track to burnout. Please help.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>How did you get into journalism?</strong></p>
<p>I studied at Charles Sturt University, Bathurst.</p>
<p><strong>What was your big break?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think there was any single ‘big break’ moment, but when I first moved to the UK after leaving university, I was desperate to land work in a national TV newsroom. I tried every broadcaster – Sky, BBC, ITV and finally got through to Channel 4 News by ringing reception. </p>

<p>Each year, Sydney’s <a href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/">Powerhouse Museum</a> commissions one of Australia’s best design studios to create a poster and accompanying marketing material for the <a href="http://www.sydneydesign.com.au/">Sydney Design</a> festival.</p>
<p>This year they went for a different approach. They put an online call out for entries to design a poster for the 2013 event, offering A$1000 for the winning entry.</p>

<p>I have three related questions for you this issue. I was in a meeting the other day and remarked that because of ‘transparency’, social media, and general people empowerment, many new successful brands have a socio-capitalistic business model at the heart of their business. This allows these businesses to chase unfettered growth as, in general, the more money they make, the more money they give.</p>
