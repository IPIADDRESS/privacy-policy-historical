                    <h2>Privacy policy</h2> <p>We
understand that making purchases online involves a great deal of trust
on your part. We take this trust very seriously, and make it our
highest priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the
personal information you provide to us. Please read the following
policy to learn about our privacy practices.</p> <p> </p> <p>The terms "we", "us", "our" and "Musafir" refer to Universal Travels &amp; Tourism LLC, a limited liability company incorporated in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents. By visiting the Musafir.com website (the "Website"), you are accepting the practices described herein.</p> <h3>What information we collect from you</h3> <ul> <li>In
    General. We receive and store all non-sensitive information you enter on our Website
    or give us in any other way. This includes information that can
    identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last
    name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, but excludes sensitive information such as your credit/debit card number. We also may
    request information about your traveler preferences, including meal
    requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program
    information, and ticketing options. You can choose not to provide
    information to us, but in general some information about you is
    required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or
    services; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey,
    contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other
    transactions on our site.</li> <li>Passenger Information. When
    you make travel or other arrangements for someone else through
    Musafir.com, we will request personal information and travel
    preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of
    other individuals prior to providing Musafir.com with their personal
    information and travel preferences, as any access to view or change
    their information will be available only through your account.</li> <li>Information
    from Other Sources. We also may periodically obtain information about
    you from our business partners and other independent third-party
    sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information
    we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, which
    we use to correct our records and to facilitate proper delivery of
    travel information; and demographic information, which we use to better
    understand your potential purchasing preferences.</li> <li>Automatic
    Information. We automatically collect some information about your
    computer when you visit Musafir.com. For example, we will collect your
    IP address, Web browser software (such as Netscape Navigator or
    Internet Explorer), and referring Website. We also may collect
    information about your online activity, such as trips viewed and
    purchases made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic
    information is to help customize your user experience.</li> <li>Cookies
    and Other Web Technologies. When you visit Musafir.com, we may assign
    your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file). You

    browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie.
    Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from Musafir.com, you
    may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered by
    Musafir.com.</li> <li>Information Collected by Third-Party
    Advertising Companies. Third-party advertisers, such as those we use to
    serve ads on our behalf across the Internet, may use cookies and other
    technologies for several
    purposes, including: to measure the effectiveness of their ads; to
    analyze, modify, and personalize advertising content on Musafir.com and
    other sites; and to provide ads about goods and services we hope will
    be of interest to you. We do not have access to or control over cookies
    or other features they may use, and the information practices of these
    advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You may opt not to have this information collected by select third-party advertisers such as on <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings</a>.</li> </ul> <h3>How we protect your information</h3> <p>We
want you to feel confident about using Musafir.com to plan and purchase
your travel, so we are committed to protecting the information we
collect. We have implemented
appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures
to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For
example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal
information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions.</p> <p>In
addition, we use 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or higher grade encryption when
transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system
and our Website, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to
help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your
information.</p> <p>All payment transactions on our Website  are
processed through a service which uses 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or higher grade encryption when
transmitting your payment details. We do not process and do not store sensitive payment information such as your credit/debit card number, cardholder name,
and expiry date.</p> <p>Despite these measures, we do not warrant that unauthorized access to your
information can never happen and will not be liable for any such
unauthorized access unless caused solely by our gross negligence, in
which event you will be entitled to compensation up to a maximum of the
value of the services purchased by you.</p> <h3>How we use your information</h3> <p>We
use information about you for the following general purposes: to
provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you
with travel confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including

with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to
measure interest in and improve our products, services, and Website;

program you choose to join; to solicit information from you, including
through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot
problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to
enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the

    such as hotel, airline, cruise, or car rental companies, or activity
    providers, who fulfill your purchase. We do not share your email address with these
    suppliers unless they need it to fulfill the travel reservation you
    have made on Musafir.com, and we restrict their use of this information
    to that purpose. We do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or
    disclosure of your other personal information. Therefore, we encourage
    you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose

    prevention. These companies have access to personal information needed
    to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use the
    information for any other purpose.</li> </ul> <h3>We also may share your information:</h3> <ul> <li>In
    response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to
    establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims;
    or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to
    raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li> <li>When
    we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action
    regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and
    defend the rights, property, or safety of Musafir.com, our customers,

information and is used to develop content and services we hope you
will find of interest.</p> <h3>How you can access your information</h3> <p>You

payment of a fee. If you are concerned that any of the information we
hold on you is incorrect please contact us.</p> <h3>Your choices with respect to collection and use of your information</h3> <ul> <li>As
