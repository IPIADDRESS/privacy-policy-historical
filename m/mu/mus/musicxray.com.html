    Other websites accessible through the Services (through hyperlinks, advertisements or otherwise) have their own privacy policies and data collection, use
    and disclosure practices. This Privacy Policy applies to Music Xray services only. We do not exercise control over third party sites or sites that may be

    information from you.

    We do not, even periodically, review the privacy policies or terms of use of third parties and we are not responsible or liable for their privacy
    practices, availability or reliability of the services they may provide, or the accuracy or completeness of their content. Links to or from any third party
    site, whether provided by us or not, do not imply any endorsement, approval, or verification by us of any content available on or the policies of such
    third party sites. By providing access to other websites, Music Xray is not recommending the purchase or sale of products or services provided via such

    of the Services will redirect you to a third party website or Widget, wherein the third party website's privacy policy will apply.

    notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive
    information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained
    your prior consent.

</p>
<p>
    1 We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
</p>
<p>
    2 We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal
    information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy
    Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
</p>
<p>
    3 We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law,
    regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations
    thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or
    safety of Music Xray, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.

    information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular song, for
    example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.
</p>
<p>
    Please contact us at the address noted above for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.
</p>
<p>
    Security Measures -
</p>
<p>
    We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These
    include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard
    against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
</p>
<p>
    We restrict access to personal information to Music Xray employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop
    or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal
    prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
    
            Data integrity
        
</p>
<p>
    Music Xray processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable
    service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the
    personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate,
    complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
</p>
<p>
    When you use Music Xray services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it
    is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask
    individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may
    decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or
    would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In
    any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate
    effort.
</p>
<p>
    Music Xray regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or
    Music Xray's treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at the address noted at the beginning of this
    Policy.
</p>
<p>
    When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Music Xray's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will
    cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of
    personal data that cannot be resolved between Music Xray and an individual.

    that are not sent by us to learn about your use of the Services and other websites and apps in order to present personalized advertisements and other
    messages that may be of interest to you. Music Xray is not responsible for such cookies and tracking software.
