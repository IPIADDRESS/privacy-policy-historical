    information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

    We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular song, for
    example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.
</p>
<p>
    Please contact us at the address noted above for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.

    against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
</p>
<p>
    We restrict access to personal information to Music Xray employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop
    or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal
    prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
    
            Data integrity
        
</p>

    Music Xray processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable
    service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the
    personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate,
    complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
</p>
<p>
    When you use Music Xray services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it
    is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask
    individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may
    decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or
    would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In
    any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate
    effort.
</p>

    Music Xray's treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at the address noted at the beginning of this

    cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of
    personal data that cannot be resolved between Music Xray and an individual.

    <strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>
    California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B. 27, allows individual customers who have provided their personal information to us to request
    information about our disclosure of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be
    submitted to us through the various ways of contact described in the Contact Us page of any of our brands. Within thirty days of receiving such a request,
    we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third party direct marketing purposes during the
    immediately preceding year, along with the names and addresses of those third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We
    reserve the right not to respond to requests submitted in ways other than those specified above.

<p>
    <strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>
</p>
<p>
    ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
    ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL ACTION. YOUR ACCESS AND CONTINUED USE OF
    ANY OF OUR SITES AND APPS SIGNIFIES YOUR EXPLICIT CONSENT TO THIS WAIVER.

    Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent,
    and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we
    will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy
