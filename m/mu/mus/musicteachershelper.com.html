<h1><span>Testimonial</span></h1>
<p>
<span class="lquote qalt">“</span>
Music Teacher's Helper has...given me a clear, written record of which students are consistent in their lesson attendance and payments. Being able to e-mail billing statements has simplified and made money issues more comfortable, especially when dealing with student's parents who are friends and neighbors. I rarely have students ask me about changes in lesson schedules or how much they owe me anymore because they can go online any time to get that information at their convenience, when they are thinking about it.
