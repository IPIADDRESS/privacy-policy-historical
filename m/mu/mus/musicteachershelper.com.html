			Averaging between 40 and 50 students, this site is a time saver...I have tried other sites which do not come close in service, pricing and time saving tools. The site owners are quick to respond to questions and are eager to add tools that would be useful. This is the answer to all my studio concerns, and exciting when told of new things to come. Thank you MUSIC TEACHER'S HELPER!!
