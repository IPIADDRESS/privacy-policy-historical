    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    
        
    
    
    
    
    

    <p><span id="lblCopy">This policy applies to the Global Web site, at the following URLs: www.thisisglobal.com, www.globalradiosales.com and www.globalinteractivesales.com.</span></p>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy please send an email to <a class="external" href="mailto:info@thisisglobal.com" target="_blank">info@thisisglobal.com</a></p>
<p>Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of our site, we gather certain types of information about our users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather and what we do with it.<br></p>
<h3><span id="lblCopy">Information Collected by this Site</span></h3>
<p>We collect two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on the site, for example how many users log into the site on a daily basis).</p>
<h3><span id="lblCopy">Personal Data</span></h3>
<p><span id="lblCopy">Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to the site, for example in registering for electronic newsletters or other membership services, sending email to the site, and registering for contests.<br></span></p>
<h3><span id="lblCopy">Aggregated Information</span></h3>
<p><span id="lblCopy">Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is collected by various methods. For example, we collect IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from a website, its servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to the site. We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration.<br></span></p>
<h3><span id="lblCopy">Use of Cookies</span></h3>
<p><span id="lblCopy">Our site also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major websites write into your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow a website to measure activity on their site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the site without re-registering. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e. during membership registration or a contest), we do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, and that information is not shared with third parties.</span></p>
<p>You may occasionally get cookies from advertisers on the site, which is standard on the Internet. These cookies are outside the control of our site, and are not subject to our privacy policy. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you’d prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site will not function properly if you do.<br></p>
<h3><span id="lblCopy">Use of Information Collected by Our Site</span></h3>
<p>Our site uses both the personal and aggregated information collected for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the site, to customise the content and/or layout of the site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.</p>
<p><span id="lblCopy">We share aggregated information collected from the site with third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes.</span></p>
<p>Personal information collected by this site may be shared with other Global Radio companies or with our agents, such as the company handling our email newsletter mailings. With your permission, we may also share personal information collected on the site with pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes. We will provide users with an opportunity to decline this service when such information is requested from you online. In addition, if you are the winner of a contest your name and company may be posted on the site. Personal information may also be shared only as necessary with third parties who provide technical services to the Site, or host portions of the site, who will not share or otherwise disseminate this information other than as necessary to perform these services.</p>
<p>Also, if you have subscribed to our email newsletter and do not want to receive e-mail newsletters in the future, please discontinue your membership by coming to the website and following the instructions to “unsubscribe” or by emailing websitefeedback@globalradiosales.com with the word STOP in the subject field.</p>
<p>The principle reason for collecting data about you is to improve the service we offer and to try and ensure you get the most from our services.</p>
<p>We may also retain data for security administration, legal, and maintenance purposes. By using the data collected we can provide you with information via e-mail.<br></p>
<h3><span id="lblCopy">Links to Other Sites</span></h3>
<p>It is important to note that this site contains links to other sites, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as our site. For instance, if you click on an advertisement on the site, this will take you away from the site and to an entirely different site. This can include links from advertisers, content providers and partners who may use the sites’ logo and or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect data and make uses of it that this site would not.</p>
<p><span id="lblCopy"><strong>USE OF THIS SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF USE AND PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></span></p>
<p>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by posting a revised privacy policy here.</p>
