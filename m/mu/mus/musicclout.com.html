<br>
<strong>The effective date of this Privacy Policy is February 2011</strong><br><br>

This will help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard your personal information that you provide to us on our website. Music Clout's policy is to respect the privacy of its members. Music Clout will not monitor, edit, or disclose any personal information about you or your account, including its contents, without your prior permission unless Music Clout believes that such action is necessary or if it is required to do so to. <br><br>

Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. Each time you visit the MusicClout.com or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.<br><br>

<strong>Information We Collect From You</strong><br>

On the Site, we place links to other Websites operated by other parties.
