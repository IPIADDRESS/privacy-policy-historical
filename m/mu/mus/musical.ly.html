			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This Privacy Policy describes how
				and when musical.ly collects, uses, and shares your information when
				you use musical.ly, including our mobile applications and websites
				(the "Services"). musical.ly receives your information
				through our mobile applications, websites, email notifications, and
				other interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services
				you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage,
				disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this
				Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or
				supply information from, you authorize musical.ly to use your
				information in the United States and any other country where
				musical.ly operates.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Information Collection and Use</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Creating a musical.ly Account and
				Profile Information: When you create a musical.ly account, you must
				provide access credentials either in the form of an email address
				and password or by authentication using another service, such as
				Facebook and Twitter. You may optionally provide us with additional
				profile information, including a short bio, location, and profile
				picture. If you create your musical.ly account by connecting through
				another service, we may use public information from that connected
				account to help complete your musical.ly profile. You may update or
				modify your profile information and contact information at any time.
				Profile information is available publicly on our Services, such as
				on your profile page.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Contact Information: In addition to
				using your contact information to create your account, we may use
				this information to send you information about our Services, respond
				to your requests and facilitate your use of the Services. We may use
				the contact information (such as your phone number or email address)
				to help connect you with other musical.ly users, even if that
				information is not publicly displayed. Some contact information may
				be required in order to use certain Services.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Finding Friends and Connecting to
				Other Services: Our Services include several features to help
				connect you to the accounts of people you already know. For example,
				you may upload information from your address book or connect your
				musical.ly account to your account on another service such as
				Facebook and Twitter. musical.ly will match the information you
				provide with the contact information of other musical.ly users in
				order to provide and improve the Services, for example by making
				recommendations and routing musical.ly messages. When you connect
				your musical.ly account to other services, you are able to post your
				Content to those services as well.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Content, Following, and other
				Public Information: musical.ly is a music video sharing platform, so
				most of the information you provide us is information that you
				choose to be made public. This includes not only the Content that
				you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was
				posted, but also the accounts you follow, the Content that you like
				or comment on, and other public interactions on the Services. Your
				public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For
				instance, your profile information and public Content are
				immediately delivered to a wide range of users and other services
				that access musical.ly. When you share information or Content via
				the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making
				public.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Links: We may keep track of how you
				interact with links across our Services, including our email
				notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by
				redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help
				improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising,
				and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many
				times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Cookies: Like many websites, we use
				"cookie" technology to collect additional website usage
				data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for
				many parts of our Services such as viewing public videos. A cookie
				is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard
				disk. musical.ly may use both session cookies and persistent cookies
				to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor
				aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our
				Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet
				browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not want cookies
				from musical.ly or other websites, you can instruct your browser, by
				changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you
				before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some
				Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Log Data: Our servers automatically
				record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the
				Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address,
				browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages
				visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs,
				search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you
				interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our
				websites, sign into our Services, view videos hosted by musical.ly,
				or interact with our email notifications. musical.ly uses Log Data
				to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.
				If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or
				remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full
				IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Third-Parties: musical.ly uses a
				variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such
				as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand
				the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These
				third-parties may collect information sent by your browser or mobile
				device, such as cookies, your IP address, or device ID.</p>

				on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Law and Harm: Notwithstanding
				anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose
				your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to
				comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the
				safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical
				issues; or to protect musical.lyâ€™s rights or property. However,
				nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal
				defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's,
				including a government's, request to disclose your information.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Business Transfers: In the event
				that musical.ly is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition,
				reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or
				transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this
				Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the
				new entity.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Non-Private or Non-Personal
				Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated
				or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user
				profile information, public posts, the people you follow or that
				follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link
				(even if only one did).</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Modifying Your Personal Information</p>

				Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access
				or modify the profile information you provided to us and associated
				with your account.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Our Policy Towards Children</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Our Services are not directed to
				persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided
				us with personal information without your consent, please contact
				us. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children
				under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us
				with personal information, we take steps to remove such information
				and terminate the child's account.</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Changes to this Policy</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<br>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
				<a name="_GoBack"></a>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to
				time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of
				your information and will always be at
				http://musical.ly/privacy.html. If we make a change to this policy
				that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an
				email to the email address associated with your account or through
				the Services. By continuing to access or use the Services after
				those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised
