However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.

</p>


<p>
<b>Privacy issues related to children under 13</b> .. Although our visitors arrive from around the world, our network and parent organization is based in the United States. Thus, we adhere to strict privacy policies set forth by the <a class="under" href="http://www.copacommission.org" target="_blank">COPA Commission</a> a congressionally appointed panel,
 mandated by the <a class="under" href="http://www.copacommission.org/commission/original.shtml" target="_blank">Child Online Protection Act</a> which was approved by Congress in October 1998. An excerpt from the final ruling adopted in April, 2000 is below:
 </p>
 <p><i>The rule sets forth several exceptions to the requirement of prior parental consent that
                                                           permit operators to collect a child's e-mail address for certain purposes. For example, no
                                                           consent is required to respond to a one-time request by a child for "homework help" or
                                                           other information. In addition, an operator can enter a child into a contest or send a child
                                                           an online newsletter as long as the parent is given notice of these practices and an
                                                           opportunity to prevent further use of the child's information.
                                                           </i>
                                                           </p>
<p>In aligning our network with this ruling, in situations where we collect personal and/or contact information, we now require the individual to indicate if they are under 13 years of age, and if so, parental permission may be required before further correspondance or activity may occur. Furthermore, personal and contact information 
for those under 13 will not be shared with our member organizations or strategic partners without verifiable parental consent, within reasonable limits as described by the "Safe Harbor" ruling as detailed below:
</p>

<p>
<i>The statute includes a "safe harbor" program for industry groups or others who wish to
                                                           create self-regulatory programs to govern participants' compliance. Commission-approved
                                                           safe harbors will provide Web site operators with the opportunity to tailor compliance
                                                           obligations to their business models with the assurance that if they follow the safe harbor
                                                           they will be in compliance with the rule.
                                                           </i>
                                                           </p>                                                       
                    
                    
<p>
<b>Security issues that are beyond our control</b> .. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat 
areas, that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you 
post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may 
receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are 
solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any 
account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online
