<strong>Linking to other Websites</strong>
<p>Museum Victoria websites may, from time to time, contain links to the websites of other organisations which may be of interest to you. Linked websites are responsible for their own privacy practices and you should check those websites for their respective privacy statements.</p>

<strong>Web Measurement Service used by Museum Victoria</strong>

<p>In common with many websites we may also collect information which tells us about visitors to the Museum Victoria website. For example, we may collect information about the date, time and duration of visits, and which pages of the Museum Victoria website are most commonly accessed. This information is not linked to the identity of visitors.</p>

<strong>Cookies</strong>
<p>As part of the service provided by our web monitoring service provider, Nielsen//NetRatings, Museum Victoria uses third party cookies, left on your machine by Nielsen//NetRatings, to provide us with information to assist in making our website more useable.</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files with a unique identifier that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser, enabling NetRatings’ systems to recognise your preferences and settings.  The cookies collect information such as the number of visits, unique visits, documents viewed, browser type, how the site is navigated, the sections of the website visited and other website usage information.  In using these cookies, none of your personal information is retrieved or recorded by Museum Victoria.</p>

<strong>Web Beacons</strong>
<p>The Nielsen//NetRatings service also uses web beacons (a piece of code sometimes referred to as a '1x1 clear pixel', or 'clear GIF').  This technology gathers more detailed website usage information, which assists in improving our website. The resulting information does not personally identify you.</p>

<strong>Clickstream Data</strong>
<p>Clickstream data is gathered by the Nielsen//NetRatings service. This data is information about the path that a user takes while using the website,  and is used to make the website more useable.  The resulting information provided to Museum Victoria (e.g. the most common path through the website) does not identify individual users.</p>
