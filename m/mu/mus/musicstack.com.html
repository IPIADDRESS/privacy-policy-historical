<b>THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS; ONLINE TRACKING</b><br>

<b>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER AND PRIVACY SHIELD</b><br>
</font>
We are based in the U.S. and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. If you are accessing the Services from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Services may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Data protection laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Services or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your information in the U.S. and other jurisdictions as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If your data is collected in Europe, we will transfer your personal data subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards, such as the Privacy Shield Framework discussed below.
</p><p>
MusicStack complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. MusicStack adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.
</p><p>
MusicStack is subject to the investigatory and enforcement jurisdiction of the United States Federal Trade Commission in complying with its commitments under the Privacy Shield Principles. We hereby affirm our commitment to subject to the Privacy Shield Principles all personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland in reliance on Privacy Shield. This means that MusicStack shall be liable to you for any third party agent to which we transfer your personal data and that processes such personal data in a manner that violates the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can demonstrate that we are not responsible for the resulting damages. MusicStack takes reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is relevant to its intended use and is accurate, complete, and current and retained only as long as needed for an intended or compatible purpose.
</p><p>
Any inquiries or complaints relating to MusicStack's compliance with Privacy Shield, including any requests for access or correction of personal data, may be addressed to our Data Protection Officer set forth in this Privacy Policy. MusicStack will investigate and attempt to resolve any inquiries brought to its attention. MusicStack commits to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more information and to file a complaint. Under limited circumstances, in the event your complaint is not resolved through these channels a binding arbitration option may be available for a Privacy Shield Panel.
</p><p>
If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

<b>SECURITY</b><br>
</font>
MusicStack implements reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security measures to help protect your data from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. MusicStack cannot guarantee the security of the Service's servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
</p><p>

<font size="+1">
<b>POLICY REGARDING CHILDREN</b><br>
</font>

The Services are not intended for use by minor children without the supervison of a responsible adult. MusicStack does not knowingly collect information from minor children. If you are a parent or guardian, and believe we have collected information about your child in violation of this policy, please contact us.
</p><p>

<font size="+1">
<b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>
</font>
We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy in response to changing business circumstances and legal developments.  We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to be informed of how we are collecting and using your information.
</p><p>

<font size="+1">
<b>DATA CONTROLLER</b><br>
</font>
EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as "controllers") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "processors").
</p><p>
MusicStack, located at the address set forth below, generally operates as a processor on behalf of its customers that use the MusicStack's services. The MusicStack customer, the controller, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, such as orders that come to them through our Services.  MusicStack's customer decides what personal data to share on our Services. Please visit the applicable customer's privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.
</p><p>
MusicStack also operates as a controller with respect to certain of its services. For example, MusicStack operates as a controller in connection with personal data collected from visitors through its website. Also, when MusicStack combines personal data from different customers, like many kinds of analytics services or orders of customers, it may do this both as a processor at its customers' instruction and as a controller itself for the purpose of providing services to all of its customers. For example, MusicStack may process and aggregate some of the personal data that a customer shares with MusicStack in order to make that personal data part of another database for one or more other services provided to MusicStack customers.
