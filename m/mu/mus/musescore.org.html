                authorities.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Information We Gather Automatically</h3>
        <p>When you visit this Service, certain non-personally identifying information is recorded automatically by the
            standard operation of our Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its
            operating system, and your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that your Internet service
            provider assigns to your computer whenever you surf the Internet) is gathered in order to facilitate our
            online operations and to assure an efficient online experience for you.&nbsp;If you access our Service from
            a mobile or other device, we may collect information for that device (including operating system, browser,
            type of device) in order to facilitate our mobile operations and to assure an efficient mobile experience
            for you. We may use or share this information for security purposes, to generate group statistics about our
            user community, or as required by law.</p>
        <p>If you access our Service from a social network like Facebook, MuseScore receives certain information about
            you from the social network automatically. The information we receive depends on the Service, the social
            network, and your privacy settings and your friends’ privacy settings on that social network.</p>
        <p>For example, MuseScore may collect and store some or all of the following information provided by the social
            network:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>your first and last name;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>your profile picture or its URL;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>your social network ID number (like your Facebook ID number), which is linked to publicly-available
                information like your name and profile photo;&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>the social network ID numbers and other public data for your friends;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>the login e-mail you provided to that social network when you registered with it;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>your physical location and that of the devices you use to access our Services;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>your gender;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>your birthday and/or age range;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>other publicly-available information on the social network; and/or&nbsp;</li>
            <li>any other information that you or the social networks share with MuseScore.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you access our Service from a social network, you should also read that social network’s Terms of Service
            and Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Among the purposes for which we may use such generally non-personally identifying information is for
            identification purposes in the event of an emergency threatening life or property, or where proper legal
            process allows using such information. For instance, we may use your IP address or other automatically
            recorded information, in cooperation with your Internet provider, to attempt to identify you if it is
            necessary to contact you or to bring legal action against you because you are violating the Terms of Service
            for use for this Service, may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with
            our company's rights or property, or may be adversely affecting other users of this Service or anyone else
            who could be harmed by your activities.</p>
        <h3>Usage Data</h3>
        <p>We may collect data based on your use of the Service AKA telemetry, and we do not associate such telemetry
            data with your name. We use such telemetry data to better understand the usage patterns of our Service and
            the behaviors of our collective audience. At times we may share this information in aggregated anonymous
            form with third parties. Collection of telemetry data based on your use of the Service is done only if you
            permit it. The legal basis for this telemetry data processing is our legitimate interest in improving our
            software and Service.</p>
        <h3>Personal Information You Provide To Us</h3>
        <p>We may request personally identifying information from you in a variety of contexts. For example, you may
            provide such data to us if you: (1) complete an online registration form (e.g., registering for an account,
            various sign-up forms for receiving email newsletters, registering for special offers, entering a
            contest/sweepstakes or responding to a survey); (2) fill out an order form to request information; (3)
            register to participate in message boards and chat rooms (if any) and other community features; or (4)
            purchase any products or services from us or another MuseScore business.&nbsp;Additionally, when you ask for
            help from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the contact information you give them
            (generally, your name and e-mail address), information about your activity on our Services, and your user
            name. We will also store the communications you have with the Customer Service team and any information in
            those communications in order to provide support.</p>
        <p>In such cases, the personally identifying information we request may include your name, email address,
            mailing address and zip code, phone number, and, where appropriate, a valid credit card number with
            expiration date (collectively, "Personal Information"). In addition, we may collect other non-personally
            identifying information such as your date of birth, gender, country of residence, language preference,
            hobbies and other information regarding your interaction with our Service such as your viewing and listening
            habits, preferences and other customized activities in which you participate. Of course, you never have to
            answer any of the questions we ask you (nor choose to view or listen to any multimedia content or otherwise
            interact with our Service), but refusal to do so may limit the products or services we can offer or provide
            to you.</p>
        <p>When you provide Personal Information to us, we may use that data to create a "<strong>Profile</strong>" page
            for you, which will be held in a database using reasonable security measures to protect the data from
            unauthorized access. Others outside Musescore will not be allowed to see the data on your <strong>Profile&nbsp;</strong>page
            except with your consent (see below). If you register to set up an account, you will be able to access your
            <strong>Profile</strong> page at any time in order to update your individual Personal Information listed
            therein (see below under "How Can You Correct or Review Your Personal Information?" for more details).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>How Can Your Personal Information Be Used?</h3>
        <p>Within MuseScore</p>
        <p>When you purchase products or services from MuseScore we will use your Personal Information to fulfill your
            order and for customer service. Many online customers are particularly concerned about their credit card
            information, which we will share only as required by companies involved in your transaction (e.g.,
            fulfillment, billing, mailing, storage or delivery services). We will not share your credit card information
            with any other third party unless that company needs the number for the fulfillment or delivery of your
            order. We do not rent, sell or share credit card information with promotional partners or other third
            parties.</p>
        <p>Your Personal Information may be stored on the MuseScore cloud in order to provide interoperability of the
            Service among your devices.</p>
        <p>MuseScore keeps track of the websites and pages you visit within the Service, what features and content you
            use and how frequently. This information may be used by MuseScore to maintain and improve the content,
            design, usability, and quality of the Service; to improve your user experience; to generate and provide
            statistics regarding use of the Service; to deliver customized content and advertising within the Service to
            users whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area, and to develop new
            products and services.</p>
        <p>We may have links to third party-operated sites that sell or license certain music, videos, or other goods
            mentioned, provided, or promoted on MuseScore. Such third party sites are not operated or controlled by
            MuseScore, and any transactions that you may enter into with such sites will be subject to the privacy and
            security practices of the merchant with which you are transacting. MuseScore and MuseScore are not
            responsible for the privacy and security practices of sites not in our immediate control.</p>
        <p>We may use your Personal Information and other non-personally identifying information we collect to update
            you about our products or services or to contact you about exciting offers of new products or services that
            we believe may be of interest to you. You always have the option to receive fewer or no communications in
            the future from us by opting out. You may opt out by (a) following the instructions included in the specific
            communication you no longer wish to receive, &nbsp;(b) sending an email to privacy@musescore.com and
            explaining how you would like to modify your preferences, or (c) accessing your Profile page and modifying
            how you would like to modify your preferences.</p>
        <p>Finally, without any specific approval from you, we may develop general aggregate data (i.e., data that
            cannot be used to identify specific individuals) about our user community that is partly based on
            information about you and your transactions with MuseScore. For example, hypothetically, you might be one of
            1,000,000 customers between the ages of 25 and 35. We may share such aggregate statistics with other
            MuseScore-related companies without your consent.</p>
        <p>Contest Sponsors</p>
        <p>When you give Personal Information to MuseScore in connection with a contest, we may share that data
            (together with non-personally identifying information you may provide) with the sponsor or sponsors of such
            contest. By entering a contest, you are allowing such sponsor or sponsors to use such Personal Information
            and to contact you in connection with the contest and in accordance with their own privacy
            policies.</p>
        <p>Outside MuseScore</p>
        <p>When you give Personal Information to MuseScore, we may ask you to allow us to share that data (together with
            non-personally identifying information you may provide) with our promotional partners and third-party
            advertisers. In such instances, our general practice is to ask you to "opt-in" to share such data and
            information on, for example, a specific promotion, registration page or sweepstakes. However, in some
            instances, and where law permits, we may ask you to "opt-out" from sharing such data and information with a
            given promotional partner or third party advertiser in connection with a specific promotion, registration
            page or contests. If you prefer, you may give us blanket permission to share your Personal Information with
            all of our promotional partners and third-party advertisers. Conversely, you may also choose not to allow us
            to share your Personal Information with any other companies outside MuseScore.</p>
        <p>If you consent to share your Personal Information with our promotional partners and third-party advertisers,
            you are allowing such parties to use such Personal Information and to contact you in accordance with their
            own privacy policies. You have the option to change your mind and to stop us from further sharing your
            Personal Information with our promotional partners and third-party advertisers by modifying your preferences
            or by contacting privacy@muscsore.com and explaining how you would like to modify your preferences.. We will
            not retrieve any Personal Information shared with our promotional partners and third-party advertisers prior
            to your decision to opt-out. If you wish to limit or discontinue receiving further communications from a
            promotional partner or third-party advertiser, please contact that company directly in the manner indicated
            in its own communications with you.</p>
        <p>Without any specific approval from you, MuseScore may develop general aggregate data (i.e., data that cannot
            be used to identify specific individuals) about you that is partly based on information about you and your
            transactions us. We may share such aggregate statistics with promotional partners and third-party
            advertisers without your consent. </p>
        <p>Finally, we may use your Personal Information in connection with third-party advertisers who serve ads to you
            while visiting an MuseScore Service. &nbsp;These third-party advertisers may use your Personal Information
            (not including any personally identifying information you may provide) in order to generate advertisements
            about goods and services that may be of interest to you. &nbsp;If you would like to know more about this
            practice and to obtain information about how third-party advertisers use your Personal Information to select
            advertisements please click <u>
                <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/">here</a>
            </u>.</p>
        <p>Service Providers</p>
        <p>We may employ third party companies to provide customer support, perform Website-related services (e.g.,
            without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the
            Website's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties may have
            access to your personal information to the extent required to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
            obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
        <p>For Legal Enforcement Purposes</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information, including credit card information, as required by
            law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
            identify, contact or bring legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service for this
            Service or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with our company's
            rights or property, other users of this Service or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.
            Additionally,&nbsp;MuseScore cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to
            enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement
            officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to
            claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of
            MuseScore or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop
            activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical or legally actionable
            activity.</p>
        <p>As an Asset of MuseScore</p>
        <p>If MuseScore becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale or transfer of some or all of its
            assets, your information will be transferred to the acquiring entity. In such a situation, you will be
            provided with notice that a transfer of your information is imminent, and you will be given an opportunity
            to opt-out of the transfer of your information.</p>
        <h3>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h3>

        <p>California law requires that we maintain a separate webpage that allows you to opt out of the sale of your

        <h3>Safeguarding Your Personal Information</h3>
        <p><u>Information security.</u> To safeguard against unauthorized access to personal information by third
            parties, all electronic personal information held by MuseScore is maintained on systems that are protected
            by up-to-date secure network architectures that contain firewalls and intrusion detection devices. The data
            saved in servers is “backed up” (i.e. the data are recorded on separate media) to avoid the consequences of
            any inadvertent erasure, destruction or loss otherwise. The servers are stored in facilities with high
            security, access restricted to unauthorized personnel, fire detection and response systems.</p>
        <p><u>Physical and administrative security.</u> We employ reasonable physical and administrative safeguards to
            protect your personal information. While we will use such efforts, we cannot and will not insure the
            security of your information. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors
            in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond
            our reasonable control.</p>
        <h3>For Parents Concerning the Privacy of Information on Their Children</h3>
        <p>Children under 13 are not allowed to use MuseScore. If you are based in the EEA you may only use MuseScore if
            you are over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your country or
            if verifiable parental consent for your use of MuseScore has been provided to us. If you are a parent and
            you learn that your child is using MuseScore and you don't want them to, <a href="mailto:privacy@musescore.com">please contact us</a>.</p>
        <h3>International Operations and Transfers Out of Switzerland and the EEA</h3>
        <p>MuseScore is a worldwide service. By using MuseScore, you authorize us to transfer and store your information
            outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy. The
            privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be
            the same as in your home country.</p>

        <p>We take additional measures when information is&nbsp;transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA). This
            includes having standard clauses approved by the European Commission in our contracts with parties that
            receive information outside the EEA. We also rely on European Commission adequacy decisions about certain
            countries, as applicable, for data transfers to countries outside the EEA.</p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet Service can place on your computer's hard drive for
            record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using this Service easier by, among other things, saving your
            passwords and preferences for you, keeping track of your shopping cart when you visit an online store or
            other similar purposes, and to help identify you whenever you return to our Service, so you do not need to
            reenter your identification information. Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
            However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note:
            you may need to consult your browser's "Help" area for instructions on how to do that). If you choose to
            disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of this Service will not function
            properly or may perform considerably slower. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set
            personalized preferences or you may have difficulty downloading tablatures, watching videos or utilizing the
            Community Forums. Some of our web pages may contain electronic images (called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel
            GIFs", or "Web Beacons") that allow us to count page views or to access cookies. In general, any electronic
            image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Clear GIF. Typically, though, Clear
            GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files. They are often invisible on a web page, but their presence
            can be detected within many Internet browsers by setting your browser to view web page "sources". Clear GIFs
            are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display
            helpful content. We may also include Clear GIFs in our email products in order to determine information
            about the opening and reading of such emails. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our
            web Service may occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements. Clear GIFs set by MuseScore
            generally are not used to collect, gather, monitor, or share personal information about our users, though
            they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record particular actions. We use Clear GIFs primarily to
            compile aggregated, anonymous statistics about web Service or email product usage.</p>
        <p>Some of the advertisements and other services that appear on our web Service(s) are delivered to you by
            Internet advertising companies.&nbsp;These companies utilize certain technologies including cookies to
            deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our
            sites and other web sites. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having
            this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to provide targeted
            ads, please visit

        </p>
        <h3>Message Boards, Chat Rooms and Instant Messaging</h3>
        <p>If you visit a message board, chat room or utilize an instant messaging service on this Service, if any, you
            are solely responsible for the content of messages you post there. You should be aware that when you
            voluntarily disclose Personal Information (for example, your name, street address, email address, or
            telephone number) on message boards, chat rooms or instant messaging services, that information can be read,
            collected and used by other users of these services and may result in unsolicited messages, both commercial
            and otherwise. You agree that by participating in such online public forums, you will not use such forums
            for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by the MuseScore community guidelines that may be in effect
            from time to time in connection with such service. We reserve the right to terminate your access to this
            Service or to take other protective steps if you violate those terms.</p>
        <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
        <p>We do not endorse and are not responsible for the content or practices of web sites operated by companies
            outside of MuseScore that may be linked to this Service. You should not assume that their privacy policies
            or practices are the same as those followed by our company or by other MuseScore companies. Visitors to any
            such web sites should refer to their respective privacy policies and practices.</p>
        <h3>How to Contact Us</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions or complaints about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at&nbsp;Octaaf

            inquiries about our Privacy Policy, we will use the Personal Information (such as your email address) only
            to respond to your question or comment. However, if your question raises one or more issues that affect our
            promotional partners, we may also share your question with them in order to provide a response.</p>

            responsibility to provide use with accurate personal information about yourself and to inform us of any
            changes. (e.g. new home address or change of name).</p>

        <p>If you demonstrate that the purpose for which the data is being processed in no longer legal or appropriate,
            the data will be deleted, unless the applicable law requires otherwise. You also have the right to request
            the deletion of your personal data for any reason by emailing&nbsp;privacy@musescore.com.</p>

        <h3>Obligations to Data Protection Authorities</h3>

        <p>We will respond diligently and appropriately to requests from DPAs about this Policy or compliance with
            applicable data protection privacy laws and regulations. We will, upon request, provide DPAs with names and
            contact details of the individuals designated to handle this process. With regard to transfers of personal
            information, we will (i) cooperate with inquiries from the DPA responsible for the entity exporting the data
            and (ii) respect its decisions, consistent with applicable law and due process rights. With regard to
            transfers of data to third parties, we will comply with DPAs’ decisions relating to it and cooperate with
            all DPAs in accordance with applicable legislation.</p>
        <h3>Changes in This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify or amend this policy at any time by posting the revised privacy policy on our
            website. If there are changes or additions to this Policy, we will post those changes here or in other
            formats for you to review. Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its
            effective date. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of any modification to the
            Privacy Policy will be deemed to be your agreement to any changed terms.</p>
        <h3>Acceptance of This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>By using this Service, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information by MuseScore in
            accordance with this Policy.</p>
