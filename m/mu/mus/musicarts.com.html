		</a></p><p><a name="types">Many of the services and products on our site are available for viewing without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can surf Music &amp; Arts Center's site and see much of our content anonymously. For instance, you can get store information, and learn about events at musicarts.com, without giving out any personally identifiable information.
		
		</a></p><p><a name="types"><b>Information You Provide</b><br>
		There are some activities on our site where the collection of personally identifiable information is necessary. Those activities include things like entering a contest or sweepstakes, requesting product information at musicarts.com, or otherwise contacting us. When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form. Personally identifiable information may include contact data, such as your name, address, phone and e-mail address; financial data, such as your account or credit card number; and demographic data, such as your zip code, age and income.
		
		</a></p><p><a name="types"><b>Information Collected from You with Technology</b><br>
		The Music &amp; Arts Center site collects some information about you using technology, so it may not be obvious to you that it is being collected. That information may include your IP address, your domain server, your type of computer, your type of web browser, and statistical information regarding the pages that you visit. The Music &amp; Arts Center site uses information collected through technology to make our site more interesting and useful to you. For example, statistical information can help us track which areas of a site are more popular, so that we can better customize content to the interests of our visitors. We will combine information collected using technology with personally identifiable information only to identify a visitor in order to protect our service, site, Guests or others, when required by law, or when needed to help resolve a technical issue a Guest may be having while viewing the site.
		
		</a></p><p><a name="types"><b>What Are Cookies, and How Does Music &amp; Arts Center Use Them?</b><br>
		Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. These pieces of information allow the Web site to remember important information that will make your use of that site more useful. Music &amp; Arts Center and other Internet companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many Music &amp; Arts Center features that make your Web experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.

		<a name="how">
		</a></p><p><a name="how"><b>How does Music &amp; Arts Center use the personally identifiable information that has been collected?</b>
		</a></p><p><a name="how">Music &amp; Arts Center uses personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions. For instance, if you contact us to rent or purchase an item via musicarts.com we use your information to process your order, or if you contact us for help we will use the information to contact you. We use information collected to notify you if you've won a contest. Information we collect may be used to send you e-mail updates and newsletters about our site. We may also use the information you provide to send you Music &amp; Arts Center e-mail promotions and special offers from our third-party sponsors, affiliates and partners. And we use demographic data to customize and tailor your experience on our site, displaying content that we think you might be interested in.

		<a name="does">
		</a></p><p><a name="does"><b>Does Music &amp; Arts Center share information with companies or other organizations not a part of the Music &amp; Arts Center site?</b>
		</a></p><p><a name="does">You are one of the most valuable assets of our business. We aren't in the business of selling information about our Guests. However, if there is a value for our Guests, we will share your information or send you messages on behalf of another company as described below. We will also share information for security reasons.
		
		</a></p><p><a name="does"><b>Companies That Are "Standing in the Shoes" of Music &amp; Arts Center</b><br>
		Sometimes we hire companies to help us deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package. In those instances, we need to share your information with them. These companies are basically "standing in the shoes" of Music &amp; Arts Center, and they are allowed to use the information only to deliver the product or service upon approval of Music &amp; Arts Center only.
		
		</a></p><p><a name="does"><b>Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</b><br>
		On occasion, we may offer promotions--like sweepstakes or free subscriptions--in conjunction with a sponsor. We will share your information with the sponsors if they need it to send you a product, such as a magazine subscription or contest prize. We may share your information with those sponsors so that they can send you other special promotions they offer, but only if you give us your permission to do so, and we will share it only with that specific sponsor. In addition, Music &amp; Arts Center may occasionally send e-mail promotions out to our Guests on behalf of third-party sponsors. In this instance, we don't share your name with the third party--we do the mailing for them. Again, we only send these promotions to you if you've given your permission by signing up for our e-mail list.
		
		</a></p><p><a name="does"><b>Content Partners</b><br>
		On our site we may provide or link to content that is created by a third-party partner Web site. For example, we may link to partner or affiliate sites that offer products or services. In some instances the third-party sites will collect information in order to facilitate the transaction or to make the use of their content more productive and efficient. In these circumstances the information collected may be shared between Music &amp; Arts Center and our third-party sponsors. Third-party sponsors may also have their own privacy policies posted on their Web sites.
		
		</a></p><p><a name="does"><b>Links to Other Outside Web Sites</b><br>
		Our Web site may contain links to outside Web sites with which we do not have affiliation, partnership or other cooperative agreement. Music &amp; Arts Center does not share your personal information with those Web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.
		
		</a></p><p><a name="does"><b>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</b><br>
		Online business is still in a very early stage and is changing and evolving rapidly. As Music &amp; Arts Center continually looks for ways to improve our business, we may buy or sell a company. If we buy or sell a business, the names collected will likely be transferred as a part of the sale. Information about registrants will be used in the aggregate. However, if we buy a business, we will honor the requests that customers made of that business regarding e-mail communications. In the event that we sell a business, we will attempt to be reasonable to ensure that the e-mail communications requests you made of us are honored.
		
		</a></p><p><a name="does"><b>Organizations That Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Guests and Our Sites</b><br>
		We will give out personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Use; or to protect the safety and security of Guests and our site.

		<a name="choices">
		</a></p><p><a name="choices"><b>What choices do I have about Music &amp; Arts Center collecting, using, and sharing my information?</b>
		</a></p><p><a name="choices">It is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally identifiable information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect your information to limit e-mail communications from Music &amp; Arts Center and from our third-party partners. You can request at any time that Music &amp; Arts Center not send future e-mail to you by unsubscribing using the instructions included in each e-mail, or by filling out the remove form (</a><a href="/about/remove.cfm">email list removal</a>), as mentioned above, there are ways to limit the information collected through technology--though some of our features won't work if you decide to do this. For the safety of minors, we request that children under the age of 18 not fill out any personal information on our Web site without first receiving the approval of a parent or guardian.
