<p><strong>Your Privacy Rights – Privacy Policy </strong><br>
</p><p><a href="#financial">Financial Privacy Policy</a></p>
  <a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a><br>
  At Music &amp; Arts we are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and users of our website located at www.musicarts.com (the "Site"). This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") gives you details of our privacy practices, including: (a) what types of information we collect about you; (b) how the information will be used; (c) to whom we disclose the information; and (d) how we safeguard the information. We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time and will provide notice of any major changes by posting notice on the Site.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Your Consent</strong><br>
  <br>
  By providing personal information and/or non-personal information to us through the Site, our stores or through our customer service department in connection with our Site, you are agreeing to let Music &amp; Arts collect and use your information as described in the Privacy Policy. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What Information Do We Collect and Why?</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Registration and Payment Information:</strong> We may ask you to provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis in certain areas of the Site, and you will be required to provide personal information when you make purchases on the Site. The kinds of personal information that we may request may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information (“Personal Information”) and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. All such information will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>IP Addresses and "Cookie" Information:</strong> As is the case with many sites, the Site logs your IP address and uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are downloaded onto your computer when you visit the Site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the guitarcenter.com server whenever you interact with the Site. We use cookies and the information they provide to improve our services and the quality of your experience with the Site. If you prefer not to allow us to collect "cookie" information, you can disable the cookies by turning them off in your browser, although some areas of the Site may not function properly if you do. We do not link IP addresses to your name, email address or other Personal Information. This means that your session will be tracked, but you will not be personally identified. However, certain kinds of cookies allow us to store certain information of yours so you can save time in filling out forms on the Site. We only send this type of cookie to your browser when you have provided your consent for us to save your profile information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Web Beacons and Clear GIFs:</strong> The Site may also use pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses the Site or when you are provided the opportunity to complete surveys, participate in a sweepstakes or other incentives, or open or respond to any newsletter or other email you may have received from the Site. These web beacons or clear GIFs may also be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy. <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <strong>Third-Party Optimization Providers and Cookie Opt-Out:</strong> We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes information provided by the customer (including information necessary to complete transactions), IP addresses, cookie information (and other information that tracks browsing and purchasing history). By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can “opt-out” of our ability to analyze such data by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.omniture.com/optout"><strong>here</strong></a>. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Third Party Advertising Partners:</strong> We may share your personally-identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on our website or offline with us with third-party advertising partners and its service providers in order to deliver to you banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. Our advertising partners will make the data we provide it anonymous when utilized in advertising. To learn more about the use of this information or choose not to have this information used by our third-party advertising partners by opting out, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp"><strong>clicking here</strong></a>.<br>
