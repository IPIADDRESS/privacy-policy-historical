<p>Welcome   to the Musopen (“Musopen”) web site – <a href="http://www.musopen.com" target="_blank">http://www.musopen.com</a> –   and any other services owned or operated by Musopen (the “Musopen   Site”).&nbsp; At Musopen, we strive to make your online experience   with us secure and satisfying. This Privacy   Policy describes and governs what information we gather from you, how   we use that information, and what we do to protect it.&nbsp; By using   the Musopen Site (whether or not you are a registered member), you expressly   consent to the information handling practices described in this Policy.&nbsp;   If you do not want information about you to be used in the manner set   forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Musopen Site.<br></p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This   Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into our <strong><a href="/tos.php">Terms of 
Use</a></strong>.&nbsp;   Your use of the Musopen Site and any personal information you provide   through the Musopen Site are 
subject to this Privacy Policy and the <strong> <a href="/tos.php">Terms of Use</a>,</strong> at all times. &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Changes and Updates to this   Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We   may periodically revise this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Please revisit this   page to stay current with any changes.&nbsp; The most recent version   of this Policy will always be available on the Musopen Site.&nbsp; The   effective date of any changes will be posted at the top of this page.&nbsp;   For changes to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive   on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to   us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change.&nbsp;   Your continued use of the Musopen Site constitutes your agreement to   this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Information   Musopen Collects</strong>&nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musopen   collects two types of data about users:&nbsp; (1) technical data automatically   collected from all visitors (whether registered or non-registered) to   the Musopen Site (“Automatically Collected Data”); and (2) information   that you voluntarily submit to us (described below under “User-Supplied   Information”).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Automatically   Collected Data</strong>:  The   Musopen Site automatically logs non-personally identifiable information   such as Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique user   ID, the content and pages that you access on the Musopen Site and the   dates and times that you visit the Musopen Site.  In addition, if you   come to the Musopen Site via a link from another site, we may also track   the source of that link. &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Information Regarding     “Cookies”</strong>:&nbsp; Like many other websites, the Musopen Site     may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string     of alphanumeric characters – to your computer.&nbsp; Musopen may use     cookies to track user traffic patterns as described above.&nbsp; Musopen     may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; A session     cookie disappears after you close your browser.&nbsp; A persistent cookie     remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser     on subsequent visits to the Musopen Site.&nbsp; Persistent cookies can     be removed.  You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser,     however, some features on the Musopen Site may not function properly     if your cookies are disabled.&nbsp; Please review your web browser “Help”     file to modify your cookie settings.&nbsp; </p>
            </blockquote>
          </ul>
          &nbsp; 
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>User-Supplied   Information</strong>:&nbsp; In using the Musopen Site, for example when you   register with us, if you donate music or money, or if you send us email,   you will provide Musopen with data generally called “personally identifiable”   information (such as your name, home/mobile telephone number or e-mail   address).  If you choose to provide such information, you are giving   Musopen permission to use and store that information consistent with   this policy.&nbsp; Additionally, please know that when you register   or sign in with Musopen, you are not anonymous to us.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In   general, the types and amount of personally identifiable information   we collect may vary depending on the activity.&nbsp; Musopen endeavors   to limit the collection of personally identifiable information to information   we believe is minimally necessary to achieve our stated collection purposes.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>The Way   Musopen Uses Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musopen   uses personally identifiable information to establish and enhance our   relationship with you.&nbsp; Musopen may use the information that you   provide, or that we collect, to operate, maintain, enhance, and deliver   the various features and services found on the Musopen Site (e.g., the   Bid, Donate, Blog, and Forum features); as well as to track user-generated   content and users to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium   Copyright Act and other applicable laws.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musopen   uses all of the information that we collect from users to understand   and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve   the way the Musopen Site works and looks, and to create new features   and functionality.&nbsp; Further, Musopen may use automatically collected   data to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to   re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit Musopen; (b)   monitor your participation in various sections of the Musopen Site;   and (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of   visitors and pages viewed.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We   may use your e-mail address for administrative communications such as   notifying you of major Musopen Site updates, for customer service purposes,   and to send privacy or security-related notices.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>How   Musopen May Disclose Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musopen   does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations   for their <em>marketing </em>or <em>promotional </em> uses.  &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We   may share your personally identifiable information with companies that   provide services to us, including outside vendors, contractors, or agents   who help us manage our financial activities (e.g., for bidding and donation).&nbsp;   Such entities only use your personal information in accordance with   this Privacy Policy and for no other purpose than to provide us with   necessary services.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musopen   may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so   by law or under the good faith belief that such action is necessary   to comply with state and federal laws (including, without limitation,   U.S. copyright or trademark laws) or respond to a court order, subpoena,   judicial or other governmental requirement or warrant in a manner required   by the requesting entity.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musopen   also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information   that we believe, in 
good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our <strong><a href="/html/tos.html">Terms of 
Use</a></strong><strong>;</strong> protect Musopen   from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to initiate, render, bill   and collect for amounts owed to Musopen; to investigate and defend ourselves   against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement   agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Musopen Site;   or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Musopen, our   Users, or others.  &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In   the event that Musopen is acquired by, merged with, or our assets are   transferred to, another entity, such entity may be able to use your   personal information under the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Access to Your Personal   Information</strong> &nbsp;<br>

          </p>
          <p><strong>Children</strong>&nbsp;<br>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musopen   does not knowingly collect or retain personally identifiable information   about persons under 13 years of age.&nbsp; Any person who provides their   personal information to Musopen<strong> </strong> through this website represents that they are 13 years of age or older.&nbsp;   If Musopen learns that personally identifiable information of persons   under the age of 13 years has been collected on the Musopen Site without   verifiable parental consent, then Musopen will take the appropriate   steps to delete this information.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>If you are a parent or guardian   and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a Musopen   Site account, then you may alert Musopen at admin [at] musopen.com and request that Musopen delete that child’s personal information   from its systems.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
