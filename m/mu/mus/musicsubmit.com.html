									MusicSUBMIT LLC ("MusicSUBMIT") has created this
								  web site to provide an online platform for musicians, music
								  promoters and other music professionals. &nbsp;<br>
								  &nbsp;<br>
								  <p>To assist you in using our www. MusicSUBMIT.com web site (the "Web
								  Site" or the "Site"), and to ensure a clear understanding of
								  the relationship arising from your use of our Site, we have
								  created a Privacy Policy and a set of <a href="http://www.musicsubmit.com/public.terms.cfm" target="_blank"><u>Terms
								  and Conditions of Use</u></a>. Our Privacy Policy explains
								  how we protect and treat contact and other information you
								  provide to us through the Site, and our Terms and Conditions
								  of Use govern your use of our Site generally. Please read our
								  Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions of Use carefully
								  - they impose legal obligations on you. By using or accessing
								  our Site, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood
								  these terms and agree to be legally bound by them.</p>
								  
								  <p class="aligncenter"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
								  <p>We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy")
									constitutes the agreement between you and MusicSUBMIT regarding
									your provision, and our collection and use, of contact and
									other information you may provide while using our Site. In
									this Privacy Policy, the words "you" and "your" refer to
									any person accessing the Site, and the words   "we," "us," and "our" refer
									to MusicSUBMIT. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									By using our Site, you consent to this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>1. Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									We have organized the elements of our Privacy Policy in sections.
									If after reading through the Privacy Policy you still have
									questions, please feel free to contact us by clicking on
									the following link: <a href="mailto:support@musicSUBMIT.com" target="_blank"><u>contact
									us</u></a>.&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>&nbsp;<br>
									  2. The Types Of Information You Potentially May Provide</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									This Privacy Policy only applies to information you provide
									to us online while visiting or using our Site. It does not
									apply to information we have obtained offline or through
									other traditional means. Information you may provide in visiting
									or using our Site falls into two broad categories: personally
									identifiable information, and aggregate information. "Personally
									Identifiable Information" is information that can be used
									to identify or contact you, such as your name, phone number,
									email address, or mailing address. "Aggregate Information" is
									information that does not identify you, and may include,
									for example, statistical information concerning the web pages
									on our Site that users most frequent. Our Privacy Policy
									governs both categories of information, as detailed below.   &nbsp;<br>
									<strong>&nbsp;<br>
									  2.1. Information That Identifies You: Personally Identifiable
									  Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									We allow you to decide whether you wish to provide us with
									Personally Identifiable Information. Accordingly, we have
									structured our Web Site so that you may visit our Site, and
									review a range of information about bands, musicians other
									materials relating to the music industry, without revealing
									your identity or providing any Personally Identifying Information.   &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									One of our goals in creating this Web Site, however, is to
									enable bands and musicians to post information about themselves
									and their music (for example, through a MusicSUBMIT Press
									Kit ("MPK™")), and to enable music promoters and other
									music professionals to access such postings and book appearances.
									Therefore, in order to post any such information and book
									appearances, and in order to access certain other materials
									or information from our Site, we ask that you register and
									provide us with contact and other information, as provided
									below. &nbsp;<br>
									<strong>&nbsp;<br>
									  2.1.1. Registration Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									To post information on our Site, and to obtain access to
									certain other materials or information from our Site, we
									ask that you become a registered user. Our registration forms
									will specify the information which you must provide in order
									to enjoy the particular feature, and the information which
									you may, at your option, choose to provide or withhold. Our
									obligations concerning, and permitted uses of, any Personally
									Identifiable Information that you provide during the registration
									process are set out below. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									As indicated above, you may use our Site without registering
									or submitting any information to us. In that case, the only
									information we collect from your visit will be Aggregate
									Information that does not identify you in any way. Our obligations
									concerning, and permitted uses of, Aggregate Information
									are also set out below. &nbsp;<br>
									<strong>&nbsp;<br>
									  2.1.2. Surveys and Questionnaires </strong>&nbsp;<br>
									If you choose to participate in surveys or questionnaires
									which from time to time we may post on the Site, we may ask
									that, in addition to providing your responses, you also provide
									contact and other Personally Identifiable Information. If
									we link, or combine in any way your responses with your Personally
									Identifiable Information, we will treat the combined information
									as Personally Identifiable Information under our Privacy
									Policy, as provided below. If we separate your responses
									from, and they are independent of any Personally Identifiable
									Information, such that a third party reviewing your responses
									would be unable to link the responses to you or your practice,
									the responses will be treated as Aggregate Information under
									our Privacy Policy, again as provided below.   &nbsp;<br>
									<strong>&nbsp;<br>
									  2.1.3. Email And Other Direct Communications</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									From time to time, you may wish to provide us with comments
									and feedback concerning our Site generally. By communicating
									with us for these purposes, you may provide us with your
									email address and other Personally Identifiable Information.
									We will handle such information that you provide in this
									manner in accordance with our Privacy Policy for Personally
									Identifiable Information, set out below. &nbsp;<br>
									<strong>&nbsp;<br>
									  2.2. Information That Does Not Identify You: Aggregate
									  Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									When you browse our Site, the choices you make may provide
									information concerning your interests and concerning the
									appeal and efficacy of associated Site features. For example,
									if you spend time browsing information on events taking place
									in Georgia and Florida, this suggests that you may have an
									interest in events in the Southeast generally. If a number
									of visitors spend time browsing information on events taking
									place in Georgia and Florida, this may suggest that we have
									designed this portion of our Site effectively. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Information concerning our visitors' activities at the Site
									- which pages they visit, and how long they view these pages,
									for example - is Aggregate Information. This information
									does not identify a particular user, but does provide potentially
									useful data concerning our users' preferences and the efficacy
									and interest of our Site's features. The manner in which
									we collect Aggregate Information is set out below.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>2.2.1. Cookies</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									We collect Aggregate Information about your use of our Site
									through cookies and similar Internet technologies.   "Cookies" are
									small text files that a web site can use to recognize repeat
									users, to facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use
									of the site, and to compile aggregate data to improve the
									site and focus advertising. Cookies work as follows: a web
									site will send a cookie to your browser that uniquely associates
									your computer with information stored at the site. Your browser
									places the cookie in its cookies file. When you next access
									that site on your computer, the site recognizes the cookie,
									makes the stored information available, and adds new information
									based on the present visit. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Our cookies do not collect or retain your name or other Personally
									Identifying Information. In addition, no third parties are
									permitted to use cookies created at our Site for their own
									purposes. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									We treat all information collected through cookies and similar
									Internet technologies as Aggregate Information; our obligations
									concerning, and permitted uses of, Aggregate Information
									are set out below. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>2.2.2. Disabling Cookies</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									You may choose not to allow us to collect information through
									cookies. If you wish, you can set your browser software to
									reject cookies, and most browsers provide instructions for
									disabling the cookies feature in their "Help" section. Because
									cookies can be used to provide certain functionality, if
									you disable your browser's cookies feature, certain elements
									of our Site may be unavailable to you. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>2.2.3. IP Addresses </strong>&nbsp;<br>
									A so-called "Internet Protocol" (IP) address is associated
									with your computer's connection to the Internet. We use your
									computer's IP address to maintain contact with you as you
									navigate through our Site. We also may use your computer's
									IP address to provide you with personalized content. Similar
									to cookies, your computer's IP address by itself does not
									identify you personally. We treat IP addresses, therefore,
									as Aggregate Information, as provided below. If your IP address
									is combined by us with any Personally Identifiable Information,
									the combined information will be treated by us as Personally
									Identifiable Information, as set out below.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>2.2.4. Advertisers' Collection Of Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									With Internet technology, it is possible for advertisers,
									as well as site hosts, to collect information through the
									use of cookies and other technologies, such as so-called "clear
									GIF" files. We have no control over, and cannot necessarily
									protect against, the practices or policies of advertisers
									or other web site hosts using such technologies.   &nbsp;<br>
									<strong>&nbsp;<br>
									  3. How We Use The Information You Provide </strong>&nbsp;<br>
									The following section describes how we use the information
									you provide, and details the specific obligations we undertake
									to preserve your privacy. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>3.1. Use of Contact Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									We use Personally Identifiable Information you provide to
									us on our Site to post your MPK™ and other submissions,
									and for other purposes specific to our Site. In connection
									with postings you may request we make on the Site, users
									of our Site shall have access to such information - which
									may include personal information about you. For example,
									your name, address, telephone number and/or email address
									may be included in your MPK™   listing or other submissions
									you request we post for contact purposes.   &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									From time to time, we also may use Personally Identifiable
									Information you give to us to provide you with information
									concerning newsletters, updates, and other materials related
									to the purposes of our Site. We also will use this information
									to respond to questions and comments from you, and to inform
									you of changes to our Privacy Policy or Terms and Conditions
									of Use. You are free at any time to opt-out of receiving
									email and other information we may send to you by following
									the directions set out below. &nbsp;<br>
									<strong>&nbsp;<br>
									  3.2. We Use Aggregate Information Only In Ways That Do
									  Not Identify You</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									To measure our visitors' interest in and use of various areas
									of our Site, and for other purposes set out below, we collect
									Aggregate Information -- which is information that does not
									identify you. Aggregate Information obtained through cookies,
									for example, allows us to monitor how many users are visiting
									our Site, and what areas of the Site present the most interest
									to our users. We are able then to use this information to improve
									the functionality and interest of Site. We also use
									Aggregate Information to prepare statistical and other summary
									analyses of our users' behavior and characteristics. </p>
								  <p>We may share Aggregate Information, and reports based on
									this Information, with third parties unrelated to the Site.
									Rest assured, however, that no such Aggregate Information
									that we provide to third parties will allow anyone to identify
									you, or determine anything personal about you. For example,
									we might report to unrelated third parties (a) the number
									of users of our Site; (b) the materials our users review
									while at our Site; or (c) the fact that "45% of our users
									live on the East Coast." We may charge third parties for
									this information, and we may or may not limit the third parties'
									use of this information. We do not allow third parties to
									attempt to make Aggregate Information personally identifiable
									by, for example, seeking to combine it with other information.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>3.3. Any Information Linked With Your Personal Information
									Is Treated As "Personally Identifiable Information"</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									To advance the goals of our Site, we may link (a) the Personally
									Identifiable Information you have provided; with (b) Aggregate
									Information concerning (for example) your interests and preferences,
									as collected through our cookies. Linking this information
									will allow us to create information packages and services
									that are better tailored to your interests and preferences.
									Among other effects, linking this information may allow us
									generally to improve and focus our Site. If we combine or
									link any information with your Personally Identifiable Information,
									the resulting combination will be treated as Personally Identifiable
									Information under this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, please
									be aware that in such instances, personal information about
									you may be made generally available on the Site in connection
									with postings you may request we make on the Site, as set
									forth above. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>4. How We Safeguard Information We Collect</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									We have put in place security systems designed to prevent
									unauthorized disclosure of information you provide to us.
									These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers
									and others from accessing this information. Due to the nature
									of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however,
									we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information
									you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration
									by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized
									access.   &nbsp;<br>
									<strong>&nbsp;<br>
									  5. How To Obtain Access to Information You Have Provided,
									  And How To Remove Your Information From Our Database</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									We allow you at any time to update, correct, or delete Personally
									Identifiable Information you have provided us. After submitting
									your registration information, you can view and modify this
									information within the "Edit Profile" page of the Site.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									If you request, we will remove your name and other Personally
									Identifiable Information from our databases. Please understand,
									however, that it may be impossible to remove this information
									completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you
									wish to remove your name and other Personally Identifiable
									Information from our database, please contact us.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Because Aggregate Information does not personally identify
									our users, we do not provide our users with access to Aggregate
									Information, and users may not update, revise, or delete
									any Aggregate Information. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>6. Additional General Provisions</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>6.1. Privacy Protection for Children</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									Our Site is not directed at children, and we will not accept
									or request personal information from individuals we know
									to be under 13. If we learn that a child under 13 has provided
									us with Personally Identifiable Information, we will delete
									this information from our databases, in accordance with our
									deletion policy, set out above.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>6.2. Participation in Online Discussions</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									If we include a "chat" or "forum" feature to the Site, you
									may decide to participate in an online discussion. Please
									keep in mind that any information you provide while participating
									in an online chat or forum will be available to all participants.
									These participants, and their transferees, may use Personally
									Identifiable Information and other information you disclose
									in this manner, to contact you and for other purposes. Accordingly,
									if we choose to provide such features at the Site, we ask
									that you participate prudently, as this Privacy Policy will
									not cover the information you disclose in online discussions
									at our Site. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>6.3. Links To Other Web Sites</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									To give you access to other information relating to the music
									industry, from time to time we may include on the Web Site
									certain links to other sites. We provide these links as a
									convenience, and we do not endorse the content or services
									offered by, or the privacy policies in place at, these other
									sites. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Our Privacy Policy covers only information we collect at
									the Site, and other sites to which we link may have privacy
									policies that differ considerably from our Privacy Policy.
									We have structured our Site to make it reasonably clear when
									you leave our Web Site and enter another web site. We encourage
									you to review the privacy policies of each site you visit
									through our links to ensure you are comfortable with these
									policies. We are not responsible for the conduct or policies
									of these third parties. &nbsp;<br>
									<strong>&nbsp;<br>
									  6.4. Court Orders, Subpoenas, And Other Required Disclosures</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									There are two exceptions to our Privacy Policy. First, we
									may disclose Personally Identifiable Information as may be
									required in legal proceedings, or in response to a subpoena,
									court order, or administrative order compelling disclosure.
									Second, in cases involving a threat of imminent harm to you
									or others, we may release such information to prevent or
									mitigate the threat. In any such case, we will seek to limit
									the scope of disclosure, and will disclose only such information
									as is reasonably required to fulfill the purpose of the disclosure. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>6.5. Changes in Our Privacy Policy </strong>&nbsp;<br>
									From time to time we may revise our Privacy Policy. We will
									post these changes here, in our Privacy Policy. Your use
									of our Site following any such change constitutes your agreement
									to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as changed. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>6.6. Relationship to Term of Use</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									In addition to this Privacy Policy, your use of our Site
									is also subject to our Terms and Conditions of Use (our "Terms
									of Use"). The provisions of our Terms of Use are incorporated
									herein, including, without limitation, Sections 12 (Choice
									of Law and Jurisdiction), 14 (Assignment), 17 (Severability),
									18 (Survival) and 19 (Complete Agreement). &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<strong>7. Your Consent</strong>&nbsp;<br>
									By using our Web Site, you consent to our collection and
									use of information, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
									If you do not agree with some, or all of the terms of this
									Privacy Policy, please refrain from becoming a registered
									user, or from visiting our Site. &nbsp;<br>
