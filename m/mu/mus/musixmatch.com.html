					<p><strong>MusiXmatch Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>MusiXmatch Limited (“MusiXmatch” or “we” “our” or “us”) owns or controls, and provides access to the MusiXmatch website, currently located at <a href="http://www.musiXmatch.com">www.musiXmatch.com</a> (the “Website”).</p>
<p>At MusiXmatch, we are fully committed to respecting your privacy and to protecting any information you provide to us. We treat both privacy and security as a priority and make every effort to ensure that all the information provided by you is protected. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is designed to respect and protect the privacy of all visitors to the Website and is intended to inform you about the way that we treat your personal data.</p>
<p>The Policy explains how MusiXmatch collects and uses information. We hope that our candour will remove any concerns you may have and will make visiting the Website a rewarding experience.</p>
<p>If you would like to obtain information about how we may have shared your information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, you may send such requests to us via postal mail at: <strong><em>Musixmatch s.r.l , Viale della Repubblica 11, 40100 , Bologna, Italy</em></strong><em> </em></p>
<p>Although we endeavour to keep you up-to-date on all changes made to the Website, this Policy may be amended from time to time without notice to you. It is your responsibility to read the Policy carefully and review any changes that may have been made.</p>
<p><strong>1. Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>In order to use certain features of the Website, you will need to provide your email or in a near future to register. When registering you will be asked to provide an email address and create a username and password. You may also choose to create a more detailed profile of yourself on the Website by submitting additional personal information. Please note that even if you do not provide any additional personal information to the Website (e.g., by adding it to your user profile), if you choose a username that includes or reveals your name or any other personal information, such information may be available to other users of the Website and to the general public. For purposes of this Policy, the terms “personal information” and “personally identifiable information” shall mean all information provided during your initial registration on the Website and during your creation of a user profile, including, for example, your real name, e-mail address, postal address and other location information, your age, your gender and certain other demographic information or information that may enable online or offline contact with you.</p>
<p><strong>2. Record Collection</strong></p>
<p>From the moment you register and begin using MusiXmatch API, our Profile Navigation software will begin to create and maintain your record collection. This is accomplished by monitoring your activity on the website (i.e. which songs you listen to, which songs you skip, and the degree of difference or similarity you request when you choose to skip a particular song). In addition, your record collection will be affected by other actions you take, such as sending a song recommendation to another user or manually selecting certain songs, albums or artists to be included in your record collection. All of the information that is generated by your activity on the website is fed back into Profile Navigation in order to fine tune your profile so that MusiXmatch can show more of what you like and less of what you don’t like. MusiXmatch also maintains a central database of information collected by the Profile Navigation software (which may include your personal information). MusiXmatch makes some of this information available to third parties to undertake development of new products and services via the API.</p>
<p>MusiXmatch does not process any personally identifiable information related to your record collection and/or profile in any manner other than as described in this Policy. However, please note that, in addition to the third party access that is identified in this Policy, your record collection (including your skipping history) may be viewed by all other users of MusiXmatch (who may include other organisations or representatives of other organisations who have registered as MusiXmatch users) and that they may easily associate this information with your MusiXmatch username. Please see the Statistical Information section below to learn more on this subject and to learn how we log and use information related to your record collection and/or profile in the aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>3. Location-based Information</strong></p>
<p>We keep track of the domains and IP from which people visit MusiXmatch and MusiXMatch API.</p>
<p><strong>4. Browser Information</strong></p>
<p>We collect data regarding the users of MusiXmatch, including: (i) The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer, Geo Information where the user is based This may or may not be associated with a particular Internet Service Provider (ISP); (ii) The referring URL, if any; (iii) The browser software identification (i.e. the brand and version of your browser software).</p>
<p><strong>5. Statistical Information</strong></p>
<p>We log certain information concerning the browsing of lyrics, skipping and music-sharing activities of users and other activities whilst they use the Website, and we may match such information with personally identifiable information concerning such users. For example, it is possible for us to know which lyrics you’re browsing to, which you skip, which you recommend to other users and which you add to your record collection. However, information related to your browsing, skipping and music-sharing activities may be viewed by all other users (who may include other organisations or representatives of other organisations who have registered as MusiXmatch users) in conjunction with your MusiXmatch username and by third parties who have access to this information via MusiXmatch’s API and webservices, as further explained in this Policy.</p>
<p>Please note that we do log and use statistical information in the aggregate. For example, we know the number of users who skip a particular lyrics. From this information we are able to compile statistics in the form of percentages of all users (i.e. 29% of our users skipped lyrics XYZ). We can of course compare the skipping statistics of one song to those of another song. We are also able to perform more sophisticated statistical operations based on the information collected. For example, we can determine the raw number (and associated percentages) of users who browse to one particular song’s lyrics that also listen to other particular songs. From this information, we are able to determine which songs are “neighbours” in terms of overall listener taste and we can see which genres of music tend to be neighbours. As a service, we may supply certain aggregate statistical information to record labels and artists that allow us to stream their music on MusiXmatch in order to help them understand the likes and dislikes of music listeners.</p>
<p><strong>6. Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We will use the email address provided by you when you register to contact you from time to time. This may be for security reasons (so that we can check that you are who you say you are), to ask your opinion about the Website, or it may be to keep you updated on the services currently available on the Website and any changes to those services and those that we intend to launch in the future. We may also use such personal information to send you notices, on behalf of others and ourselves, regarding products and services that we think may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>MusiXmatch may also use your personal information and non-personal information to help MusiXmatch and its commercial partners deliver targeted advertisements, promotions and other similar initiatives to you.</p>
<p>Your username, together with other information concerning your use of the MusiXmatch Website, as well as any personal information included in your user profile, will be made available via MusiXmatch’s open application interface (the “API”).</p>
<p>We will not permit any third parties to contact you directly on an unsolicited basis in relation to their own products or services, unless you have provided your express prior consent when signing up on the Website. You may withdraw your consent by notifying us at info at musixmatch com</p>
<p><strong>7. Message Boards / Chat / Communications With Other Users</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. Software Updates</strong></p>
<p>In order to ensure that MusiXmatch is functioning at its best, from time to time we may ask you to upgrade to a newer version of our software. In addition, we may find it necessary to send you automatic fixes or support files. If we make a modification that materially affects your privacy, we will endeavour to notify you of such modification and we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>9. Links</strong></p>
<p>We may display links to third party sites. However, we cannot control and cannot be held responsible for those other sites, their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users. We advise you to check their terms of use and privacy policies to find out how they are treating your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>10. Data Protection</strong></p>
<p>MusiXmatch complies with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”), including Italian amending legislation and E.U. Directives. Pursuant to the Act, you have the right to be informed of, and to have access to, all of the personally identifiable information we hold about you, and you may do so by visiting your user profile when logged-in to your account on the Website, or by e-mailing us at: info at &nbsp;musixmatch.com</p>
<p>We may store information provided by you on our servers both in the U.S. and in the U.K. See Section 18 below for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>11. MusiXmatch Software and transfers of your information</strong></p>
<p>We may use third-party partners to help operate our Website, and we may share your information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide products or services for or through this Website or for our business (such as Web site or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf).</p>
<p>MusiXmatch operates an ‘open API’ and webservices program, which enables developers and other third parties to freely use statistics and data collected by MusiXmatch to create programs and other interesting services which help develop the MusiXmatch community. More details concerning the API and the information that is made available from it can be found at: <a title="Developer Lyrics API" href="http://developer.musixmatch.com">http://developer.musixmatch.com</a></p>
<p>Certain third party individuals or organizations may have access to your personal information (excluding your email contact information) via MusiXmatch’s API and webservices or as a result of agreements between MusiXmatch and its preferred partners. (However, you should be aware that if you provide your e-mail contact information and/or username directly to any such third parties, they may use your information for their own purposes.) Such partners may use such information for their own purposes, which may be either commercial or non-commercial in nature and which may include targeted advertising or direct marketing. These third parties may be based in the United Kingdom, Italy or elsewhere (including outside of the EEA).</p>
<p>Certain third-party advertisements on the Website may enable you to submit your username and/or other personal information within the advertisement in order to receive information or services provided by third parties. Such advertisements are provided by third parties, and thus, the collection and use of information submitted via the advertisements is by such third parties and is subject to their privacy policies.</p>
<p>MusiXmatch cannot guarantee that all third parties will abide by such restrictions. Of course, you can report any suspected misuse of your personal information to us by emailing us at info at musiXmatch.com&nbsp;and we will endeavour to investigate your claim. Where we deem it appropriate, we will take appropriate action against such third party, which may include terminating their access to personal information.</p>

If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@musixmatch.com">i</a>nfo at musixmatch.com&nbsp;with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.</p>
<p><strong>15. MusiXmatch Policy for Young People</strong></p>
<p>Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use the Website and must not attempt to register with MusiXmatch and/or submit any personal information to us. We don’t knowingly collect personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact us at info at musixmatch.com&nbsp;and we will delete all relevant information.</p>
<p>We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 17 should not send any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet (including to us) without asking their parents/legal guardians for permission beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>16. Legally-Compelled Disclosures</strong></p>
<p>We believe in privacy and therefore will take all reasonable measures to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains private. However, in the event that we are required to disclose personally identifiable information by a court, the police or other law enforcement bodies for their investigations, regulation or other governmental authority we will make such a disclosure without being in violation of this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>17. Business Transitions</strong></p>
<p>If MusiXmatch is acquired by another company or sells all or a portion of its assets to another company, or in the event of a merger, it is likely that user information will be a part of the assets transferred. If as a result of such a business transition information is to be collected, used or disclosed in a manner or for a purpose different from that stated above, MusiXmatch will endeavour to notify all users of such changes beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>18. Consent</strong></p>
<p>By disclosing any information to MusiXmatch through the Website and by using the MusiXmatch Website as a registered user, you are consenting to the collection, storage and use of your personal information by MusiXmatch as set out in this Policy and the Terms and Conditions, and you understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories. If you do not consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories, then you should not use the Website as a registered user, which means that many features will be unavailable to you.</p>
<p>When you give your personally identifiable information to MusiXmatch, it may be used by MusiXmatch and its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries for the purposes of, for example, providing you services and sending you correspondence, and additionally may be transferred to entities other than MusiXmatch’s affiliates, which entities may be located in countries outside the EEA, including the United States. Each of these countries has different privacy laws that afford varying levels of protection for your personally identifiable information, and such laws may not be as comprehensive as those that exist in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). By registering with MusiXmatch, you consent to MusiXmatch’s and its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries’ transmission to, and processing of your information in, any jurisdiction, in accordance with its Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>19. Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>If MusiXmatch makes any changes to this Policy these changes will be detailed on this page in order to ensure that you are fully aware of what information is collected, how it is used and under what circumstances it will be disclosed. If you are concerned about how your information is collected, used or disclosed, you should periodically check back at this page. If you have any specific concerns not addressed in the Policy, please contact us using the feedback page on the website.</p>
<p>If you decide that you do not want your personal information to be used in the way described in this Policy, you can send us a notice that you wish to withdraw your consent as set out above by emailing info at musixmatch.com. Because the MusiXmatch community relies on users sharing information, withdrawing your consent will mean that you are not able to receive the full benefits of MusiXmatch’s service as a user. Additionally, if you do not provide your consent, or if you withdraw your consent, you should not use the Website as a registered user, which means that many features will be unavailable to you.</p>
<p><strong>20. Effective Date</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective from July 11, 2010</p>
