        <h3>PURPOSE OF OUR POLICY</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Milanote Pty Ltd ABN 81 609 368 443 (<strong>we</strong>,            <strong>us</strong> or <strong>our</strong>) has adopted this
                Privacy Policy to ensure that we have standards in place to protect
                the Personal Information that we collect about individuals that is
                necessary and incidental to:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Providing the system and services that we offer; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The normal day-to-day operations of our business.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                This Privacy Policy follows the standards of both:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The Australian Privacy Principles set by the Australian
                        Government for the handling of Personal Information under the                <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth) (<strong>Privacy Act</strong>);
                        and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The regulations and principles set by the European Union’s
                        General Data Protection Regulation (<strong>GDPR</strong>) for
                        the handling of Personal Data.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                By publishing this Privacy Policy we aim to make it easy for our
                customers and the public to understand what Personal Information we
                collect and store, why we do so, how we receive and/or obtain that
                information, and the rights an individual has with respect to their
                Personal Information in our possession.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>WHO AND WHAT THIS POLICY APPLIES TO</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Our Privacy Policy deals with how we handle “personal information”
                and “personal data” as it is defined in the Privacy Act and the
                GDPR respectively (<strong>Personal Information</strong>).
            </li>
            <li>
                We handle Personal Information in our own right and also for and on
                behalf of our customers and users.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect about
                businesses or companies, however it does apply to information about
                the people in those businesses or companies that we store.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Privacy Policy applies to all forms of information, physical
                and digital, whether collected or stored electronically or in
                hardcopy.
            </li>
            <li>
                If, at any time, an individual provides Personal Information or
                other information about someone other than himself or herself, the
                individual warrants that they have that person's consent to provide
                such information for the purpose specified.
            </li>
            <li>
                We consider the protection of privacy of children very important.
                We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the
                age of 16 without obtaining parental consent. If an individual is
                under 16 years of age, then they should not use or access the
                service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that Personal
                Information has been collected on the service from persons under 16
                years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will
                take the appropriate steps to delete such information.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In the course of business it is necessary for us to collect
                Personal Information. This information allows us to identify who an
                individual is for the purposes of our business, share Personal
                Information when asked of us, contact the individual in the
                ordinary course of business and transact with the individual.
                Without limitation, the type of information we may collect is:
                <ol>
                    <li>

                        information defined as “Personal Information” in the Privacy
                        Act that allows us to identify who the individual is;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Contact Information.</strong>

                        residential, business and postal address and other information
                        that allows us to contact the individual;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Financial Information.</strong>
                        We may collect financial information related to an individual
                        such as any bank or credit card details used to transact with
                        us and other information that allows us to transact with the
                        individual and/or provide them with our services;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Technical Information.</strong>
                        We may collect the IP Addresses of users accessing our systems,
                        the actions of users on our website and other digital
                        information created by an individual’s use of our online
                        systems
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Statistical Information.</strong>
                        We may collect information about an individual’s online and
                        offline preferences, habits, movements, trends, decisions,
                        associations, memberships, finances, purchases and other
                        information for statistical purposes; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Information an individual sends us.</strong>
                        We may collect any personal correspondence that an individual
                        sends us, or that is sent to us by others about the
                        individual’s activities.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                We may collect other Personal Information about an individual,
                which we will maintain in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                We may also collect non-Personal Information about an individual
                such as information regarding their computer, network and browser.
                Where non-Personal Information is collected the Australian Privacy
                Principles and the GDPR do not apply.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Most information will be collected in association with an
                individual’s use of Milanote, an enquiry about Milanote or
                generally dealing with us. However we may also receive Personal
                Information from sources such as advertising, an individual’s own
                promotions, public records, mailing lists, contractors, staff,
                recruitment agencies and our business partners. In particular,
                information is likely to be collected as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Registrations/Subscriptions.</strong>
                        When an individual registers or subscribes for a service,
                        account, connection or other process whereby they enter
                        Personal Information details in order to receive or access
                        something, including a transaction;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sharing with other Users.</strong>
                        When an individual provides Personal Information to other users
                        of the website or service;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Supply. </strong>
                        When an individual supplies us with goods or services;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Contact.</strong>
                        When an individual contacts us in any way;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Access. </strong>
                        When an individual accesses us physically we may require them
                        to provide us with details for us to permit them such access.
                        When an individual accesses us through the internet we may
                        collect information using cookies (if relevant – an individual
                        can adjust their browser’s setting to accept or reject cookies)
                        or analytical services; and/or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pixel Tags. </strong>
                        Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format
                        customers can read and they tell us whether mail has been
                        opened.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                As there are many circumstances in which we may collect information
                both electronically and physically, we will endeavour to ensure
                that an individual is always aware of when their Personal
                Information is being collected.
            </li>
            <li>
                Where we obtain Personal Information without an individual’s
                knowledge (such as by accidental acquisition from a client) we will
                either delete/destroy the information, or inform the individual
                that we hold such information, in accordance with the Australian
                Privacy Principles and the GDPR.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>WHEN PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED &amp; DISCLOSED</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In general, the primary principle is that we will not use any
                Personal Information other than for the purpose for which it was
                collected other than with the individual’s permission. The purpose
                of collection is determined by the circumstances in which the
                information was collected and/or submitted.
            </li>
            <li>
                We will only process Personal Information when we can identify a
                lawful basis to do so. It is always our responsibility to ensure
                that we can demonstrate which lawful basis applies to the
                particular processing purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
                The most common lawful bases relied upon are:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>Consent</em>
                        : we will only rely upon express, clear and informed consent.
                        Any consent provided may specify and/or restrict the purpose,
                        and can be withdrawn at any time without penalty. We will keep
                        a record of when and how we got consent from an individual.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Legitimate interests</em>
                        : we will only rely upon an identifiable legitimate interest
                        where we can demonstrate that the processing of Personal
                        Information is necessary to achieve it by balancing it against
                        the individual’s interests, rights and freedoms. We will keep a
                        record of our legitimate interests assessments
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                We will retain Personal Information for the period necessary to
                fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer
                retention period is required or permitted by law.
            </li>

                If it is necessary for us to disclose an individual’s Personal
                Information to third parties in a manner compliant with the
                Australian Privacy Principles in the course of our business, we
                will inform you that we intend to do so, or have done so, as soon
                as practical.
            </li>
            <li>
                We will not disclose or sell an individual’s Personal Information
                to unrelated third parties under any circumstances, unless the

                Information is used to enable us to operate our business,

                    <li>
                        Investigating any complaints about or made by an individual, or
                        if we have reason to suspect that an individual is in breach of
                        any of our terms and conditions or that an individual is or has
                        been otherwise engaged in any unlawful activity; and/or

            <li>
                There are some circumstances in which we must disclose an
                individual’s information:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Where we reasonably believe that an individual may be engaged
                        in fraudulent, deceptive or unlawful activity that a
                        governmental authority should be made aware of;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As required by any law (including the Privacy Act); and/or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In order to sell our business (in that we may need to transfer
                        Personal Information to a new owner).
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                We will not disclose an individual’s Personal Information to any
                entity outside of Australia that is in a jurisdiction that does not
                have a similar regime to the Australian Privacy Principles or an
                implemented and enforceable privacy policy similar to this Privacy
                Policy. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any disclosure
                to an entity outside of Australia will not be made until that
                entity has agreed in writing with us to safeguard Personal
                Information as we do.
            </li>
            <li>
                We may utilise third-pay service providers (such as Gmail from
                Google, Inc., and MailChimp from The Rocket Science Group LLC) to
                communicate with an individual and to store contact details about
                an individual. These service providers are located in the United
                States of America.
            </li>
            <li>
                An individual who uses Milanote from outside of Australia will be
                sending information (including Personal Information) to the United
                States where our servers are located. That information may then be
                transferred within the United States or back out of the United
                States to other countries outside of the individual’s country of
                residence, depending on the type of information and how it is
                stored by us. These countries may not necessarily have data
                protection laws as comprehensive or protective as those in your
                country of residence, however our collection, storage and use of
                Personal Information will at all times continue to be governed by
                this Privacy Policy.

        <h3>OPTING “IN” OR “OUT”</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                An individual may opt to not have us collect their Personal
                Information. This may prevent us from offering them some or all of
                our services and may terminate their access to some or all of the
                services they access with or through us. They will be aware of this
                when:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Opt In.</strong>
                        Where relevant, the individual will have the right to choose to
                        have information collected and/or receive information from us;
                        or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Opt Out.</strong>
                        Where relevant, the individual will have the right to choose to
                        exclude himself or herself from some or all collection of
                        information and/or receiving information from us.

            </li>
            <li>
                If an individual believes that they have received information from

                us on the details below.

        <h3>THE SAFETY &amp; SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                We have appointed a Data Protection Officer to oversee the
                management of this Privacy Policy and compliance with the
                Australian Privacy Principles, the Privacy Act and the GDPR. This
                officer may have other duties within our business and also be
                assisted by internal and external professionals and advisors.
            </li>
            <li>
                We will take all reasonable precautions to protect an individual’s
                Personal Information from unauthorised access. This includes
                appropriately securing our physical facilities and electronic
                networks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Milanote uses SSL encryption to store and transfer Personal
                Information. Despite this, the security of online transactions and
                the security of communications sent by electronic means or by post
                cannot be guaranteed. Each individual that provides information to
                us via the internet, over the phone or by post does so at their own
                risk. We cannot accept responsibility for misuse or loss of, or
                unauthorised access to, Personal Information where the security of
                information is not within our control.
            </li>
            <li>
                We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any
                third party (including third parties that we are permitted to
                disclose an individual’s Personal Information to in accordance with
                this policy or any applicable laws) unless otherwise required by
                the Privacy Act and the GDPR. The collection and use of an
                individual’s information by such third parties may be subject to
                separate privacy and security policies.
            </li>
            <li>
                If an individual suspects any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised
                access to, their Personal Information, they should let us know
                immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
                We are not liable for any loss, damage or claim arising out of
                another person’s use of the Personal Information where we were
                authorised to provide that person with the Personal Information.
            </li>
            <li>
                Where there is a breach of security leading to the accidental or
                unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of,
                or access to, Personal Information, then:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We will immediately establish the likelihood and severity of
                        the resulting risk to wider rights and freedoms of natural
                        persons;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If we determine there is a risk from the security breach, then
                        we will immediately notify the relevant supervisory authority
                        and provide all relevant information on the particular breach,
                        and by no later than 72 hours after having first become aware
                        of the breach;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If we determine there is a high risk from the security breach
                        (a higher threshold than set for notifying supervisory
                        authorities), we will immediately notify the affected
                        individuals and provide all relevant information on the
                        particular breach without undue delay.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                We will document the facts relating to any security breach, its
                effects and the remedial action taken, and investigate the cause of
                the breach and how to prevent similar situations in the future.

        <h3>HOW TO ACCESS AND/OR UPDATE INFORMATION</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Users of Milanote can update their Personal Information from within
                their Milanote account or profile.
            </li>
            <li>
                Subject to the Australian Privacy Principles and the GDPR, an
                individual has the right to request from us the Personal
                Information that we have about them, and we have an obligation to
                provide them with such information as soon as practicable, and by
                no later than 28 days of receiving the written request. The
                individual is free to retain and reuse their Personal Information
                for their own purposes. We may be required to transmit the Personal
                Information directly to another organisation if this is technically
                feasible.
            </li>
            <li>
                If an individual cannot update their own information, we will
                correct any errors in the Personal Information we hold about an
                individual within 28 days of receiving written notice from them
                about those errors, or two months where the request for
                rectification is complex.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is an individual’s responsibility to provide us with accurate
                and truthful Personal Information. We cannot be liable for any
                information that is provided to us that is incorrect.
            </li>
            <li>
                Where a request to access Personal Information is manifestly
                unfounded, excessive and/or repetitive, we may refuse to respond or
                charge an individual a reasonable fee for our costs incurred in
                meeting any of their requests to disclose the Personal Information
                we hold about them. Where we refuse to respond to a request, we
                will explain why to the individual, informing them of their right
                to complain to the supervisory authority and to a judicial remedy
                without undue delay and at the latest within 28 days.
            </li>
            <li>
                We may be required to delete or remove all Personal Information we
                have on an individual upon request in the following circumstances:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Where the Personal Information is no longer necessary in
                        relation to the purpose for which it was originally collected
                        and/or processed;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the individual withdraws consent;

                    <li>
                        When the individual objects to the processing and there is no
                        overriding legitimate interest for continuing the processing;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The processing of the Personal Information was otherwise in

                    <li>
                        The Personal Information has to be erased in order to comply
                        with a legal obligation; and/or
                    </li>

                We may refuse to delete or remove all Personal Information we have
                on an individual where the Personal Information was processed for
                the following reasons:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        To exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
