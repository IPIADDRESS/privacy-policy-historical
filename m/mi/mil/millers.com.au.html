<h2>Specialty Fashion Group Privacy Policy</h2>

The company’s brands include Autograph, City Chic, Crossroads, Katie's, Millers and Rivers.</p>
<p>Some of the information you provide us as part of your dealings with us is “personal information” under the Privacy Act 1998 (Cth) (the Act). This Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, handle, use, transmit and disclose your personal information and applies to you unless you give us explicit consent to act otherwise. If you would like to know more about data protection generally, there is information available from the Australian Information Commissioner at the following website – <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au." target="_blank">www.oaic.gov.au.</a></p>
<p>We generally collect personal information at our stores, corporate premises and online, both electronically and in hard copy.</p>
<p>At SFG we use your personal information primarily for the purposes of: marketing and promotion (by email, text messaging, social networking, conventional post and other means), internal accounting and auditing, recording proof of purchase, validating cheque transactions, receiving, processing and delivering product orders, processing payment, managing our websites (which may include registering you to use our websites), regulatory reporting and compliance, recruitment, servicing our relationship with you and to provide you with information, products and services you may request from time to time. We may communicate additional purposes for use and disclosure of personal information at the point of collection.</p>
<p>SFG may engage or deal with other persons or organisations (for example, loyalty program administrators and partners, data analysis specialists, statement producers, data mail houses, data processing organisations, marketing researchers, specialist call centres and service providers, promotional services providers, data hosting service providers, SFG agents, SFG contractors, SFG suppliers, SFG joint venture partners) (all Third Party Providers) to assist SFG in carrying out the above purposes. Your personal information may be disclosed to such persons or organisations for these purposes and, in providing a service, they may contact you directly. In some circumstances, they may disclose personal information they collected from you to SFG for one or more of the purposes already mentioned.</p>
<p>The nature of the information collected will vary depending on the purpose for which the information was collected. However, the information we usually collect includes name, address, credit and debit card details, phone number, email address, work history, SFG website passwords and usernames, clothing size information etc. This information allows us to provide products and services to you or otherwise interact with you. If you do not provide us with the personal information requested, we may not be able to provide the services or interact with you.</p>

<h2>PERSONALISED SIZE RECOMMENDATION SERVICE</h2>
<p>SFG has integrated a service to provide personalized clothing size recommendations to customers of our online shops. The service (“FIT FINDER”) is embedded on our product detail pages, and you may submit the following data in order to use the service:</p>

<p>The FIT FINDER cookie improves your shopping experience, identifies recurring customers, and allows us to display and provide specific clothing size recommendations directly on our product detail pages.
