We may use this information in the aggregate or combine it with information that we have already collected about you.</p><p><strong>Cookie.</strong> "Cookies" are small bits of information that are stored on your computer by your web browser. Web beacons or “pixel tags” are small strings of code placed on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring information.

If you are a registered user on our site and you elect to have the site store your MileagePlus number, the cookie stored on your computer will contain your MileagePlus number.</p><p>If you do not want your information to be collected through cookies, you can change the preferences in your particular Internet browser. Some website functionality may not work properly if your browser does not accept cookies.

Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We and our service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our sites and services to, among other things, track the activities of visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about usage.

United and our service providers may use cookies and web beacons when working with these companies to provide them information regarding your use of the site (whether individually or in the aggregate) to assist them in determining relevant advertising.</p><p>In addition, some advertising technology used by United to deliver advertisements may use separate cookies and other tracking technologies. This technology may be delivered via visits to our website, email messages, apps or otherwise. Web beacons on some pages of our site, in conjunction with these advertising cookies and our other cookies, enable the advertising technology to better understand onsite activity in the aggregate, to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this website, other websites or apps, and to learn which advertisements bring users to our site or our apps or otherwise take action.</p><p>Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, clear GIFs, Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy</p><p>Third-party ad networks may be members of either the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or About Ads-Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAI”).

Unless and until we are advised otherwise, we consider that such third party has an appropriate legal basis to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions and any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If such third party who has your full name and booking reference contacts us and seeks information on your booking or requests changes to it, we will disclose your booking information and allow such third party to make changes as we will conclude that third party has an appropriate legal basis to do so.

<div><p>We and our third-party service providers, including ad networks, use the information that we collect about you to serve advertisements to you on various channels, including, but not limited to, United and third-party websites, United and third party mobile apps and other mediums that may include social networks and television. We and our third-party service providers may collect the data that we use to determine relevant advertising from the following sources: data collected about you online and through your use of our mobile apps, whether collected directly or automatically through cookies, web beacons and other technologies, including technologies designed to collect data through mobile apps, third party sites (e.g., engagement with social media when publicly available), and offline, including, but not limited to, data combined or appended from various sources. These advertisements may be about United products and services or products and services of third parties that we think might be of interest to you. United and our third party service providers may use cookies and web beacons when working with these companies to provide them information regarding your use of the site (whether individually or in the aggregate) to assist them in determining relevant advertising.</p><p>In addition, some third party advertising technology used by United to deliver advertisements may use separate cookies and other tracking technologies. This technology may be delivered via visits to our website, email messages, apps or otherwise. Web beacons on some pages of our site, in conjunction with these advertising cookies and our other cookies, enable the third-party advertising technology to better understand onsite activity in the aggregate, to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this website, other websites or apps, and to learn which advertisements bring users to our site or our apps or otherwise take action.</p><p>Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy.</p><p>Third party ad networks may be members of either the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or About Ads-Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAI”). If they are members and you do not want to receive targeted advertisements from these third-party ad networks, you may opt out.  Information as to member companies, the practices of such third-party ad networks and your choices regarding having information used by these companies, including how to opt out, can be found at either: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" class="external-link" aria-describedby="extdisclaimer" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> for NAI members or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" class="external-link" aria-describedby="extdisclaimer" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> for DAI members.  Information on how to opt out of the use of your information by DoubleClick is available at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" class="external-link" aria-describedby="extdisclaimer" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</a> and information on how to opt out of Google Analytics is available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" class="external-link" aria-describedby="extdisclaimer" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p><p>Opting out of one or more NAI or DAI members means that only those particular members will no longer deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other non-United websites. If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit one of the above referenced opt-out pages and then you erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAI opt-out may no longer be active.</p></div>

<div><p>United maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information. When you place orders online to purchase services or access your MileagePlus account information, we use secure servers to protect your personal information, which is intended to encrypt the personal information that is transmitted between you and our sites.  Although United takes reasonable steps to safeguard and to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, it cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access and United makes no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.</p><p>If a third party, including but not limited to a family member, friend, co-worker or corporate travel desk, seeks to transact business with United on your behalf, that party will be asked to provide us with the same personal information we would collect directly from you to complete your transaction. Unless and until we are advised otherwise, we consider that such third party has your consent and authorization to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions, including any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If such third party who has your full name and booking reference contacts us and seeks information on your booking or requests changes to it, we will disclose your booking information and allow such third party to make changes as we will conclude you have given them your consent to do so. Please note that the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by a third party is subject to your dealings with them and, if applicable, any of their privacy policies and practices. If you do not want an individual to obtain information on or make changes to your booking, you should not share your booking reference with them.</p></div>

<p>To protect your privacy and United's proprietary databases and systems, you should not share any of your information, such as MileagePlus number or password, with any unauthorized individuals or third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to your sensitive account information. For more information, see our <a href="https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/help/PIN-password.aspx">PIN/Password Frequently Asked Questions</a> page. You should also take all necessary steps to secure your mobile devices and protect information you may have stored on them. We do not have control over the security of your mobile device. United assumes no responsibility for the loss of information associated with security disrupting technologies, including but not limited to reverse engineering of mobile device applications or malware, that compromise the United mobile application(s) as a result of owner or third-party initiated changes to the mobile device.
