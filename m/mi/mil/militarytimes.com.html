					  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong>&nbsp; January 8, 2006</p>
					  <p>
					  The following Privacy Policy governs the  online information collection practices of MilitaryTimes.com (“we” or “us”).&nbsp; Specifically,  it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are  using the MilitaryTimes.com website (the “Site”), and the ways in which we use  this information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy,  including our children’s privacy statement, does not apply to any information  you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means  (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).&nbsp; 
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  Please read this Privacy Policy  carefully.&nbsp; By visiting and using the Site,  you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed  by this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a>.&nbsp; Because  the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some  point in the future, in which case we’ll post the changes to this Privacy Policy  on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date  of the changes.&nbsp; By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy  Policy as modified.

					  <p><strong>How We Collect  and Use Information</strong></p>
					  <p>
					  We may collect and store personal or other information  that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a  feature provided on the Site).&nbsp; 
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  We also  collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate  online through the Site.&nbsp; For example, we may collect information about your computer’s connection  to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery  of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site.&nbsp; We also may use a standard feature found in  browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your experience with the Site.&nbsp; Cookies are small files that your web browser  places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.&nbsp; By showing how and when visitors use the Site,  cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit  us, and track user trends and patterns.&nbsp;  They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain  areas of the Site where you may have entered  preference information before.&nbsp; The Site  also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as “transparent  GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open  HTML-formatted email messages.
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  We use the information we collect from you while you are using  the Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize  features and advertising that appear on the Site.&nbsp; We also may provide your information to third  parties, such as service providers, contractors, and advertisers, for a variety  of purposes.&nbsp; Unless  you inform us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve the  right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information  collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way and for  any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide you with  information about products and services.&nbsp;  If you do not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you  must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at  the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of  information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to  third-parties.&nbsp; 
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  Please keep in mind  that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for  viewing by third parties online – for example on message boards, web logs,  through email, or in chat areas – that information can be seen, collected and  used by others besides us.&nbsp; We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized  third-party use of such information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  Some  of our third-party advertisers and  ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also may collect  information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies.&nbsp; These third-party advertisers and ad servers  may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to  help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness, or for other purposes.&nbsp; The use and collection of your information by  these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party’s  privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Indeed, the privacy policies of these  third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. &nbsp;&nbsp;If  you have any concerns about a third party’s use of cookies or web beacons or  use of your information, you should visit that party’s website and review its  privacy policy.&nbsp; 
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to  products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do  not control.&nbsp; When you access another  website or purchase third-party products or services through the Site, use of  any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator  of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  We also make some  content, products and services available through our Site through cooperative  relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of our provider  partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, products and/or  services.&nbsp; We may share with our provider  partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of  visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider  partner.&nbsp; In some cases, the provider  partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy  policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner’s use of your  information.&nbsp; The privacy policy of our  provider partners may differ from ours.&nbsp;  If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our  provider partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more  information.&nbsp;
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  We are an affiliate of the CareerBuilder  online careers service.&nbsp; Through our  cooperative relationship with CareerBuilder, we are able to provide you with  access to the CareerBuilder products and services through a co-branded  CareerBuilder site.&nbsp; When you provide  information through the co-branded CareerBuilder site, CareerBuilder may share  your information with us and we may use the information consistent with this Privacy  Policy.
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  Likewise, we are an affiliate of the  Topix.net online news service, which enables us to provide you with access to Topix.net  products and services through a co-branded Topix.net site.&nbsp; When you provide information through the  co-branded Topix.net site, Topix.net may share your information with us and we  may use that information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when  release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a> agreement,  or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets.&nbsp; In the unlikely event that we sell some or  all of our assets, or one or more of our websites is acquired by another  company, information about our users may be among the transferred assets.
