<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>

<p>Totaljobs Group Ltd., ​Blue Fin, 110 Southwark Street, London SE1 0TA operates the websites available at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160828195313/http:/www.milkround.com/" target="_blank">milkround.com</a> where we collect, use and disclose personal information in line with this Policy. Previously the Milkround Online Network was operated by Milkround Online Limited, which was merged to Totaljobs Group Ltd., so that Totaljobs automatically became data controller.</p>

<p>We are part of the StepStone GmbH group of companies (the "StepStone Group"). StepStone is a global online job board company and operates online job portals to accurately match candidates with companies.</p>

<p><strong>What this policy is for</strong></p>

<p>This Policy explains how we collect, use and disclose information about you. By using your information, we can provide the product or service you’ve asked for. The use of your information helps us understand what your needs and interests are, provide personalised content and match the most relevant adverts and services for you.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time by changing it on the Site. We recommend that you re-visit this privacy policy every so often to check if any changes have been made.</p>

<p><strong>Your consent</strong></p>

<p>By completing our registration forms (for example through our websites or mobile applications ("apps"), or by the continued use of our services), you consent to the use of your personal information in accordance with this Policy. This includes any sensitive personal information that you may provide, such as details of any medical conditions that you may publish as part of a CV, mention in a forum post or in an email to us.</p>

<h3><strong>Collection of information</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Registration, forums, apps and your dealings with us</strong></p>

<p>We collect information about you when you provide it to us. For example, when you create an account or a profile, upload a CV, fill out our online forms, respond to one of our promotions, enquire about our products and services, by telephone or in person, or on paper. If you telephone us or if we call you, the call may be recorded for quality, training and management purposes. We may also record customer enquiries via online chat for the same purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Information from devices</strong></p>

<p>We also collect information indirectly from you, from the device you may be using when you interact with one of our websites or use our apps. This can include your geographic location, which for example may be required to provide services to you that have copyright restrictions. We may also collect information from cookies placed on your computer or your device. See our Cookie Policy for more information about our use of cookies.</p>

<p><strong>Social login</strong></p>

<p>The content on our websites and in our communications with you may be adjusted depending on what we know about the content, products and services that you may like. This means we can highlight content and articles that we believe will be of interest to you. We provide personalisation by using cookies, IP addresses, web beacons, URL tracking and app settings. See our Cookie Policy for more information about how we use these.</p>

<p><strong>Market research and analytics</strong></p>

We may use information obtained through your participation in competitions, offers and events provided both by us and in cooperation with our commercial partners to deliver more relevant online adverts.

<p>If you apply for credit, then, in order to help us to make credit decisions about you, prevent fraud, check your identity and prevent money laundering, we may search the files of credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches on your file.

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>This Policy covers our use of cookies, IP addresses, and other technologies for the Milkround Online Network.</p>

<h3><strong>What are Cookies?</strong></h3>

<p>Cookies and other online tracking technologies are small bits of data or code that are used to identify your devices when you use and interact with our websites and other services. They are often used for remembering your preferences, to identify popular news stories, and remember you’re logged in, allowing you to comment on stories.</p>

<h3><strong>What Cookies do we use and how do we use them?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Essential cookies and similar technologies</strong></p>

<p>These are vital for the running of our services on our websites and apps. Without the use of these cookies parts of our websites would not function. E.g. we use these cookies to tell if you’re logged in to your account, which allows extra functionality, such as making comments on stories.</p>

<p><strong>Analytics cookies and similar technologies</strong></p>

<p>These collect information about your use of our websites and apps, and enable us to improve the way it works. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our websites allowing us to provide better services. They help us record how you interact with our websites, such as how you navigate around pages and from page to page; identifying improvements we can make to the customer journey. They also help identify any difficulties you have accessing our services, so we can fix any problems. Additionally these cookies allow us to see overall patterns of usage at an aggregated level.</p>

<p><strong>Functional/preference cookies and similar technologies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember things like language, your username (so you can log in faster), text size, and location, so we can show you relevant content to where you are. They allow us to customize the services you have accessed. We also use these cookies to provide you with services such as video clips.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking, advertising cookies and similar technologies</strong></p>

<p>We use these types of technologies to provide advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. This can be done by delivering online adverts based your previous web browsing activity, known as “online behavioural advertising” (OBA). Cookies are placed on your browser which will remember the websites you have visited. Advertising based on what you have been looking at is then displayed to you when you visit websites who use the same advertising networks.</p>

<p>For example: You may be doing online research in order to buy a bicycle, and read a number of articles about bikes on various websites. As you browse those sites a cookie from an advertising network would be placed in your browser. It would remember that you had visited several websites related to cycling. Then, when you visited another website in the same advertising network, the website could show you an advert related to cycling.</p>

<p>We may also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you with adverts based on your location, offers you click on, and other similar interactions with our websites and apps.</p>

<p>To help us deliver relevant advertising using cookies, we use Google Double Click. You can find out more about Google Double Click here.</p>

<p><strong>Web beacons</strong></p>

<p>These are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or webpage and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been activated. Web beacons used on web pages or in emails allow us to see how successful an article has been or that an email message was successfully delivered and read in a marketing campaign. Web beacons are also used to verify any clicks through to links or advertisements contained in emails. We may use this information to help us identify which emails are more interesting to you and to inform advertisers how many customers have clicked on their adverts (this information is aggregated and does not identify you individually).</p>

<p><strong>Flash cookies </strong></p>

<p>We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as Flash cookies) are used to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking URLs</strong></p>

<p>Tracking URLs are a special web link that allows us to measure when a link is clicked on. They are used to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns and advertising and the popularity of articles that are read.</p>

<p><strong>We also use cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>

<p>When you access and interact with our services cookies may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to our websites, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, other software or hardware information, and your geographic location.</p>

<p><strong>If you access our services from a mobile device </strong></p>

<p>We may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geo-location data, and other transactional information for that device. We may also use the unique identifier to validate free trials, for example.</p>

<p><strong>Usage of services</strong></p>

<p>To collect, use and store information about your usage of our services, websites and apps, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen or interacted with.</p>

<p><strong>To provide relevant content</strong></p>

<p>The content on our websites and in our communications with you may be adjusted depending on what we know about the content, products and services that you like. This means we can highlight content and articles that we believe will be of interest to you. We provide personalisation by using cookies, IP addresses, web beacons, URL tracking and mobile app settings.</p>

<h3><strong>Third party advertisers</strong></h3>

<p>We sell space on our websites to advertisers. The adverts they display on our websites will often contain cookies. Our advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you with advertisements that they believe are relevant. They may use browsing data obtained to restrict the number of times you see particular adverts (frequency capping). You may also see adverts from these advertisers on other websites you visit.</p>

<p>Third parties that support our services by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate service usage, may also use cookies and other technologies to collect information relevant to the provision of those services.</p>

<p>We do not control third-party cookies or other technologies. Their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. You should make sure you are aware of how third parties will use cookies by checking the third party’s cookie policy.</p>

<p>To learn more about controlling cookies and similar technologies, please see the section below on managing cookies.</p>

<h3><strong>Mobile applications</strong></h3>

<p>By downloading our apps, we will require access to the following services on your device: unique identifier (UDID), MAC address or other applicable device identifier and location. Other services may also be required in order for the apps to function. We may use this information to validate free trials. Our apps may also provide push notifications to your device. You may control these through using the tools on your device, such as turning off push notification and location services.</p>
