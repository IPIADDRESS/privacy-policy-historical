		For each visitor to our Website, our 
		Web server automatically recognises Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, 
		browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, 
		platform type, date/time stamp, and number and location on a page of 
		clicks. The information is collected in log files and this is normal 
		practice for standard websites.<br>
		This information is not linked to personally identifiable information.<br>
		The information we collect in this manner is used for internal review to help improve 
		the website experience and the information is then electronically 
		discarded.<br>
		<br>
		We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via 
		e-mail. We do not sell, rent or trade that information to any third 
		party.<br>
		<br>
		For any personal information supplied to us electronically or other by 
		other means, you will only receive communication in connection with and 
		relevant to that original correspondence.<br>
		<br>
		If you make a hotel booking through this website you will be asked for 
		the following information: Name, home or work telephone number, fax 
		number, email address, credit card number and its expiration date, and 
		your credit card billing address.<br>
		If you make a reservation for other people you will be asked for 
		identifiable information for these other parties. You should obtain 
		permission from these individuals to provide their information. <br>
		The information is necessary in order to process your reservation and 
		confirm back to you that this has been successfully completed. The 
		information is then used to identify you should you wish to query and/or 
		change details of your reservation. <br>
		<br>
		Cookies (text files placed on your hard drive): These are used to record 
		session information only at the point you choose to click through a 
		booking/quote request page. The information stored is used to speed up 
		the user experience by means such as auto filling requested dates and 
		logins.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server 
		companies. <br>
		<br>
		Upon request we provide site visitors with access to communications that 
		the consumer/visitor has directed to our site (e.g., e-mails, customer 
		inquiries).<br>
		<br>
		Upon request we offer visitors the ability to have inaccuracies 
		corrected in contact information.<br>
		<br>
		Security: When sensitive information is requested such as credit card 
		numbers SSL secure encrypted transmission is used. This is signified by 
		the prefix https in your browser address bar and a padlock/security logo 
		in your browser window.</div><br>
