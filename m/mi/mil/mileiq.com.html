			<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
			
			<p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of MileIQ.</p>
			
			<p><b>Promotional Communications</b></p>
			<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Mobile Data Labs by following the instructions in those communications or by changing your notification settings in the application’s settings menu.

If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mileiq.com">support@mileiq.com</a>. However, please note that under the law, services such as MileIQ that permit California residents to opt into or opt out of this type of sharing are not required to provide such information upon receiving a request, but rather may respond by notifying the user of his or her right to prevent the disclosure.
