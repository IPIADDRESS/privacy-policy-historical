<h3>Where We Store Your Personal Data</h3>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred    to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area    ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the    EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. If your personal data is    transferred to, stored at or otherwise processed in a country or territory    outside the EEA, and that country or territory has not been recognised as    providing an adequate level of data protection, we will put in place    additional safeguards to protect your personal data, based on standard    contractual clauses.&nbsp; You can ask us to    provide a copy of these clauses by using the contact details below.</p>
<h3>Third Parties and Data Transfer Across Borders</h3>
<p>You can be assured that we will protect your    privacy. We will not make your personal information available to anyone    without your agreement unless it is for research purposes only or if required    by law. This includes your name and e-mail address.</p>
<p>We may share your personal data with third parties.    Where these transfers are across borders or outside the EEA we shall put    safeguards in place to ensure the transfer is made by a legitimate method for    the purposes of EU data protection law and secure. </p>
<p>Your personal information may be collected, stored,    transferred or processed by our sister companies within the WPP group, or 3rd    party service providers for research-related purposes, such as data    processing, and fulfilment of prize draws or other incentives both within and    outside the EEA. They are all contractually bound to keep any information    they collect and disclose to us or, we collect and disclose to them,    confidential and must protect it with security standards and practices that    are equivalent to our own</p>
<h3>Keeping Your Personal Data Secure</h3>
<p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your    data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. All    information you provide to us is stored on a secure server. We limit access    to the information by our own employees, contractors, site service providers    and those individuals who are authorised for the proper handling of such    information. We request that our third party contractors and site service    providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via    the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take reasonable steps    to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data    transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have    received your information, we will use strict procedures and security    features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<h3>Uses Made of the Information</h3>
<p>We have listed below the ways in which we use your    personal data.&nbsp; We are also required by    law to explain the legal basis for using your personal data, and this is also    set out below.&nbsp; The legal basis in each    case is that we have your consent for the use of your personal data, or that    we need to use your personal data in order to perform a contract with you, or    that the use of your personal data is necessary for our (or third parties’)    legitimate interests (in which case we will explain what those interests    are).&nbsp; Where we use your personal data    with your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time</p>
<ul>
    <li>To    ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner    for you and for your computer (this is based on our legitimate interest in    ensuring that our site is presented to you in the most effective way    possible).</li>
    <li>To    provide you with information, products or services that you request from us    or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted    for such purposes (this is based on your consent, which you may withdraw at    any time).</li>
    <li>To    carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you    and us (this is based on contractual necessity – we need to use your personal    data to perform our contract with you).</li>
    <li>To    allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you    choose to do so.</li>
    <li>To    notify you about changes to our service (this is based on our legitimate    interest in keeping you informed about changes to our service).</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use your personal data, or permit    selected companies within the Kantar Group to use your personal data, to    provide you with information about goods and services which may be of    interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by post or    telephone.&nbsp; This is based on our    legitimate interest, or our group members’ legitimate interest, in providing    you with information about our or their goods or services.</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
<p>We may disclose your personal data to any member of    the Kantar group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company    and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act    2006. We may disclose your personal data to third parties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In    the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may    disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such    business or assets.</li>
    <li>If    Kantar or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in    which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the    transferred assets.</li>
    <li>If    we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to    comply with any legal obligation; or to protect the rights, property, or    safety of Kantar, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging    information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud    protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Long We Keep Your Personal Data</h3>
<p>We are required by law to keep your personal data    only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which we are using    it.&nbsp; The period for which we keep your    personal data will be determined by a number of criteria, including the    purposes for which we are using the information, the amount and sensitivity    of the information, the potential risk from any unauthorised use or    disclosure of the information, and our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
<h3>Your Rights</h3>
<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your    personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting    your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to    disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can    exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on    the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any    time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@millwardbrown.com">webmaster@millwardbrown.com</a></p>
<p>You also have the following rights in relation to    your personal data (some of these rights apply only in certain circumstances,    and some of them vary according to the legal basis on which we are processing    your data – please see above for further details):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The         right to ask whether we’re processing your personal data and, if we are,         to find out details of that processing (as well as obtaining a copy of         your personal data).</li>
    <li>The         right to ask us to correct any personal data that we hold about you         that’s inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
    <li>The         right to ask us to delete personal data that we hold about you.</li>
    <li>The right         to object to how we’re processing your personal data, and to ask us to         restrict how we’re processing your personal data.</li>
    <li>The         right to have the personal data that you’ve provided to us provided to         you in a structured and commonly-used electronic format.&nbsp; You can also ask us to transfer your         personal data directly to another company if that’s feasible.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not happy with how we’ve dealt with your    personal data, we’d like a chance to put it right – please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@millwardbrown.com">webmaster@millwardbrown.com</a> . However, you have    the right to complain to a supervisory authority – the authority for the UK    is the Information Commissioner (<a href="http://www.ico.org.uk/">www.ico.org.uk</a>).</p>
<h3>Children Data Collection</h3>
<p>We never knowingly invite children under the age of    16 years to participate in research studies without consent. If it is    necessary and appropriate to a particular project to directly involve    children under the age of 16 years, we take measures to ensure we have been    given permission by the responsible adult.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Automated Decision Making / Profiling</h3>
<p>In certain circumstances we shall carry out    automated decision making or profiling about you.&nbsp; However, in the majority of cases this will    not result in any legally significant decisions being made about you.&nbsp; You have the right to appeal if any    automated decision made about you is legally significant.&nbsp; If you have any questions about this please    contact us.</p>
