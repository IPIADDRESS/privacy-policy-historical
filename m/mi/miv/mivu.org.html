<p>This page describes the ways in which <em><strong>Michigan Virtual University</strong></em>®, a Michigan nonprofit corporation, and all of its divisions (collectively referred to here as "<em>Michigan Virtual University</em>," “<em>MVU</em> ®,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) handle information it obtains about individuals through the websites it operates, including:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mivu.org/" target="_blank"><font color="#008080">www.mivu.org</font></a> (and all sub-domains of mivu.org)<br>

careerforward.org (and all sub-domains of careerforward.org)</p>

<p>We provide a variety of information, features, and functions (the “Services”) through these websites.</p>

<p>This page does not necessarily reflect the ways in which we collect and use information by means other than these Web sites.&nbsp; If you have questions about the ways in which we collect information by other means, please contact us using the contact information in this statement.&nbsp; The practices relating to persons with separate agreements with <em>MVU</em> or its affiliates are separately covered in those agreements.</p>

<p><strong>Information <em>MVU</em> collects</strong></p>

<p>The information we collect will depend upon what you do when visiting our site.&nbsp; EXCEPT AS STATED IN THIS STATEMENT, WE WILL NOT COLLECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU VISIT OUR SITES UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE SUCH INFORMATION TO US. You are free to visit our sites without providing personally identifiable information. However, if you would like to access our Services, in some cases you must first register or create an account or learning profile with <em>MVU</em>. When you register or create an account or learning profile, we will request certain personal information. Requests can include, but are not limited to, your name, address, city, state, zip code, county, email address, age, home or other contact information, school contact information, gender, and parent/guardian contact information. In some cases, the sponsoring party funding your participation in the course (a "Sponsoring Party") may provide this or other information about you to us. We may use this information to create an account or learning profile and issue you an access ID and password. If you are paying with a credit card, we also will collect your credit card number (employing industry standard security and encryption technologies), billing information and email address to process your payment.</p>

<p>Personal information better enables us to provide you with content relevant to your interests and provides us with aggregate demographic data that <em>MVU</em> uses to improve the services offered to users. Users may change their personal information at any time by using the provided interface once they are logged in and as often as necessary. If users are unable to log in and change their information themselves, they will be able to send an email to mivuhelp at mivu dot org or contact us at the telephone number or address below for assistance.</p>

<p>In addition to registration, <em>MVU</em> may, from time to time, request personal information for purposes such as the provision of customer service, billing, network management, customer surveys, newsletter subscriptions, offers of related services, and other exchanges of information. Users may opt out of receiving future promotional mailings at any time. Please see below for User Options - Opt Out.</p>

<p><em>MVU</em> gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users’ access most often. <em>MVU</em> automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users' access to our sites. We analyze these logs for sales and marketing purposes as well as system performance monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the overall, aggregate trends they reveal about out customers, not for the behaviors of individual users.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy of Children</strong></p>

<p>The <em>MVU</em> policy is to limit the collection of personal information from children in substantial agreement with the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”). Children ages 12 and under will not knowingly be allowed to register with <em>MVU</em> or create an account without their parent's permission. Before children ages 12 and under may participate in any Services requiring registration (e.g., creating or enrolling in a course, chat rooms, message boards or other forums), the child's school must first obtain the parent's permission and that permission may allow us to collect and maintain the child’s information. If, at any time after a parent gives permission, the parent desires to review the child's personal information, request that it be deleted, or refuse to allow any further collection of the child's information, the parent may contact the school's representative for <em>MVU</em> or <em>MVU</em> with such a request. If you have additional questions regarding your child's use of his or her account, you may contact the school's representative or <em>MVU</em>. Please see below for our contact information.</p>

<p><em>MVU</em> abides by COPPA and the regulations under it.&nbsp;You can obtain more information about COPPA from the Federal Trade Commission by clicking <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What <em>MVU</em> does with the information it collects</strong></p>

<p>The User ID you select during registration must be used to log in and participate in a Service or course. Once you log in to our Blackboard® site, you may be identified to the instructor and other students in that course by your full name in areas such as discussion forums, email lists, web conferences, and other places where participant names appear. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes available to the instructor and other students in that course. Blackboard has a user assessable directory feature.&nbsp;Anyone with a Blackboard account can choose to share their Blackboard profile information in this directory.&nbsp;You can turn on or off this feature once logged into Blackboard. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>

<p><em>MVU</em> hosts, or provides links to, chat rooms, forums and message boards. Our online instructors, instructor services, and student services staff monitor and respond to user email sent to them and monitor and participate with users in threaded discussions and other online forums. <em>MVU</em> may monitor or edit the contents of a user's email or threaded discussions or other online forums as required for normal maintenance of any of our Web sites or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on <em>MVU</em>; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of <em>MVU</em>; or (3) act to protect the personal safety of our guests or the public.</p>

<p>If you are a<em><strong>Michigan Virtual School™</strong></em> &nbsp;student, your grades in <em><strong>MVS</strong></em>™ courses will be reported to your mentor and your school and/or sponsoring institution. Except as described further in this statement,<em>the personal information you supply to</em> MVU <em>will not be given, sold, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed to any third parties outside of</em> MVU<em>, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal process, (ii) enforce the Terms of Use, (iii) respond to claims that any content on our sites violates the rights of third parties, or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of</em> MVU<em>, its users, or the public.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Mydreamexplorer®</em></strong>&nbsp;is designed to protect your personal information from being seen or accessed by others.<em>Each school district has designated administrators who have access to information for students in their buildings and student counselors/advisors will be able to review the EDP information. Other than these school officials, your EDP information will never be sold or revealed to other people or companies.</em></p>

<p><em>MVU</em> may use aggregated personal information to determine the demographics of our users and to distribute statistics and general marketplace information about <em>MVU</em>. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that these demographics do not identify any specific user.</p>

<p><em>On occasion, the MVS may engage <strong>educational researchers</strong> to conduct a study on the school's behalf to improve instruction and services for students.&nbsp;Any individual student information collected or analyzed&nbsp;in a research&nbsp;study will&nbsp;be protected to the maximum extent required by law and no individual names will be used in any reports or publications.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="body_copy"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span class="body_copy"><em>MVU</em> will abide by the <strong>student privacy guidelines</strong>&nbsp;set forth by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

<p>Certain non-personal information regarding users is recorded by the standard operation of the Internet servers hosting our sites. This information may be used to provide visitors to our sites with an enhanced, online experience. <em>MVU</em> may disclose aggregated user statistics, in order to describe the service to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties and for other lawful purposes.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript and Web Browser Support</strong></p>

<p><em>MVU</em> &nbsp;websites are designed to provide you with the information and services you expect; web pages that are accessible, easy-to-use, error-free, and provide appropriate security. To achieve this goal, we've developed our site in accordance with widely-accepted web standards.</p>

<p>If our pages do not function correctly or appear broken, you may have JavaScript turned off, or you may be using a web browser that is not compatible with the security or development standards of this site. Most <em>MVU</em> websites and web applications use JavaScript and require that you allow JavaScript in your web browser in order for them to function correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>

<p>We or our hosting provider may collect traffic information from visitors for statistical analysis and site improvement. When you accesses a site, we or our hosting provider may collect information about your visit in a log file on a server. Log file information may include, but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.&nbsp; We or our hosting provider use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements in the aggregate, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses and other log file information are not linked to personally identifiable information. We do not try to track users or to identify users individually, but we or our hosting provider do review this information to understand overall trends and to determine what kinds of content are popular and useful to users.</p>

<p><strong>Outsourcing Providers</strong></p>

<p>We may use outside shipping or other outsourcing providers to process and ship orders or perform other functions.&nbsp; We require that these outsourcing providers not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes, except for backup and recovery operations. Although we use good faith efforts to ensure compliance by its outsourcing providers, we cannot, and will not, be responsible to users for misuse of personally identifiable information by such outsourcing providers.</p>

<p><strong>Specific Services</strong></p>

<p>We may have agreements with other parties to provide specific services. When you use such services, we may share personally identifiable information with such parties. In such cases, we will use good faith efforts to restrict the information provided to that which is necessary for the provision of such services.</p>

<p><strong>Supplementation of Information</strong></p>

<p>We sometimes supplement the information we receive from you with other information we receive from third party sources, such as credit card issuers or clearinghouses.</p>

<p>A user may opt to cease receiving future promotional mailings by sending an email to: unsubscribe at mivu dot org and including his or her full name, User ID (if applicable), email address, and the name of the mailing he or she no longer wishes to receive in the subject or message area. A user may also contact us at the telephone number or address below.&nbsp;<em>MVU</em> reserves the right to send all users non-promotional email related to business practices and systems operations, such as outage notifications and security warnings, even if the user has opted out of promotional mailings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Response Times</strong></p>

<p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make timely changes you may request regarding your personal information. Many such changes are accomplished using batch processing (i.e., collecting a number of similar change requests and making all such changes at once), so the changes may not be immediately effective. If you require an immediate change to your personally identifiable information and are unable to make such a change using the available site resources, please contact us using the information below.</p>
