We spend months preparing the nest for their arrival and then the minute we see that little face, we vow to provide everything he or she needs to grow up healthy, strong and happy.  If only it were that easy! 

Unfortunately, there are a lot of potentially dangerous chemicals  sneak their way into our lives without our notice through common every day products. Did you know that many brands of diapers, baby bottles,  shampoo, nursery paint, and toys all contain chemicals that are considered by some researchers to be toxic for kids and the environment?

The good news is that these days there are a TON of great alternatives to help your family live a healthier life.  And yes, even small changes can make a big difference. To help you, we’ve focused our kid products and information on areas that can have the greatest impact – even by starting small. Our goal is to help you spend less time safeguarding the nest and more time enjoying the family within it!">For your Kids</a>                            </li>

Unfortunately, the U.S. EPA tells us that the air inside our homes is likely to be 2 to 5 times more polluted than the outside air.  And, since we spend 90% of our time indoors, we think we can help you do better. 

Of course we don’t just breathe inside our homes: we also sleep, eat, and play.  At MightyNest we have worked to find ways to provide the healthiest, non-toxic options from the mattress in the bedroom to the waterbottle you take to the soccer field.

We are more likely to put off doing the “right thing” if we know it just effects our own health.  We also know how nice it is to get a water bottle and know it is truly safe and durable, and to fill it with clean water. For most of us we want to save our worrying for the things that really matter, but figuring out which things really matter can be confusing.

At MightyNest we grapple with the same information overload as the rest of the country.  We are excited to be able to provide a few of those items that help reduce the worry. We have fun finds like water bottles that don’t leach anything scary and are easy to clean.  We have unearthed hair and body products, sunscreens, and cosmetics that are effective and don’t use dangerous toxins (unfortunately, many other products do).  We have mattresses and bedding that provide the softest and safest materials against your skin and are gorgeous to look at.
