<h6>Last updated: May 24, 2018</h6>

<div class="section-group">
<h3 class="secondary-heading uppercase">Welcome to Mighty Networks!</h3>
<p>
Mighty Networks is a Service of Mighty Software. Inc. All visitors to our Service (“Visitors”) who register with the Service and join a Mighty Network are Members or Hosts. Hosts are the organizers of Mighty Networks. Members register and participate in Mighty Networks. Hosts decide who can join their Mighty Network and whether they choose to run advertising or paid Member subscriptions on their Mighty Network. This Privacy Policy describes how we, Mighty Software, Inc., obtain and use information about you and your visits to our website at mightynetworks.com and your participation in a Mighty Network and your use of Might Networks mobile applications. To offer the personalized experience of a Mighty Network, we collect personal information about you (“Personal Data”). This policy describes how we collect, use, and share your Personal Data with your Host and other Members in connection with your use of the Service, including our mobile applications. Unless defined here, capitalized words have the same meaning as in the Mighty Networks&nbsp;<a href="https://mightynetworks.com/terms_of_use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>, which this Privacy Policy is part of.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section-group">
<h3 class="secondary-heading uppercase">I. Information we collect and how we use it</h3>
<p>
When you visit our website, join or create a Network, interact with us or your Host through the Service, or use our mobile applications, we, as the service provider for your Host, collect Personal Data and other information from you (collectively, “Data”). We use your Personal Data to be able to provide the Service to you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We collect Personal Data when you share it voluntarily.</li>
<li>We collect some Personal Data automatically when you visit our website, use the Service or use our Mighty Networks mobile applications.</li>
<li>We and your Hosts use your Personal Data to provide and improve the Service, understand how you and other Members are using Mighty Networks and to inform you about products and services that may be of interest to you.</li>
<li>Data does not include Your Content or User Generated Content. As we explain in our Terms of Use, you (and the people you license Your Content from) keep complete ownership of all Your Content. By posting Your Content on the Service, you grant us a license to use it, but you and your licensors still own it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secondary-heading uppercase">A. Personal Data you provide directly</h3>
<p>
<strong>‘Personal Data or Personal Information’</strong>
means any information relating to you from which you can be identified, directly or indirectly, including your name, identification number, location, online identifier such as your IP address or device ID, or one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>‘Special Categories of Personal Data’</strong>
means data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>‘Aggregated Data’</strong>
is data in a summary form for statistical analysis. A common purpose of aggregation is to get more information about particular groups based on specific variables such as age, profession, or income level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>‘Pseudonymisation’</strong>
means the processing of your personal data in a way that the personal data can no longer identify you without the use of additional information, so long as the additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to prevent you from being identified or identifiable.
</p>
<p>
We store and use your Personal Data together with an ID we assign each time you join a new Mighty Network. We assign you one ID per Mighty Network to ensure you have a personalized experience in each one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Name and Email Address.</strong>
When you register as a Host or Member of a Mighty Network, we ask you for your real name and your email address. Both we and the Host of the Mighty Network receive access to this information and use it to communicate with you about the Service. In addition, we and your Host may use this address to email you about products or services believed to be of interest to you.
</p>
<p>
If you a paying Host or Member, we may also collect your mailing address and zip code for billing purposes.  Hosts may decide to collect your mailing address, via our Services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Media Profiles.</strong>
You can also register with your Facebook or LinkedIn account. When you register this way, you give us permission to access your Facebook or LinkedIn profile and photo. Your profile and photo will become part of your Mighty Network profile. See below for more information on Integrated Services like Facebook and LinkedIn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Profiles and Topics.</strong>
When you join a Mighty Network, you will be prompted to add a profile, including a short bio, and to choose topics to follow (“Topics”). From this information, Mighty Networks personalizes your experience in each Mighty Network. Your Host can also choose and customize categories of Personal Data to collect from you including, if you agree, Special Categories of Personal Data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Location.</strong>
We ask you for your location so that we can facilitate interactions with other Members in your geographic area. In addition, if you opt-in our mobile app collects your GPS location information. If you enable location features, or do not disable GPS on your mobile device, other Members may be able to see your location.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Personal Data You Provide Directly.</strong>
You may also provide us Personal Data when you use certain features of the Service such as participating in conversations or polls in your Networks, contact us with inquiries, or respond to one of our surveys.
</p>
<h3 class="secondary-heading uppercase">B. Personal Data and Information we collect automatically</h3>
<p>You have the option of registering using an Integrated Service, such as Facebook. If you choose to do this, your profile picture and other Personal Data in your profile on the Integrated Service will become part of your profile on Mighty Networks. Please see the section below on Integrated Services for more detail.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information About Your Use of the Service.</strong>
Our servers automatically record your visits to the Service. Like all other website and mobile app servers, ours compiles a log that records the date, time, browser (i.e., Firefox), device type (i.e., iPhone), operating system (i.e. Android), and originating IP address of each page you visit.
</p>
<p>
We use cookies to collect information about your visits to our website and Service. Cookies are text files placed on your computer by websites to collect standard log information and visitor behavior information. Our cookies collect the following information about you: which website or ad you visited right before ours, which pages you visited on our Service, and how much time you spent on each section of our Service. We may also collect other data about your visit, such as search requests and results. We use this information for our legitimate interests to track usage of our Service, to measure the number of unique visitors to the different sections of our Service, to understand how Members find and join Mighty Networks, and to help us make our Service more valuable to every Host and Member. The use of this information is called “analytics.” Often information used for analytics is aggregated.
</p>
<p>
Our mobile applications on iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) have to interact with our computer servers. We assign your device a token so that you do not have to log in every time you use the Service via our mobile apps.
</p>
<p>
You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some of our Service features may not work properly without cookies. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. For more information about cookies visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information About Your Location.</strong>
From your IP address, we can tell generally where you are when you are accessing our Service, such as which city. We start by choosing a location for you based on the IP address of your Internet connection. You can update or remove this location at any time by logging in to your account on the Service.
</p>
<h3 class="secondary-heading uppercase">C. Personal Data and Information Third Parties collect automatically</h3>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Cookies for Site Use Analysis.</strong>
We use third parties such as Google to help us analyze how people are using our Service. We also use the Google Analytics service to provide us with demographic data about our Hosts and Members, such as age and gender. Google uses a cookie that can be recognized by Google or its affiliate DoubleClick when you visit other websites. For more information about how Google collects, uses, and shares your information, please visit the Google Privacy Policy-Partners website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Cookies Used to Target Ads to You When You Use the Service or are on Other Websites.</strong>
“Beacons” are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about website usage across websites and over time.  Our Hosts may use their own or third party cookies or beacons to target Host ads to you when you visit other websites.  Our Hosts may also work with other companies who use their cookies or beacons to target third party ads to you on other websites based on your prior visits to the Host’s Network on our website Service. This is called online behavioral advertising (“OBA”), because you receive ads based on your prior online behavior. We do not have access to these cookies; it is third parties who engage in OBA.
</p>

<div class="section-group">
<h3 class="secondary-heading uppercase">II. Our Sharing of your Personal Data and other information</h3>
