<h3>OUR POLICY</h3>
<p>Welcome to mightybell.com a web application made available by Mighty Software, Inc. (“Mightybell”, “we,” “us,” or “our”). We created this privacy policy to provide information about our company and its services that provide spaces (“Spaces”) to online groups for specific interests (together with our web application, the “Service”) to our users (“you,” or “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Mightybell’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”), and other information that is collected from visitors to our Application and users of the Service. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms of Service.</p>
<h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
<p>When you interact with us through the Service, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
<p>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Service: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access to the Service (for example, name and email address), use certain features of the Service, contact us with inquiries, or respond to one of our surveys. Wherever Mightybell collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. If you are a User, you agree to comply with this Privacy Policy. However, as a member of Spaces, you acknowledge that Mightybell cannot control the actions of other Users; if you have a privacy-related dispute with an User, you should contact the User directly.</p>
<p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Mightybell and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</p>
<p>Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data: When you interact with Mightybell through the Service, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information (including your age and location that you provide). Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Mightybell may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Mightybell affiliates, agents, or service providers. The Service may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Service, the total number of Users who join Spaces, the number of visitors to each page of our Service, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our Users use and interact with the Service. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the Users of the Service, Mightybell often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests, and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Mightybell may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its Users, affiliates, agents, and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. Mightybell may also disclose aggregated User statistics in order to describe our Service to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
<p>In operating the Service, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Service gives to your browser when you access the Service. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Service and help us analyze Service usage more accurately. For instance, our Service may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Service without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once when you are using the Service. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service’s features.</p>
<h3>OUR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Mightybell uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Service (including through any Integrated Services), we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Mightybell and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Service to help us improve the content and functionality of the Service, to better understand our users and to improve the Service. Mightybell and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you regarding the Service or to tell you about products or services that we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. Note however that as a User of the Service you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications.</p>
<p>If Mightybell intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>
<h3>OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Mightybell is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
<p>Hosts: If you participate in a Space created by another user of the Service, the Host may have access to certain Personal Data that you make generally available through the Service, such as your username, gender, age, location, and activity in their specific Space in which you are participating. The Host may also receive aggregate usage data related to your participation in a Space, such as when you accomplish an action in such Space and how you rated it.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
<p>Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Mightybell, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
<p>Legal Requirements: Mightybell may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Mightybell, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>
<h3>YOUR CHOICES</h3>
<p>Note that although you may be able to set your participation in a Space as non-visible to others, other members in a Space will be able to see that you are participating.</p>
<p>You can access the Service without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain features of the Service.</p>
<h3>EXCLUSIONS</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Mightybell other than Personal Data collected through the Service. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Mightybell through the Service or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Service, such as public forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Mightybell shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute, and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.</p>
<h3>CHILDREN</h3>
<p>Mightybell does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data through the Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Mightybell through the Service, please contact us and we will look to delete that information from our databases.</p>
<h3>LINKS TO OTHER WEB APPLICATIONS</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service. The Service may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Mightybell (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Service do not imply that Mightybell endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>
<h3>INTEGRATED SERVICES</h3>
<p>One of the special features of the Service is that it allows you to enable various online third party services, such as social media and social networking services like Facebook and Twitter (“Integrated Services”), to integrate directly into your Mightybell Space. By directly integrating these services, we make your use of Mightybell richer, and more personalized. To enable this feature, we may ask you to authorize Mightybell to access the Integrated Services. When you add an Integrated Service account to the Service, your login information and other relevant information necessary to enable the Service will be passed through to the Integrated Service to access that Integrated Service and your data contained within that Integrated Service. We may import, use, disclose, and retain such data and information to, among other things, customize and improve the Service for you, your friends, and others. Note that Integrated Services may also import, use, and retain this information. You may control how certain information is shared with us in your privacy settings within the Integrated Services. However, please remember that the manner in which Integrated Services use, store, and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such third parties, and Mightybell shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Integrated Service that may be enabled within the Service.</p>
<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<p>Mightybell takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Service from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email, or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.</p>
<h3>OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
<p>Your access to and use of the Service is subject to the Terms of Service at mightybell.com/tos.</p>
<h3>CHANGES TO MIGHTYBELL’S PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>The Service and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Mightybell to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Mightybell reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Service after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Mightybell has no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Integrated Service that may be enabled within the Service.</p>
