included in Log Data.</p> 


<p><b>Links:</b> MightyText may keep track of how you interact with links in Updates by redirecting clicks

to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p> 

<p><b>Cookies:</b> Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect additional website usage data and
to improve our Services, and to authenticate users. A cookie is a small data file that is

<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

a third party web client to access your MightyText account.</p> 

<p><b>Service Providers:</b> We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide
services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent
necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations
mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.</p> 
<p><b>Law and Harm:</b> We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to
comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud,
security or technical issues; or to protect MightyText's rights or property.</p> 
<p><b>Business Transfers:</b> In the event that MightyText is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition,
reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction.
The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p> 
<p><b>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</b> We may share or disclose aggregated or
otherwise non-personal information, such as usage patterns or link click statistics</p>

personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.</p> 
<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3> 
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will
govern our use of your information and will be at <a href="/privacy">http://mightytext.net/privacy</a>.
If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you
via your MightyText client or to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access
or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
