  </p>
  <h2>1.2 Third Party List Information.</h2>
  <p>Miracle Phytoceramides. collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and Miracle Phytoceramides. subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller").

  </p>
     <h2>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</h2>
  <p>Miracle Phytoceramides. currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database.

  </p>
       <h2>(a) Cookies.</h2>

Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.
  </p>
      <h2>(b) Web Beacons.</h2>
  <p>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- seehttp://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Miracle Phytoceramides. to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Miracle Phytoceramides. might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Miracle Phytoceramides.'s database, visits the fishing website, Miracle Phytoceramides. receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the fishing site, and Miracle Phytoceramides. would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in fishing. Miracle Phytoceramides. may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Miracle Phytoceramides. also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Miracle Phytoceramides.'s database.
