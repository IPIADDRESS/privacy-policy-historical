      <p>
      Welcome to mIRC. We want you to know that we respect your privacy and
      value your trust. We have written this privacy policy to let you
      know about the personal information, if any, that we collect about you
      when you use the mIRC website or the mIRC software, and what we do with
      that information.
      </p><p>
      </p><h2 class="topic">What information do we collect?</h2>
      <p>
      </p><h2 class="topic">Use of cookies</h2>
      <br>
      A cookie is a small amount of data that your browser stores on your
      computer on behalf of the website that you are visiting. This allows
      a website to remember details about your visit, such as your preferences
      or the pages you have visited, and to provide useful features based on
      those details. The mIRC website uses cookies in a number of places, such
      as on the Registration page while processing your order or in the
      Discussion Forums while you are browsing or creating posts. If adverts
      are being displayed on the website, they may also use cookies for similar
      reasons.
      <p>
      </p><h2 class="topic">Log Files and IP Addresses</h2>
      <br>
      As with all websites, visits to the mIRC website are logged by IP
      address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages,
      platform type, date/time stamp, and the number of pages visited. We do
      not share this information with any other organizations. We may
      occasionally use it ourselves to monitor the status of the website
      however. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable
      information although visitors should be aware that both static and
      dynamic IP addresses can be mapped back to most ISPs.
      <p>
      </p><h2 class="topic">Names and Email addresses</h2>
      <br>
      We collect your email address when you subscribe to the mIRC mailing
      list and when you create an account on the mIRC Discussion Forums. We
      also collect your name and email address when you register mIRC.
      <p>
      In the case of the mailing list, your email address is used solely for
      the purpose of emailing you when a new version of  mIRC is released.
      We honour all unsubscribe requests and you can remove yourself from
      the mailing list at any time through the unsubscribe link on the
      <a href="mailing.html">Mailing List</a> page.
      </p><p>
      In the case of the Discussion Forums, your email address is used solely for
      the purpose of allowing you to use your Discussion Forums account and is
      not used for any other purpose.
      </p><p>
      In the case of when you register mIRC, your name and email address
      are used to provide you with your mIRC registration information after
      you have registered mIRC and for no other purpose.
      </p><p>
      In all of the above cases, we will not sell, share, or rent this
      information to any other organizations.
      </p><p>
      </p><h2 class="topic">Securing your information</h2>
      <br>
      We take every reasonable precaution to protect any information that
      we collect from you from unauthorized access, misuse, or loss. Although
      we cannot absolutely guarantee that this won't happen, we have strict
      policies in place to prevent it.
      <p>
      </p><h2 class="topic">Links to other sites</h2>
      <br>
      This website and the mIRC software contain links to other sites and IP
      Addresses. Please be aware that mIRC is not responsible for the privacy
      practices of other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to the
      information collected by mIRC.
      <p>
      </p><h2 class="topic">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <br>
      We may occasionally need to update our privacy policy and if we do we
      will post any changes to the policy on our website so that you are
      always aware of how we use your information. If at any time we find
      that we need to use information in a manner different from the
      policy stated at the time the information was collected, we will notify
      users by email and/or by posting a notice on our website.
      <p>
      </p><h2 class="topic">Questions</h2>
