<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Car Connectivity Consortium LLC ("Car Connectivity " or "We") is committed to user privacy in our products and services. This online privacy policy outlines our information-handling practices for both personal information and non-personally identifiable information for the www.carconnectivity.org and www.terminalmode.org websites (collectively, the “Site” or "Car Connectivity Website"). This policy applies only to transactions with, and information gathered from, the Car Connectivity Website and related services, and does not apply to activities unrelated to the Car Connectivity Website. By using the Car Connectivity Website, you agree to accept the practices and terms set forth in this privacy policy. We encourage you to read this privacy policy and those of all websites that you visit.</p>
<p>For each visitor to Car Connectivity’s Site, Car Connectivity’s Web server may recognize, collect and/or store information such as the visitor’s IP address/domain name combination, and any referring sites to keep track of the origin of our visitors and other non-personally-identifiable information, that will help administer the Car Connectivity Website and to help diagnose any problems that may occur with our server. The non-personally identifiable information we may gather includes the type of browser that you use and IP address, the content that you access and the length of your visit to the Car Connectivity Website. Car Connectivity uses this information, typically in aggregate form, to improve the operation of the Car Connectivity Website and organization, analyze interest in the areas of the Car Connectivity Website and to personalize and similarly tailor content displayed to users. We may also release aggregate information about user trends to partners and other third parties. An example of this type of information would be patterns of use of the Car Connectivity Website based on geography or industry. We also retain aggregated log files of requested content in order to report overall usage and to evaluate user trends. If you wish to be removed from our email reports list, click on the link to “unsubscribe” at the bottom of any message and you will be immediately unsubscribed.</p>

<p>We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our privacy policy. We sometimes release beta versions of our website and related services, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because the website and services are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so.
