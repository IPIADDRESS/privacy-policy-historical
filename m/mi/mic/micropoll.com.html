offers, and how it is best utilized. As always, you have the option
not to receive these types of communications (see 'Choice and

third parties except as indicated below.</p>
<p>If a user specifically requests a service from one of our
partnering companies, their personally identifying information will
be shared. The partnering company may contact them directly
regarding their inquiry. Any requests of partnering companies are
initiated solely by the user and it will be clearly indicated that
a partnering company offers the requested service.</p>

When you request live chat support, your contact information will
be stored by Tender as necessary for them to provide that service.
Tender is prohibited from using your personally identifiable
information for any other purpose. (Tender Privacy Policy: <a href="http://tenderapp.com/privacy.html">http://tenderapp.com/privacy.html</a>)</p>

goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or
use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive our product updates, you may
opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in
each product update email.</p>
<p><strong>Web Analytics</strong></p>
<p>We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics
that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information
about visitors to our site in aggregate form. This information
includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet
service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system,
date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual
users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users'
movements around the site and to gather demographic information
about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to
identify the country of origin of the user. This information is
used to facilitate the use of the service and our multi-lingual
options.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's
computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site.
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any
personally identifiable information you submit while on our
site.</p>
<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use
session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and
validate that you have logged into your administrative account. A
session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent
cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided
in your Internet browser's 'help' file.</p>
<p>If you reject cookies, the site will not function properly after
logging in to your administrative account.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Gifs</strong></p>
<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which
emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the
effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of
our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these
emails, please see 'Choice and Opt-out'.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Personally Identifiable
Information</strong></p>

no longer desire our service, you may update or cancel your account
at any time by logging into the system and clicking on the 'My
Account' link. Options for updating your profile and account
cancellations are available here.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information such as credit card number on
our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket
layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the
personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and
once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore,
while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those
changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem
appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect,
how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose
it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any
time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes
to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a
notice on our homepage.</p>
