                    Authentic Sites like microcenter.com use a VeriSign Secure 
                    Server Digital ID to offer proof of identity, to enable secure 
                    communications and to encrypt translations with site visitors 
                    through their web browser connections. The only way to be 
                    sure of a web site's authenticity is to view the site's Digital 
                    ID. Viewing a site's ID assures that you are not being "spoofed" 
                    (i.e. the site is real and not an imposter) since it contains:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The name of the company which owns the web site (e.g.

                    <li>The name of the Secure Server Certification Authority 
                      under which VeriSign issued the Digital ID (RSA Data Security 
                      or VeriSign)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>To view Micro Electronics, Inc.'s Digital ID when you enter 
                    the checkout page, follow these steps for your browser:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 and later: Click on the

                  <p>When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information, such as financial information, you will be redirected to a secure server and we will notify you, depending on the type of browser you are using, through a pop-up screen or a yellow "padlock" icon displayed in the lower portion of the browser window. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you via this site.<br>
