  Authentic Sites like microcenter.com use a VeriSign Secure 
                    Server Digital ID to offer proof of identity, to enable secure 
                    communications and to encrypt translations with site visitors 
                    through their web browser connections. The only way to be 
                    sure of a web site's authenticity is to view the site's Digital 
                  ID. Viewing a site's ID assures that you are not being "spoofed" (i.e. the site is real and not an imposter) since it contains:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The name of the company which owns the web site (e.g.

                  <p><span class="headline_red">How do we protect the security of your Micro Center Online order information?</span><br>
                    Micro Electronics, Inc. and Micro Center Online are concerned about your privacy and the security of your important personal information. We always use industry standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving any data that you exchange with our site. We employ the same industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology that is used by major banks and stock brokerage firms to conduct business via the Internet. This encryption procedure "scrambles" the information you send us and makes online transactions extremely safe.</p>
                  <p>When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information, such as financial information, you will be redirected to a secure server and we will notify you, depending on the type of browser you are using, through a pop-up screen or a yellow "padlock" icon displayed in the lower portion of the browser window. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you via this site.<br>
                    <br>
                    For complete details, please see our <a href="safe_shopping.html">Safe Shopping Promise</a>.<br>

                    This site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly or intentionally obtain any personally identifiable information from any person we know to be under the age of 13.</p>

                  <p><span class="headline_red">How am I notified of Privacy Policy changes?</span><br>
                    As we continue to grow our businesses and improve our services, we reserve the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If there are changes or additions, we will post those changes here or in other formats we deem acceptable, so that you are aware of such changes. If this Privacy Policy changes in such a way that your personally identifiable information may be used or shared in a different manner, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of having your information used or shared in that new manner. If you are concerned about how your information is used, please check back at this site periodically. </p>
                  <p><span class="headline_red">Disclosure exceptions:</span><br>
                    Notwithstanding the above policies, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to appropriate third parties if we are required to do so by law or we believe that such action is necessary: to comply with legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order; to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website and/or Micro Center Online; to protect Micro Electronics, Inc.’s rights and property; or during emergencies, such as when we believe someone’s physical safety is at risk.</p>
                  <p>In addition, as we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer information, email addresses, and visitor information are generally among the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution, including, but not limited to, a bankruptcy proceeding.</p>
