            <p><span class="headline_red">How do we use cookies and technology in our website?</span><br>
              Micro Center  Online sets a cookie on your computer to record certain information during your  online visit (session). No personally identifiable information is stored within  this cookie. The benefit to you is the ability to save items added to your  shopping bag and store them on our server for future reference (up to 30 days).  These cookies do not gather sensitive information like your name, address,  credit card number, etc., if you do not specifically give that information to  us voluntarily. If you have given us that information, cookies enable us to  recall it (and save you the trouble of entering it all over again) each time  you visit our site.</p>
            <p>Our web server collects the addresses of the web sites that  visitors came from before visiting our site, which browser was used to view our  site and search terms entered on our site. Without making use of any personally  identifiable information, we may track the pages visited to help us understand  how customers use our site. This helps us make decisions on how to create a  better experience for you in the future.</p>
            <p>At your option, if you delete our cookies, you will limit  our ability to personalize the site for your next visit. However, deleting a  cookie will not prevent you from visiting our site and making purchases.</p>

              Micro   Center retail stores and Micro  Center Online may provide your name, address and email address to reputable  organizations that help us to fulfill services to you on our behalf.

We may provide these marketing partners personally  identifiable information obtained from you, and this information may be  combined with other personally identifiable information, such as demographic  information, available from our records and other sources. However, we will NOT provide any of your  financial or credit card transaction information or phone numbers to our  marketing partners. &nbsp;Also, we will NOT  provide your email address to our marketing partners unless you have given your  authorization by checking “Subscribe” to “Marketing Partners” on the <a href="https://f.microcentermail.com/asbs/servlet/SS?F=2790827">preferences page</a> of this website. &nbsp;We will not otherwise re-sell or distribute your  email address to any third party.&nbsp;</p>
