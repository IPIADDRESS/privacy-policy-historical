            <h1 align="left"><b>Internet Privacy Statement</b></h1>
            <p align="left"><b>INTRODUCTION:</b> USFSI and its franchised properties 
              has a strong commitment to providing excellent service to all of 
              our customers, including respecting their concerns about privacy. 
              We understand that visitors to our website may have questions about 
              whether and how this website collects and uses information. Accordingly, 
              we have prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy principles 
              that govern usfsi.com (including bestinn.com, hawthorn.com, and 
              microtelinn.com). Use of this website by you will be deemed as your 
              acknowledgment and acceptance of this privacy statement.</p>
            <p><b>BROWSING:</b> Visitors who browse this website do so on an anonymous 
              basis. We have not configured this website to collect any information 
              from your computer without your input. This means that, unless you 
              voluntarily and knowingly provide us with information, we will not 
              know your identity, your e-mail address, or any other information 
              identifiable to you.</p>
            <p><b>INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP) ADDRESS:</b> An IP address is a number 
              that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse 
              the Internet. When users request a page from our site, our servers 
              log the user’s current IP address. We use IP addresses to help 
              diagnose problems. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally 
              identifiable. Thus, each user session is anonymous.</p>
            <p><b>INFORMATION:</b> When we need to collect information from you, 
              we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we 
              need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one 
              of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, 
              telephone number, e-mail address, credit card type, credit card 
              number, expiration date and room preference (non-smoking room or 
              no preference) to process your reservation. We will use your e-mail 
              address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the 
              other information to contact you for help to process the reservation. 
              When we ask you for personal data when making a reservation or purchasing 
              a gift certificate, including your name, address and credit card 
              data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line 
              provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet 
              Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This ensures that your information 
              is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is 
              enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer. 
              You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock icon in the 
              lower right hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked 
              position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first 
              characters of the site address with change from "http" 
              to "https". After information reaches us it is stored 
              on a secure server that resides behind a firewall that is designed 
              to block access from outside the Company.</p>
            <p>We may also ask you to fill out an online customer survey, to obtain 
              your suggestions or comments about your use of our services, or 
              for similar purposes. Providing this information is voluntary. We 
              also, at times, may use an interactive dialogue product to assist 
              visitors while on certain web pages. The content of the dialogue 
              is not identifiable to you unless you voluntarily provide us with 
              your name or other information regarding your identity. The dialogue 
              product is used only to facilitate your visit by providing the additional 
              information you request, and the content will not be stored and 
              used by us except for quality assurance and statistical analysis 
              purposes, so that we can better anticipate our prospective customers' 
              needs.</p>
            <p><b>USFSI USE OF INFORMATION:</b> We treat the information you provide 
              to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to 
              our company's security procedures and strict corporate policies 
              regarding protection and use of confidential information. Because 
              laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels 
              or other business operations may put in place additional measures 
              that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information 
              is generally processed and stored in the United States, in which 
              data protection laws are not as comprehensive as in the European 
              Union.</p>
            <p>Information gathered is used only for the purpose for which the 
              information was collected and is not used or shared with other companies 
              not affiliated with USFSI. The personal information you provide 
              to us for making a reservation is made available to the applicable 
              hotel for the purpose of meeting your reservation request. If you 
              cancel your reservation, the information is stored for recordkeeping 
              purposes only and is not accessed again. After completing your stay 
              at a Best Inn, Hawthorn, or Microtel hotel, the information you 
              provide may be used for direct marketing by a Best Inn, Hawthorn, 
              or Microtel hotel. USFSI may use the services of a third party mail 
              house for the sole purpose of mailing materials. </p>
            <p><b>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION &amp; OPT-OUT:</b> USFSI will not 
              sell, trade, rent or release such information to entities outside 
              of the USFSI family of companies and hotels, for their use without 
              your approval and giving you the opportunity to opt-out.</p>
            <p>Links to Other Sites: If you choose to leave this site via links 
              to other non-USFSS, Best Inn, Hawthorn, or Microtel hotel sites, 
              including those of advertisers, we are not responsible for the privacy 
              policies or content of those sites, nor are we responsible for the 
              cookies those sites might deposit on your hard drive.</p>
            <p><b>LEGAL ISSUES:</b> USFSI and its franchises will disclose personal 
              information when required by law or in good faith belief if such 
              action is necessary or desirable to comply with the law, protect 
              or defend the rights or property of USFSI, the site or its users.</p>
            <p><b>PRIVACY STATEMENT CHANGES:</b> In the future, we may need to 
              change the privacy statement for usfsi.com and our franchised properties. 
              All changes will be made here so that you will always know what 
              information we gather, how we might use that information and whether 
              we will disclose it to anyone. Changes in the privacy statement 
              will only affect our treatment of information supplied by you to 
              us following the effective date of such changes, i.e., for information 
              supplied by you prior to the change in the privacy statement, we 
              will continue to honor the obligations of the privacy statement, 
              for such information, in effect when the information was originally 
              supplied by you. Information entered or re-entered following a change 
              in the privacy statement will be governed by the new privacy statement.</p>
            <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Your privacy concerns are important to us. We 
              hope this privacy statement has been helpful to you. If you have 
              any questions about this privacy statement or privacy concerns send 
              an e-mail to <a href="mailto:webmaster@usfsi.com">webmaster@usfsi.com</a>.</p>
