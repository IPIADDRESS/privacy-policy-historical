<h2>Collection of your Personal Information</h2><p>We will ask you when
we need information that personally identifies you (personal
information) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry
out a transaction that you have requested such as receiving information
about Microsoft products and services, entering a contest, ordering
e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site or service,
signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing, downloading
and/or registering Microsoft products. The personal information we
collect may include your name, title, company or organization name,
work e-mail, work phone, work or home address, information about your
job function, information about your company, and credit card
information. </p><p>The Site may collect certain information about
your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the
Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet;
the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while
at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you
linked directly to our site. This information is used to help improve
the site, analyze trends and administer the site. Some of our sites
collect information about your hardware and software in order to
provide a requested service. Windows Update, for example, needs to know
information about your computer in order to recommend needed operating
system updates.</p><p>Microsoft technical communities provide
opportunities to interact with Microsoft employees, experts, and your
peers in order to share knowledge and news about Microsoft products and
related technologies. In order to avoid your e-mail address or other
personal information from being gathered and used by others for
inappropriate or harmful purposes, Microsoft advises that you should be
cautious about posting a real e-mail address or other personal
information to newsgroups, chats, or other public forums. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/privacy.mspx">Read more</a> about guidelines for safe use of Microsoft technical communities. </p><div style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><a href="#top"><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/library/gallery/templates/MNP2.Common/images/arrow_px_up.gif" alt="Top of page" border="0" height="9" width="7"></a><a class="topOfPage" href="#top">Top of page</a></div><a name="E1B"></a><h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2><p>The
personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the
Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you
have requested or authorized.</p><p>In support of these uses, Microsoft
may use personal information to provide you with more effective
customer service, to improve the Site and any related Microsoft
products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating
the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by
customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests. In
order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions
with Microsoft, information collected by Microsoft.com may be combined
with information collected by other Microsoft services.</p><p> We may
use your personal information to provide you with important information
about the product or service that you are using, including critical
updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may
send you information about other Microsoft products and services,
and/or share information with Microsoft partners so they may send you
information about their products and services.</p><p>We merge
site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for
research purposes, and we may use this information in aggregate to
provide more relevant content. In some limited-entry sections of
Microsoft.com, with your approval, we will combine site-visitation data
with your personal information in order to provide you with
personalized content. If you decline permission, we will not provide
you the personalized service and won't merge your personal information
with site-visitation data.</p><p>When you sign up for a newsletter or
agree to receive promotional e-mail, Microsoft.com may use customized
links or similar technologies to track e-mail links that you click. We
may associate that information with your personal information in order
to provide you more focused e-mail communications or purchase
information. Each e-mail communication includes an unsubscribe link
allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication.</p><p>Some
services on Microsoft.com offer individuals the ability to publicly
display certain personal information, such as for a Microsoft partner
who wishes to publish contact information as part of offering a
business service. Participation in such services is always optional. </p><p>Microsoft
occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our
behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering
prizes, answering customer questions about products and services, and
sending information about our products, special offers, and other
services. We will only provide those companies the personal information
they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the
confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that
information for any other purpose. </p><p>Microsoft may disclose
personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith
belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of
the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the Site;
(b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and our
family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the
personal safety of Microsoft employees or agents, users of Microsoft
products or services, or members of the public. </p><p>Personal
information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the
United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its
affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using
the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of
your country. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set
forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use,
and retention of data from the European Union.</p><div style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><a href="#top"><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/library/gallery/templates/MNP2.Common/images/arrow_px_up.gif" alt="Top of page" border="0" height="9" width="7"></a><a class="topOfPage" href="#top">Top of page</a></div><a name="EHC"></a><h2>Control of your Personal Information</h2><p>Except

purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you
time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a

We may share aggregated site statistics with partner companies.</p><p>You
