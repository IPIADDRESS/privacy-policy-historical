</ul>
<p>3. COOKIES AND TARGETED ADVERTISING</p>
<p><b>A. Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Address Information</b></p>
<ul>
<li>“Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website places on your browser when you visit that website. Ricebunny, Inc. may use cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Site and Services. For example, Ricebunny, Inc. may use cookies to control what advertisements you see, the sequence of advertisements and to make sure you don’t see the same advertisement too many times. For contests or sweepstakes, Ricebunny, Inc. may also use cookies in order to track your progress and the number of entries in some promotions. For polls, Ricebunny, Inc. may use cookies to help ensure that an individual can’t vote more than once on a particular question or issue. Ricebunny, Inc. does not store Personal Information in any cookies on your computer.</li>
<li>Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser’s directions within the help tab. In order to use certain Services offered through the Site, your web browser must accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of the Site may not work properly, and you may not be able to access Ricebunny, Inc.’s Services.</li>
<li>Ricebunny, Inc. may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened, or on which advertisements you clicked.

For example, if you read an article on one of the Site, Ricebunny, Inc. may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a product related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on Ricebunny, Inc.’s Sites with information about pages you visit on other websites and show you advertising based on this combined information. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of this Site, another Site or any other website on the Internet if the website also has a relationship with Ricebunny, Inc.’s vendor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>C. Information Collected by Third Party Advertisers</b></p>
<p>Advertisers or other third parties on the Site may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use cookies and web beacons in the manner described above. Ricebunny, Inc. does not control these advertisers or other parties’ use of cookies or web beacons or what they do with the information they collect. Many third party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp"><b>NAI OPT-OUT</b></a>&nbsp;website and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices"><b>DAA CHOICE PAGE</b></a>&nbsp;and follow the instructions.
