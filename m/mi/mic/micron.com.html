<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>This Privacy Policy applies to all Web sites owned and operated by 
Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Micron"), other than Micron's 
Crucial Technology division whose Privacy Policy may be viewed <a href="http://www.crucial.com/store/privacy.asp">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Micron is committed to protecting your right to privacy when visiting our Web 
sites. We recognize that when you share your personal information with us, you 
expect us to treat that information in a serious and responsible manner. This 
Privacy Policy discloses what information we gather, how we use that 
information, and how you can correct or change that information.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>Micron's sites have security measures in place 
to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our 
control, including without limitation protecting information behind a firewall 
within a perimeter network and encrypting your ordering information during 
transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Registration and Order Forms</strong><br>If you choose to register 
with Micron or to place an order with us, we may ask that you provide us with 
contact information (first and last name, email address and telephone number), 
financial information (account or credit card numbers), demographic information 
(address, age, or income level), and unique identifiers (tax ID number), 
information about where you learned of our products and information about your 
intended use of our products. We may use your contact information to send you 
information about us and to contact you when necessary. If you do not want to 
receive any mailings from us, please see the choice/opt-out section below. 
Financial information is used only to bill you for products. Demographic 
information may be used to tailor your experience at our sites, showing you 
information that we think you might be interested in, and presenting information 
according to your preferences. We may use demographic information to develop 
summary - but not individual - reports for our advertisers so that they may 
determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our 
advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements, unless you 
have specifically told us that this is acceptable. In addition, our sales and 
marketing departments may also use demographic information, information about 
where you learned of our products and information about your intended use of our 
products to improve our advertising and marketing efforts and to measure 
interest in our products. We may use unique identifiers to verify our resellers 
and customers and to allow customers to identify themselves to us.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys and Contests</strong><br>Micron may invite you to participate 
in online surveys or contests. Participation is never required. If you choose to 
participate, you may be asked to disclose contact and demographic information as 
well as additional information about you and/or your company. We may use this 
information to send you information about our company, contact you when 
necessary, tailor your experience at our site, display information according to 
your preferences and improve our Web sites, products and advertising. If you do 
not want to receive any mailings from us, please see the choice/opt-out section 
below. This information may be shared with our advertisers on a summary, not 
individual, basis. </p>
<p><strong>Public Forums</strong><br>Micron's sites may make chat rooms, forums, 
message boards, and/or news groups available to you. Because any information 
that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, you should exercise 
caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Information Requests</strong><br>You may be able to request 
information on our sites regarding our products and services, including 
technical support and customer service, by using online forms. We ask that you 
provide certain contact information to allow us to fulfill your request and to 
send you information about Micron's products and services. If you do not want to 
receive any mailings from us, please see the choice/opt-out section below.</p>
<p><strong>Children's Guidelines</strong><br>Micron's sites are not geared 
towards children. Micron does maintain a few Web pages designed to provide young 
people educational and charitable information. On all Micron sites, Micron 
attempts to protect children. Micron must, however, rely on the information 
provided to us by visitors to our sites. As a result, it is impossible for us to 
guarantee with absolute certainty that the information collected and utilized by 
Micron is or is not derived from a child. The following sets forth Micron's 
policy with respect to the collection and/or use of children's information:</p>
<ul><li>For purposes of this Policy, a “child” is an individual age 12 or younger. 
</li><li>We do not collect children's contact information without prior parental 
consent, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the 
information and participation in the activity. Without prior parental consent, 
online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request 
and for no other purpose. 
</li><li>We do not collect children's personally identifiable offline contact 
information without prior parental consent. 
</li><li>We do not distribute children's personal information to any third party 
without prior parental consent. 
</li><li>We do not provide the ability to publicly post or otherwise transmit 
information that could be used to identify a child without prior parental 
consent. 
</li><li>We do not entice children by the prospect of a special game, prize or other 
activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the 
activity.</li></ul>
<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong> <br>We may use your IP address to help diagnose 
problems with our servers, administer our sites, and gather broad demographic 
information to measure general interest in our products and to share with our 
advertisers on a summary, not individual, basis. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies </strong><br>Our Web servers may place small bits of text or 
"cookies" onto your computer's hard drive and memory. Cookies enable us to 
identify you so you do not have to re-enter certain information each time you 
visit our sites and allow us to keep track of your shopping choices.</p>
<p>Often we use third-party services to help us measure the effectiveness of our 
Web site. Specifically, we use WebSideStory. This company may place third-party 
cookies on your hard drive to help us analyze the traffic on our Web site and 
better meet our customers' needs. This does not give Micron or any other company 
access to your personal information or other information on your computer. We do 
not track or store any personally identifiable information. If you are 
concerned, you can set your browser to decline third-party cookies, or you can 
delete these cookies from your hard drive. To learn more about our partnership 
and their privacy policies, or to opt out of receiving cookies from them, go to 
<a href="http://websidestory.com/privacy">http://websidestory.com/privacy</a></p>
<p><strong>Agents</strong><br>We may employ other companies and individuals to 
perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering 
packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from 
customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search 
results and links (including paid listings and links), and providing customer 
service. </p>
<p><strong>Supplemental Information</strong><br>We may supplement the 
information that you provide with information that is received from third 
parties. For example, Micron may use information that we purchase from a 
database marketing information firm to enhance our understanding of the 
information that you provide.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>Micron's sites contain links to 
other sites. Micron is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content 
of such Web sites.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong><br>Our sites provide you with the opportunity 
to opt-out of receiving communications from us at any point where we request 
information. If you do not want to receive future communications from us, please 
either go back to the site from which you no longer wish to receive such 
communications or contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@micron.com">privacy@micron.com</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Correct/Update</strong><br>If you want to change or modify 
information you have previously provided to us, please either go back to the 
site where you provided such information or contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@micron.com">privacy@micron.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting the Web Site</strong><br>If you have any questions about 
Micron's Privacy Policy or the privacy practices of our sites, please contact us 
by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@micron.com">privacy@micron.com</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Updates/Effective Date</strong><br>Micron reserves the right to amend 
this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes to the Policy will apply to 
information we have already received and information we receive after the 
revised Policy is effective. When we do amend this Policy, the revised Policy 
will be posted here so please visit this Web site to view the most current 
Policy. The effective date of this version of the Privacy Policy is: September 
28, 2005.</p>
