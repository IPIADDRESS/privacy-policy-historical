          </p><p class="HeadTags">Information we collect </p>

          <p><strong>Legal  Requests.</strong> <br>
            <br>
            We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to  enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to  help protect you and the community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a  verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a  criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize  us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, UserID  history, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history without a subpoena.  Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our  ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise  disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government  officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal  procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of  information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss;  or report suspected illegal activity. Further, we can (and you authorize us to)  disclose your name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone  number, email, and company name to Intellectual Property right's owners under  confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or  appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property  infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.</p>

          <p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot  ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information  will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

Therefore, although we use  industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you  should not expect, that your personal information or private communications  will always remain private.
