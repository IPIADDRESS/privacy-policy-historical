                                               We collect two 'types' or categories of information about you:
<br>
1. The first type is information that personally identifies you. For example, your full name (your first name and your surname), your home (or work) address, your e-mail address, telephone number and postcode. We call this 'personally identifiable' information.
<br>
2. Other information you give us, by itself, is NOT personally identifiable i.e. that we cannot link to an identified person. For example, whether you are male or female, the times and dates you use are services, the country in which you live, the language you normally speak in, the number of children you have... We call this 'non-personally identifiable information' or 'aggregate' information.

				<p>
					<strong>• Use of IP Addresses</strong>
				</p>
				<p>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. Web servers, the big computers that 'serve up' Web pages, automatically identify your computer by it's IP address. Euro Disney collects IP addresses for the purpose of system administration, and to create reports and to audit the use of our site. When you request pages from Disneyland Paris site, our servers or computers log the guests IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a member remains anonymous to us.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>• Use of Cookies</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						<br>
					</strong>Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes.</p>
