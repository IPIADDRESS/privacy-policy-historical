Services. If at any point you do not agree to any portion of the Privacy Policy then in effect, you must
immediately stop using the Services.</p><hr><p><strong>Revision to the Privacy Policy.</strong> We may revise this Privacy Policy in our sole discretion, so please

Policy on this web page, and the revised version will be effective immediately when it is posted (or upon

Information that you have provided to that Third Party application may be collected and/or you may specifically
authorize Mix to access certain information from such Third Party application. The information we obtain may
depend on the privacy settings you have with the Partner Community or Third Party application and the
information obtained may not be visible in your account. If you personalize your Mix account, we will also
collect any information you provide, such as your full name, your photo or avatar and any optional information
you decide to supply about yourself and your interests. We will first seek your specific permission before we
gain any access to your contacts should you wish to enable sharing through the Services.</p><p><strong>Non-Identifying Information.</strong> We also collect some Non-Identifying Information about you and your
interests as you navigate through and interact with our Services.. We may also receive Non-Identifying
Information about you and your interests from other sources like Third Parties that add to their websites Mix

automatically collect information through the Services. We use Technologies that are essentially small data
files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a

our Sites, Services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small text files placed in visitorsâ computer browsers to store their
preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Site may not

enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a Third Party or
hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the
company providing it.</li><li><strong>Analytics.</strong> We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest
Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services,
and to develop website content. This analytics data is not tied to any Personal Information. For more

designed to be compatible and used on mobile devices. Mix will collect certain information that your mobile
device sends when you use such Services, like a device identifier, user settings, location information, mobile
carrier, and the operating system of your device. Mobile versions of Mixâs Services may require that users log
in with an account. In such cases, information about use of mobile versions of the Services may be associated

</p><hr><h5>When Does Mix Share Information with Others, and with Whom?</h5><p><strong>Sharing Via Your Mix Account.</strong> The information provided in your Mix account that you select to be
publicly displayed will be public information and any User will be able to view it. You may edit or hide
information in your profile at any time so that it is no longer accessible to the public, but even if you
delete your data, it may continue to exist within or displayed via the Services and/or be shared by other
Users. Also, when you enter any information (including Personal Information), into postings or comments via the
Services, this information, may be available to some, a subgroup of, or even all Users of the Services,
depending on how and where this information was posted by you and with whom you have elected to share the
posting or comment.</p><p><strong>Aggregate Information &amp; Non-Identifying Information.</strong> We may share aggregated information that does
not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with
Third Parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, advertising, marketing and other purposes relating
to our Services. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.</p><p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may employ Third Party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to
provide the Services on our behalf, to perform maintenance and research services, or to assist us in analyzing
how our Services are used (such as infrastructure providers, database management, web or mobile analytics and
improvement of the Servicesâ features).</p><p><strong>Business Transfers &amp; Affiliates.</strong> Mix may share Personal Information with our business partners, and
affiliates for our and our affiliatesâ internal business purposes or to provide you with a product or service
that you have requested. Mix may also provide Personal Information to business partners with whom we may
jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such
cases, our business partnerâs name will appear, along with Mix. Mix requires our affiliates and business
partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain
on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which Mix provided them.</p><p>If Mix or the assets of Mix are acquired by another company, or if Mix is involved in financing due diligence
processes or transition of service to another service provider, then we may transfer your information,
including Personal Information, in connection with that acquisition or sale or transaction and Mix will direct
the recipient of this information to assume the rights and obligations described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>We also may share your information with affiliates in the same corporate family as Mix.</p><p><strong>Marketing â Interest-Based Advertising and Third Party Marketing.</strong> Through our Services, we may allow
Third-Party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your
activities (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified
information as well as selected Personal Information (such as demographic information) we have collected with
Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information
collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Mix
related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as âinterest-based advertisingâ
or âonline behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Site to facilitate
transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you. If you
prefer that we do not share your Personal Information with Third-Party advertising partners, you may opt-out of
such sharing at no cost by following the instructions in the âHow do I Opt Out?â below.</p><p><strong>Compliance with Laws &amp; Law Enforcement.</strong> We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal
Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i)
comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena;
(ii) respond to your requests; (iii) protect your, our or othersâ rights, property, or safety; (iv) to enforce
Mix policies or contracts; (v) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm
or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal
activity; or (vi) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.
</p><hr><h5>How Do I Opt Out?</h5><p><strong>General.</strong> You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information.
Where you have consented to Mixâs Processing of your Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any
time and opt-out to further Processing by contacting us <a href="mailto:support@mix.com">here</a>. Even if you
opt-out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Sites and/or
information from the advertisements on Third-Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such
as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p><p><strong>Email.</strong> If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom
of the email to opt-out of receiving future emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after
receipt. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or services you
have requested. We may also send you certain non-promotional communications regarding Mix and our Services and
you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms or
this Privacy Policy).</p><p><strong>Mobile Devices.</strong> Mix may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications and
other notices that may be of interest to you. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of
communications by changing the settings on your mobile device. Mix may also collect location-based information
if you use our mobile applications. You may opt-out of this collection by changing the settings on your mobile
device.</p><p><strong>âDo Not Track.â</strong> Do Not Track (<strong>âDNTâ</strong>) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain
web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information
about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do
not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.</p><p><strong>Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising.</strong> As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of
cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please
note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices,
application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.</p><p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads
from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can
access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/âmanaging/âopt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/âmanaging/âopt_out.asp</a>,
or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a> and
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/âchoices/">www.aboutads.info/âchoices/</a>. You can also choose not to be
included in Google Analytics <a href="mailto:support@mix.com">here</a>.</p><p>To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must
be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on
your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on
each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this
Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by
advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the
advertising partnersâ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
</p><hr><h5>How Can I Access, Rectify, Erase, and Restrict My Information?</h5><p>You may inquire as to whether Mix is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal
Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where
otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an e-mail here or use any of the methods set out in this
Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal
Information held about you by Mix. Please include your full name, email address associated with your account,
and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.</p><p>Although Mix makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there
may be circumstances in which Mix is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the
information contains legal privilege, would compromise othersâ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the
burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individualâs privacy in
the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Mix determines that access should be
restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has
been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Mix will take commercially
reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal
Information.
