				<h2 class="col-title">OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</h2>
				<p>
					Protecting consumer privacy is very important to us. Our Online Privacy Statement is available to
					inform you about our collection and use of personal information so that you can make informed
					choices about how your own information is collected and used. This Online Privacy Statement reflects
					the Mixcat.com policies covering personal information collected at this website on or after the
					effective date shown above.
				</p>

				<p>
					We believe that information used responsibly benefits consumers and the economy, whether it is
					information we house on behalf of consumers conducting transactions or information we collect on
					behalf of our business clients. For example, we use consumer information every day to ensure fast
					and accurate processing of hundreds of thousands of money transfers. In addition, Mixcat.com
					strives to better serve our customers by offering goods and services that we believe fit their
					needs and interests. When identifying an opportunity, Mixcat.com may use consumer information it
					has collected in an effort to identify consumers who may be interested in that opportunity.
				</p>

				<p>
					For	more than few years, consumers and businesses have relied on Mixcat.com for safe and reliable
					service. The relationships we have developed through the years have been established based on
					mutual trust. Each day we and employees and agents strive to reinforce our commitment to our
					clients and consumers. Central to that commitment is ensuring that we abide by a set of privacy
					policies, which are outlined below. These policies guide us in the collection and use of information
					as well as employee responsibilities in protecting your privacy. We use personal information about
					consumers only in a manner consistent with these policies.
				</p>


				<h2 class="col-title">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>
				<p>
					Mixcat.com collects personal information in order to offer or provide goods and services to consumers
					and our customers. We may obtain this information from a variety of sources:
				</p>

				<ul class="ul-list">
					<li>Directly from customer applications, questionnaires and other materials submitted to us by customers;</li>
					<li>From transactions in which Mixcat.com and consumers are involved;</li>
					<li>From clickthru activity on our web sites; and</li>
					<li>From a variety of third-party sources, such as our business customers, government repositories, consumer reporting agencies and other financial institutions.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="col-title">DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>
				<p>
					Mixcat.com does not disclose customer information to third parties without first giving customers an
					opportunity to opt-out of certain kinds of disclosures. There are some disclosures to third parties
					that are not subject to the opt-out, such as disclosures necessary to effect, administer or enforce
					a transaction requested by you, to companies that perform services for us or to prevent fraud.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, Mixcat.com may disclose information about former customers to third parties and companies with
					which Mixcat.com is affiliated, as well as unaffiliated third parties. Those disclosures may consist of
					the following:
				</p>

				<ul class="ul-list">
					<li>Financial background information describing a customer's financial status;</li>
					<li>Identification information, such as name and address data;</li>
					<li>Transaction information, such as account activity, debit activity or credit activity; and</li>
					<li>Other information relating to financial matters.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="col-title">RECIPIENTS OF INFORMATION</h2>
				<p>
					Mixcat.com may disclose consumer information to companies affiliated with Mixcat.com and to companies
					or other parties not affiliated with Mixcat.com (subject to consumers' opt-out rights). These recipients include:
				</p>

				<ul class="ul-list">
					<li>Financial institutions, such as banks, credit card companies and brokerage houses;</li>
					<li>Companies that process transactions or provide other services for us;</li>
					<li>Government agencies; and</li>
					<li>In addition, under United States law Mixcat.com is permitted to disclose customer information to certain recipients, like credit reporting.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><b>WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF CONSUMER INFORMATION.</b></p>

				<p>
					Mixcat.com limits access to personal information to those employees of Mixcat.com and its affiliates who
					need it to fulfill their business responsibilities. Employees must adhere to Mixcat.com privacy policies.
					Employees violating these policies may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.
					Vendors and other outside contractors we engage are subject to our contractual requirements to ensure that
					sensitive personal information is safeguarded.
				</p>

				<p><b>WE USE APPROPRIATE SECURITY SAFEGUARDS.</b></p>
				<p>
					At Mixcat.com, security is a priority. We employ appropriate measures to protect consumer information against
					unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. These may include, among others, encryption,
					physical access security and other appropriate technologies. Mixcat.com continually reviews and enhances its
					security systems, as necessary.
				</p>

				<p><b>
					WE MAINTAIN PROCEDURES TO ASSURE THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE WILL INFORM
					CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN ACCESS THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND MAKE CORRECTIONS, IF NECESSARY.
				</b></p>
				<p>
					Mixcat.com employs appropriate measures to assure the quality of information we collect directly from
					consumers. Where Mixcat.com collects information directly from consumers or sources other than our business
					customers, we permit them, if possible, to dispute or correct any erroneous or out-of-date personally
					identifiable information. Of course, this correction would not be possible if the information is proprietary
					to one of our business customers, reflects historical transaction information or if correction would violate
					the privacy or legal rights of a third party. Where applicable, we abide by laws related to such information.
					You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a written request
					that credibly shows error. We reserve the right to independently verify claims made. To protect your privacy
					and security, we also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before making corrections. We
					reserve the right to assess a service charge for providing you any information in connection with your request.
				</p>

				<h2 class="col-title">Mixcat.com IS NOT DIRECTED AT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13</h2>
				<p>
					Our website is not directed at children under the age of 13 and Mixcat.com does not collect or maintain
					information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13.
				</p>

				<h2 class="col-title">WEBSITE MAY BE LINKED TO OTHER WEBSITES</h2>
				<p>
					Mixcat.com may create links to third party websites. Mixcat.com is not responsible for the content or privacy
					practices employed by websites that are linked from our website.
				</p>

				<h2 class="col-title">OPT OUT RIGHT</h2>
				<p>
					Mixcat.com may disclose consumer information to third parties as described earlier in this notice. Many of
					these disclosures are beneficial to consumers because they permit goods and services of interest to consumers
					to be offered to consumers at attractive rates. We strive to give consumers choices about how their data will
					be used. You have the right to opt-out of (direct us not to make) these disclosures when the consumer
					information is about you. Of course, there are some disclosures to third parties that are not subject to the
					opt-out, such as disclosures necessary to effect, administer or enforce a transaction requested by you, to
					companies that perform services for us or to prevent fraud. When you use this service, you will be asked
					whether you wish to opt out. If you wish to opt out, simply check the appropriate box and submit your choice.
				</p>

				<p>
					We may alter this statement as needed for certain products and services and to abide by local laws or
					regulations around the world. Mixcat.com reserves the right to amend or modify this statement from time to
					time. We urge you to review this statement whenever you visit in order to obtain the most current statement.
					You may change your choices at any time.
				</p>
