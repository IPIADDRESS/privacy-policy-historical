	<h1 class="sectiontitle">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
	<div class="legal-text">
	
<p>This privacy policy sets out how Mixcloud Limited ("Mixcloud" or "we", "our" or 
"us") uses and protects any information that you give Mixcloud when you use 
www.mixcloud.com (the "Website").</p>
<p>Mixcloud is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you 
to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this 
website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this 
privacy statement.</p>
<p>Mixcloud may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You 
should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any 
changes. This policy is effective from 1st January 2009.</p>

<h3>1. Personal Information</h3>
<p>In order to use certain features of the Website, you will need to register. When 
registering you will be asked to provide an email address and create a username and 
password. You may also choose to create a more detailed profile of yourself on the 
Website by submitting additional personal information. Please note that even if you 
do not provide any additional personal information to the Website (e.g. by adding it to 
your user profile), if you choose a username that includes or reveals your name or any 
other personal information, such information may be available to other users of the 
Website and to the general public. For purposes of this Policy, the terms "personal 
information" and "personally identifiable information" shall mean all information 
provided during your initial registration on the Website and during your creation of a 
user profile, including, for example, your real name, e-mail address, postal address 
and other location information, your age, your gender and certain other demographic 
information or information that may enable online or offline contact with you.
From the moment you register and begin listening to music on Mixcloud, we will 
monitor your activity on the website and log this information in our databases. This 
includes which cloudcasts you listen to, when you listen to them, how long you listen to 
them for, which cloudcasts you favourite and so on. We will also monitor and log your 
music sharing activities. This information relating to your listening and music sharing 
activities can be viewed by all other users of Mixcloud. Mixcloud may make some of 
this information available to third parties to undertake development of new products 
and services via an API.</p>
<p>If you choose to purchase music or other goods or services by clicking on a third party 
link provided on the Website (for example, a link to Amazon.com), such third party 
may collect your personal details (such as your credit card number, address, etc.) for 
the purpose of completing a transaction. We may be provided with confirmation of 
your transactions with such third parties and, in some instances, such confirmation 
may include your personal information. Aside from such confirmations, the only 
information that we will collect with respect to such third party links is: (a) the 
number of generic Mixcloud users who utilised such links; and (b) the number of 
purchases made by these generic users.</p>
<p>Where you upload photographs or other content as part of your user profile, you 
should be aware that Mixcloud is entitled to use those photographs and content in 
accordance with our Terms of Use. Mixcloud discourages users from uploading 
photographs of friends or other people without their permission.

</p><h3>2. Location-based Information</h3>
<p>We keep track of the domains from which people visit Mixcloud, but we cannot see a 
user's zip code, post code, city or country unless the user chooses to explicitly provide 
this information to us. If you do choose to include information about your city or 
country of residence when setting up your user profile, please be aware that such 
information may be available for viewing by other users of the Website and to the 
general public.</p>

<h3>3. Browser Information</h3>
<p>We collect data regarding the users of Mixcloud, including: (i) The Internet Protocol 
(IP) address of the user's computer. This may or may not be associated with a 
particular Internet Service Provider (ISP); (ii) The referring URL, if any; (iii) The 
browser software identification (i.e. the brand and version of your browser software).</p>

<h3>4. Use of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We will use the email address provided by you when you register to contact you from 
time to time. This may be for security reasons (so that we can check that you are who 
you say you are), to ask your opinion about the Website, or it may be to keep you 
updated on the services currently available on the Website and any changes to those 
services and those that we intend to launch in the future. We may also use such 
personal information to send you notices, on behalf of others and ourselves, regarding 
products and services that we think may be of interest to you.
Mixcloud may also use your personal information and non-personal information to 
help Mixcloud and its commercial partners deliver targeted advertisements, 
promotions and other similar initiatives to you.</p>
<p>Your username, together with other information concerning your use of the Website, 
as well as any personal information included in your user profile, may be made 
available via Mixcloud's open application interface (the "API").</p>
<p>We will not permit any third parties to contact you directly on an unsolicited basis in 
relation to their own products or services, unless you have provided your express prior 
consent when signing up on the Website. You may withdraw your consent by 
notifying us at legal@mixcloud.com.</p>

<h3>5. Security</h3>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent 
unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic 
and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 
You should never disclose your account password to unauthorised people. We use 
certain security measures to help keep your personal information safe, but we cannot 
guarantee that these measures will stop any users try to get around the privacy or 
security settings on the Website through unforeseen and/or illegal activity. 
Consequently, you acknowledge that there are circumstances in which your personal 
information may be accessed by unauthorised persons.</p>
<p>In the event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our 
possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If a 
notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under 
the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you 
by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you 
prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at 
legal@mixcloud.com with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.</p>

<h3>6. Comments / Communications With Other Users</h3>
<p>We currently offer the functionality to comment on content and other users on 
Mixcloud. In the future we may offer other interactive features. Please note that all 
personal information you display or communicate using such functionality becomes 
public information and we are not responsible for any information you choose to 
make public. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor such traffic via electronic 
software or otherwise in order to check for obscenity, defamation or abusive 
language, which we reserve the right to remove at any time. In addition, if you choose 
to personally communicate or meet with any other Mixcloud user by exchanging 
postal/email addresses, telephone numbers or otherwise via the interactive 
functionality of Mixcloud, you do so at your own risk. Mixcloud cannot be held 
responsible for any consequences which flow from your decision to communicate or 
interact with other Mixcloud users in places or under circumstances which we do not 
control. We advise you to use extreme caution whenever you post information, 
socialise or interact with people whom you have met via the internet.</p>
<p>From time to time, you may be able to send to a friend or to another service, and a 
friend or contact may be able to send to you, information about our Website or 
services (e.g. to recommend a show), by clicking on a "share this" or similar button 
on the Website or other third-party websites. </p>

<h3>7. How we use cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard 
drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or 
lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to 
respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your 
needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your 
preferences. </p>
<p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us 
analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to 
customer needs. We also use cookies to identify you as a valid user and to help 
personalise your Mixcloud experience in conjunction with your profile.
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor 
which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us 
access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose 
to share with us. </p>
<p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept 
cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you 
prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>

<h3>8. Links to other websites</h3>
<p>Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. 
However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do 
not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for 
the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such 
sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy policy. You should exercise 
caution and look at the privacy policy applicable to the website in question.</p>

<h3>9. Data Protection</h3>
<p>Mixcloud complies with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the "Act"), including UK 
amending legislation and E.U. Directives. Pursuant to the Act, you have the right to 
be informed of, and to have access to, all of the personally identifiable information we 
hold about you, and you may do so by visiting your user profile when logged-in to 
your account on the Website, or by e-mailing us at: legal@mixcloud.com. A small fee 
may be payable.</p>
<p>We may store information provided by you on our servers both in the U.S. and in the 
U.K.</p>

<h3>10. Transfers of your Information</h3>
<p>We may use third-party partners to help operate our Website, and we may share your 
information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide 
products or services for or through this Website or for our business (such as Web site 
or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service 
providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and 
other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf).
Mixcloud operates an 'open API' and webservices program, which enables 
developers and other third parties to freely use statistics and data collected by 
Mixcloud to create programs and other interesting services which help develop the 
Mixcloud community. </p>
<p>Certain third party individuals or organisations may have access to your personal 
information (excluding your email contact information) via Mixcloud's API and 
webservices or as a result of agreements between Mixcloud and its preferred partners. 
(However, you should be aware that if you provide your e-mail contact information 
and/or username directly to any such third parties, they may use your information for 
their own purposes.) Such partners may use such information for their own purposes, 
which may be either commercial or non-commercial in nature and which may include 
targeted advertising or direct marketing. These third parties may be based in the 
United Kingdom or elsewhere (including outside of the EEA).</p>
<p>Certain third-party advertisements on the Website may enable you to submit your 
username and/or other personal information within the advertisement in order to 
receive information or services provided by third parties. Such advertisements are 
provided by third parties, and thus, the collection and use of information submitted 
via the advertisements is by such third parties and is subject to their privacy policies.
Mixcloud cannot guarantee that all third parties will abide by such restrictions. Of 
course, you can report any suspected misuse of your personal information to us by 
emailing us at legal@mixcloud.com and we will endeavour to investigate your claim. 
Where we deem it appropriate, we will take appropriate action against such third 
party, which may include terminating their access to personal information.</p>

<h3>11. Third-Party Ad Servers</h3>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to target and serve ads when you visit 
our Website. These companies may use information (generally not including your 
name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other 
Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to 
you. These companies may employ cookies and other tracking technologies to 
measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via 
cookies is generally not personally identifiable (unless, for example, you provide 
personal information to them through an ad or e-mail message). We encourage you to 
read these businesses' privacy policies if you should have any concerns about how 
they will care for your information. If you would like more information about this 
practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these 
companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer Web site at 
http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer.</p>

<h3>12. Mixcloud Policy for Young People</h3>
<p>Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use the Website and must not attempt 
to register with Mixcloud and/or submit any personal information to us. We don't 
knowingly collect personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or 
allow them to register. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data 
from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information as quickly as 
possible. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact us at 
legal@mixcloud.com, and we will delete all relevant information.</p>
<p>We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 17 should not send any 
information about themselves to anyone over the Internet (including to us) without 
asking their parents/legal guardians for permission beforehand.</p>

<h3>13. Legally-Compelled Disclosures</h3>
<p>We believe in privacy and therefore will take all reasonable measures to ensure that 
your personally identifiable information remains private. However, in the event that 
we are required to disclose personally identifiable information by a court, the police 
or other law enforcement bodies for their investigations, regulation or other 
governmental authority we will make such a disclosure without being in violation of 
this Policy.</p>

<h3>14. Business Transitions</h3>
<p>If Mixcloud is acquired by another company or sells all or a portion of its assets to 
another company, or in the event of a merger, it is likely that user information will be 
a part of the assets transferred. If as a result of such a business transition information 
is to be collected, used or disclosed in a manner or for a purpose different from that 
stated above, Mixcloud will endeavour to notify all users of such changes beforehand.</p>

<h3>15. Consent</h3>
<p>By disclosing any information to Mixcloud through the Website and by using the 
Mixcloud Website as a registered user, you are consenting to the collection, storage 
and use of your personal information by Mixcloud as set out in this Policy and the 
Terms and Conditions, and you understand and consent to the collection, 
maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States 
and other countries and territories. If you do not consent to the collection, 
maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States 
and other countries and territories, then you should not use the Website as a registered 
user, which means that many features will be unavailable to you.
When you give your personally identifiable information to Mixcloud, it may be used 
by Mixcloud and its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries for the purposes of, 
for example, providing you services and sending you correspondence, and 
additionally may be transferred to entities other than Mixcloud's affiliates, which 
entities may be located in countries outside the EEA, including the United States. 
Each of these countries has different privacy laws that afford varying levels of 
protection for your personally identifiable information, and such laws may not be as 
comprehensive as those that exist in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). By 
registering with Mixcloud, you consent to Mixcloud's and its direct and indirect 
consolidated subsidiaries' transmission to, and processing of your information in, any 
jurisdiction, in accordance with its Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>16. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>If Mixcloud makes any changes to this Policy these changes will be detailed on this 
page in order to ensure that you are fully aware of what information is collected, how 
it is used and under what circumstances it will be disclosed. If you are concerned 
about how your information is collected, used or disclosed, you should periodically 
check back at this page. If you have any specific concerns not addressed in the Policy, 
please contact us using the feedback page on the website.</p>
<p>If you decide that you do not want your personal information to be used in the way 
described in this Policy, you can send us a notice that you wish to withdraw your 
consent as set out above by emailing legal@mixcloud.com. If you do not provide 
your consent, or if you withdraw your consent, you should not use the Website as a 
registered user, which means that many features will be unavailable to you.</p>
