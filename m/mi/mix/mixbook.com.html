    <h1 class="bottom-border">Mixbook's Privacy Policy </h1>
    <span class="subtitle">This policy is effective December 18, 2008.</span>
    <br>
<p>Mixbook’s Privacy Policy is designed to help you:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Understand what information we collect and how we collect, share, and use the information; and</li>
  <li>Make informed decisions when using the services located at www.mixbook.com (“Mixbook” or “Web Site”)</li>
</ul>
<p>By using or accessing Mixbook, you are accepting the  practices described in this Privacy Policy, as modified by us from time to time.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">The Information We Collect</h2>

<p>When you visit Mixbook, you provide us with two types of  information:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li><strong>Personal       Information</strong> that you knowingly choose to disclose through various Web       Site features.<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>Web       Site Use Information</strong> that is collected by us as you interact with our       Web Site.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bottom-border">Personal Information You Provide to Us</h2>

<p>We collect "Personal Information" that you submit  to us voluntarily through our Web Site:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>When       you register with Mixbook, you provide certain Personal Information,       including your name, email address, and password.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>When       you create a profile on the Web Site after registering, you may provide material       that may contain Personal Information, such as a personal photo, email       address, or a “headline.”</li>
  <li>When       you post any material (such as User Content) on the Web Site, you may be       providing Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
  <li>When       you order products or services on Mixbook, you provide Personal Information       necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card       information, shipping information and billing information.</li>
  <li>When       you contact us to give feedback or ask a question using the forms on the       Web Site, you provide your name, email address and your comment, question       or feedback.</li>
  <li>When       you participate in our surveys, we may collect additional Personal Information.</li>
  <li>When       you contact us by sending us an email, we will collect your email address,       any Personal Information contained in the email, and any Personal Information       attached to the email.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bottom-border">Web Site Use Information</h2>

<p>When you access Mixbook, we collect  non-personally-identifiable information including your browser type, operating  system, domain names, and IP Address.&nbsp; We  use different types of technologies to collect this information, including  single-pixel GIFs. In addition, we store certain information from your browser  using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied  to information about the user.&nbsp; We use  session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in.&nbsp; These cookies terminate when the user closes  the browser.&nbsp; Under other circumstances,  including if you select the “Remember Me” option upon login, we use a  persistent cookie, for example, to store your login ID (but not your password)  to allow you to automatically login when you come back to Mixbook. You can set  your browser to refuse cookies; however, if you do so, some or all of the Web  Site may not function properly or at all.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">User Content and Other Information</h2>

<p>When you use Mixbook, you may form relationships, send  messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit Personal Information  through various channels.&nbsp; We collect Personal  Information related to these services so that we can provide you the service  and offer personalized features.&nbsp; In most  cases, we retain the Personal Information so that, for instance, you can view a  list of your friends or see the books you are currently contributing to.&nbsp; When you update your Personal Information, we  sometimes keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of  time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p>
<p>You post Personal Information in User Content (as defined in  Mixbook's <u><a href="/main/terms">Terms of Use</a></u>) on the Web Site at your own risk.&nbsp; Although we allow you to set privacy options  that limit access to your books, please be aware that no security measures are  perfect or impenetrable.&nbsp; We cannot  control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your books  and Personal Information.&nbsp; Therefore, we  cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Web Site will not  be viewed by unauthorized persons.&nbsp; We are  not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures  contained on the Web Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after  removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived  pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on  Mixbook is a violation of the Mixbook Terms of Use and should be reported to <a href="mailto:privacy@mixbook.com">privacy@mixbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell friends  about our Web Site or invite them to collaborate on a book, we will ask you for  your friend’s email address. &nbsp;Your friend  will automatically be sent a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Web  Site. Mixbook stores information gathered during this process to register a  friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of  our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mixbook.com">support@mixbook.com</a> to request that we remove your  friend's information from our database.</p>
<p>By using Mixbook, you are consenting to have your personal  data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">Use of Information Obtained by Mixbook</h2>

<p>In general, information you submit to us is used either to  respond to requests that you make or to aid us in serving you better, including  to fix technical problems, provide administrative services, and monitor  traffic, the number of visitors, and the effectiveness of programs. &nbsp;We may use aggregated user data to market the  Web Site to others. &nbsp;We may provide these  services ourselves or share the information with partners who will provide the  services for us. </p>
<p>We may use your Personal  Information to provide you with newsletters and surveys and to notify you of  important changes to the Web Site, new services, and special offers.&nbsp; If you do not want to receive such email notices,  you may login to your account at the Web Site and opt out of receiving such  email or  send email to <a href="mailto:privacy@mixbook.com">privacy@mixbook.com</a> or mail to Privacy, Mixbook, 409 Sherman Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94306. Opting out may prevent  you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or special  offers.&nbsp; If we have provided any third party with your information,  you will have to contact the third-party directly with any opt-out  request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Profile information is used by Mixbook primarily to be  presented back to and edited by you when you access Mixbook and to be presented  to others you permit to view that information. </p>
<p>Your name, headline, a thumbnail of your photo, and  thumbnails of your most recent books will be available in search results across  Mixbook to allow your friends to find you and send a friend request.&nbsp; People who see your name in searches will be  able to access your profile or other personal information.</p>
<p>User Content in your profile, including the books you create  or contribute to, will be displayed to users with whom you have a relationship  through your profile, search results and various other pages on the Web Site.&nbsp; In addition, the title, page count, thumbnail  photo, description, author and list of contributors of your books will be  visible to all users of Mixbook depending on the privacy settings of those  books.&nbsp; If your book is set to be  viewable by only your friends or only a specific list of users, it will not  appear in search results by people who do not have permission to view it.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Mixbook will send you service-related announcements from  time to time through the general operation of the service.&nbsp; For instance, if a friend sends you a new  message or you receive a request to collaborate on a friend’s book, you may  receive an email alerting you to that fact.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">Feedback</h2>

<p>If you provide feedback on any of our products and services  to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate  such feedback with your Personal Information. Mixbook will collect any  information contained in such communication and will treat the Personal  Information in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">Children Under Age 13</h2>

<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) defines personal information as "individually identifiable information," including things like a first and last name, a street address, an email address, or a telephone number. COPPA places requirements on websites that collect such information from children. You must be at least 13 years or older to register and use this Service. If you are under the age of 13, you must use an account created by a parent or guardian, and you must have the explicit permission of a parent or guardian to use the Service.
</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</h2>

<p>We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their  parents before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the  internet.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h2>

<p>Mixbook is all about collaborating and sharing information  with others – your friends on the Web Site and people you share it with.&nbsp; We allow you to choose privacy settings for  the books you create with your friends on the Web Site. These settings allow  you to make an informed choice about who has access to the information and  content that you create on or upload to the Web Site.&nbsp; We do not sell your Personal Information to  third party marketers without your permission. We share your Personal Information  with third parties only in limited circumstances. &nbsp;We comply with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and  intend to do business only with companies that also comply.&nbsp; <strong>We  will not sell your Personal Information to anyone we think is a spammer.</strong> </p>
<p>Unlike most sites on the Web, Mixbook  limits access to Web Site information by third party search engine “crawlers”  (e.g., Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask). The Web Site is set up to block access by  these engines to personal information beyond your name, profile picture and  headline.</p>
<p>We may provide collected information to service providers to  help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties  to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location  facility for servers, to send out email updates about Mixbook, to remove  repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or  services, to print the books that you order, or to provide search results or  links. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service  providers may have access to your Personal Information for use for a limited  time in connection with these business activities.&nbsp; Where we utilize third parties for the  processing of any Personal Information, we implement reasonable contractual and  technical protections limiting the use of that information to Mixbook-specified  purposes.&nbsp; If we provide any of the information  collected from you with a third party, their use of that information will be  governed by their privacy policy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example: when you place an order for a printed copy of a  book on Mixbook, your billing information is transmitted to a third-party  credit card processor and your shipping information is transmitted to third-party  printer to be printed, bound and shipped to you.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to  lawful requests, such as subpoenas, law enforcement investigations, or court  orders, or in compliance with applicable laws.&nbsp;  We also may release information to protect its rights, property, or  other interests, including those of its customers or other third parties or to  prevent illegal activities or violations of the Mixbook Terms of Use. &nbsp;This may include sharing information with  other companies, lawyers, agents, or government agencies.</p>
<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Mixbook  business, or individual business units owned by Interactive Memories, Inc.,  were to change, information may be transferred to the new owner so the service  can continue operations.&nbsp; We may also  transfer information if we partner with another company.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">Links</h2>

<p>Mixbook may contain links to other web sites. We are of  course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We  encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Web Site to read the  privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally  identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information  collected via Mixbook.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">Changing or Removing Information</h2>

<p>Access and control over most Personal Information on Mixbook  is readily available through your account settings.&nbsp; Mixbook users may modify or remove their  information through the <u>My Account</u> page.&nbsp;  Information will be updated immediately.</p>
<p>If you make use of the communication features of the service  to share information with other individuals on Mixbook(e.g., sending a message),  you generally cannot remove or edit such communications. Mixbook may delete  your information from its system, at its sole discretion, at any time.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">Security</h2>

<p>Mixbook takes precautions to protect our users’ Personal Information;  however, no precautions are 100% effective.&nbsp;  As a result, Mixbook does not guarantee that Personal Information you  provide to us will remain secure.&nbsp; Your  account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because  email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we  request that you not send private information to us by email or instant  messaging services. If you have any questions about the security of the Mixbook  Web Site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mixbook.com">privacy@mixbook.com</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">Terms of Use, Notice and Revisions</h2>

<p>If you choose to visit Mixbook, your visit and any dispute  over privacy is subject to the then-current Privacy Policy and our <a href="/main/terms">Terms of  Use</a>, including limitations and damages, arbitration of, and application of law  of the state of California.&nbsp; We reserve  the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time by posting any changes on  the Web Site. All changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on  the Web Site.&nbsp; If we make changes, we will  indicate at the top of the page the policy’s effective date. We therefore  encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you  understand our current privacy policy. Your use of the Web Site after any  changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy  Policy.&nbsp; Unless stated otherwise, our  current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and  your account.</p>

  <h2 class="bottom-border">Contacting Mixbook</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please  contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mixbook.com">privacy@mixbook.com</a>.&nbsp; You may also contact us by mail at 409 Sherman Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94306.</p>
