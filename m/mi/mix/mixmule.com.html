<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact
	us.</p>
<p>By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your

	time, we may update the Privacy Policy and we will post a notice of
	significant changes on the website MixMule.com. You should visit
	this page periodically to review any such changes to the Privacy

</h4>
<p>We use your name, email address and other information on our system
	to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and to
	solicit your feedback and input.</p>
<p>You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and the
	contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a good faith
	belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably
	necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as a
	search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our
	rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the public. SHORT_SITE	may also delete certain content in whole or in part if SHORT_SITE	determines, in its sole discretion, that such content constitutes an

	information about you that is on its system following your termination.
	Contact SHORT_SITE to terminate your account or for any other questions
	about your personal information.</p>
<br>
<h4>
	<span class="peach">Transfer of Information</span>
</h4>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the
	event of a transfer of ownership of SHORT_SITE, such as acquisition by or
	merger with another company. In such an event, SHORT_SITE will notify you
	before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a
	different privacy policy.</p>
<br>
<h4>
	<span class="peach">Links to Other Sites</span>
</h4>
<p>SHORT_SITE may contain links to other web sites. These other sites

	yourself.</p>

<h4>
	<span class="peach">Security</span>
</h4>
<p>
	We use industry standard security measures to protect your information
	so that it is not made available to unauthorized parties. If you have
