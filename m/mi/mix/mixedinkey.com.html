us at contact@mixedinkey.com if you have any questions. This Privacy Policy is designed to
help you understand our privacy practices and the choices available to you when you use our

<p><b>Location</b>. Your Personal Data may be stored and processed in the United States, Europe, or
any other country in which we, our subsidiaries, affiliates or Processors maintain facilities. We

proprietary software applications that are used to deliver the Services store your Personal Data

subject to human error is 100% secure. When you enter your log in credentials or other

secure socket layer technology (SSL). You can also prevent unauthorized access to the
Personal Data in your account with us by protecting your password appropriately and limiting
access to your device and browser by signing off after you have finished using our Service.

we will promptly notify you in compliance with applicable law.</p>

<h2>Children and Our Services</h2>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not
knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16. In the event that we
learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will delete that data
as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any data from or about a child under
16, please contact us at contact@mixedinkey.com.</p>

<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for
marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email, written or hard copy notice, or
through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by us in our sole
discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to
you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy
Policy.</p>
	
<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the
our Service or Sites, including the data or content contained therein. Please remember that
when you use a link to go from our Services or Sites to another website or service, our Privacy
Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any
third-party website or service, including those that have a link or advertisement on our website,
are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies.</p>
	
<h2>Social Media Widgets</h2>
<p>Our Site includes social media features, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Google+
and other widgets, that run on our Site. These features may collect your IP address and which
page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly
on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the
organization providing it.</p>
	
<h2>Do Not Track Disclosure</h2>
<p>"Do Not Track" ("DNT") refers to an HTTP header used by Internet web browsers to request a
web application disable its tracking or cross-site user tracking. When DNT is enabled, a user's
web browser adds a header to content requests indicating that the user does not want to be
tracked. Some U.S. state laws require us to disclose how we respond to web browser DNT
signals. We do not respond to or take any action with respect to a DNT configuration set in your
internet browser, and therefore, do not disable tracking. For data about Do Not Track, visit
www.allaboutdnt.org.</p>
	
<p>In addition, we deploy cookies, tracking pixels, web beacons, and other technologies on our
websites and those of our customers. Those tools may be used by us, our customers, and third
parties to collect data about you and your internet activity, even if you have turned on the Do
Not Track signal.</p>
				
<h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Sections 1798.83 – 1798.84 permits you to
request data regarding the disclosure of your Personal Data to third parties for the third parties’
direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered
user of any Services where this Privacy Policy is posted, California Business and Professions
Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content or data you have
publicly posted. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or
comprehensive removal of the content or data you have posted and that there may be
circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.
To make either of these requests, please send an email to contact@mixedinkey.com.</p>
	
<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>All changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. When we

this page.</p>
