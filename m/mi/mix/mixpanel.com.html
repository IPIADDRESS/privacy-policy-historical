<li>We may retain information on your behalf that you store using your Account, including postal address, phone number, fax number, company name and credit card payment information.</li>
<li>If you use our Services on your mobile device, including through our Application(s), we may collect your mobile carrier and the unique device id number.</li>
<li>If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may store and use that information for internal analytics purposes.</li>
<li>We may also collect personal information at other points in our Site that state that personal information is being collected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information Collected Via Technology</strong></p>
<p>We automatically collect certain information via technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you visit our Sites or use our Application(s), some information is automatically collected. This may include information such as the Operating System (OS) running on your device, Internet Protocol (IP) address (which may be used to obtain your geolocation), access times, browser type, and language, and the website you visited before our Sites. We also collect information about how you use Mixpanel’s Sites, Application(s) and Services, including the elements you have interacted with, metadata and other details about these elements, clicks, change states and other user actions.</li>
<li>We automatically collect certain information using “cookies” or similar technologies. Among other things, such technologies help us improve our Sites, our marketing activities and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to our Sites. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Sites and could remove cookies used for opt-out of tracking, including our Mixpanel opt-out cookie. If you would like to opt-out of our use of the Mixpanel cookie for tracking on our site,&nbsp;<a href="https://mixpanel.com/optout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a>.</li>
<li><u>Pixel Tags</u>. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages and determine whether those e-mails have been opened, to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ personal information.</li>
<li>We partner with a third party to display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click&nbsp;<a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>&nbsp;or if you are located in the European Union, click&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.</li>
<li><u>Mobile Services</u>. We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our Application(s). This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you and improve our Services and analytics platform. Examples of information that may be collected and used include how you use the Application(s) and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our Application(s) crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model and OS version, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Application(s).</li>
</ul>
