Identifiable Information</b>.  Animotion collects personally identifiable 
information through our web site.  This information is used in 
e-commerce transactions and to provide customer service and support. 
Our web site collects personally identifiable information at several 
points, including processes associated with password registration, license 
acceptance, feedback, purchasing services, account creation and e-mail 
opt-in.  Visitors may voluntarily provide (and we will collect) 
information including: name, email address, billing information, and 
purchase information. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#333333" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Cookies</b>.  
Animotion’s web site uses cookies. We use cookies in order to better 
understand our web site visitors’ needs.  A cookie is a small 
text file (which includes a unique identifier) that our server places 
on your computer’s hard drive.  Cookies enable us to track use 
patterns, repeat visitors, and deliver customized content to web site

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Log Files.</b> 
Like most standard web site servers we also use log files. Log files 
include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service 
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, 
and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' 
movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information 
for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable 
information. We use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze 
user movement.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#333333" size="3" face="Times New Roman">If 
you do not want Animotion to use your information as described in this 
Section 1, please follow the procedure in Section 3 (Changing Your Information;
