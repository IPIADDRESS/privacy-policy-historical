    <h3><a name="Children_Under_13"></a>Children Under 13:</h3>
    <p>Meredith cares about protecting the privacy of children.
      We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide
      us any personally identifying information. Children
      should always get permission from their parents before
      sending any information about themselves (such as
      their names, email addresses, and phone numbers)
      over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We encourage
      you to become involved in your children's online
      experience, and to share your interest in our sites
      with your young ones. If you're under 13, please
      do not register with any of our sites or provide
      us with any personally identifying information (such
      as your name, your email address or your phone number).
    </p><p><a href="#top"> Return to top</a>
    </p><h3><a name="Information_We_Collect"></a>Information We Collect:</h3>
    <p>The information we gather on our sites falls into two categories: (1) information you supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites. Third-party providers featured on, or linked to from, our sites, such as vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may gather information, as well.</p>
    <h4>Personally Identifying Information</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <p><strong>Registration Information.</strong> To use certain features on our sites, we ask you to register. When you register, we collect personally identifying information about you, including your name, mailing address, email address, user name and password. We may also ask for some additional information, such as, hobbies, age, browser type, and the like, but you're free to register without providing this information if you prefer. In addition, at various other points on our sites, we may ask you for personally identifying information, including when you: place an order for products, complete a survey, or report a problem with one of our sites. We use this information to process your orders, to tailor our sites to your interests and to make them more useful to you, and to help improve our sites generally.</p>
      <p><strong>Contests and Other Promotions.</strong> From time to time, we may offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or advertising partners. If you choose to participate in one of these contests or promotions, you'll have to provide some information about yourself (such as your name, address, and email address). We may share this information with sponsors of the contest or other promotional partners, but we will always identify the other parties involved (for example, in the contest rules) and provide notice that your registration may be disclosed to these parties. We don't control these third parties' privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection and use of your information. We urge you to review their privacy policies and learn how they will use your information before participating. If you don't want us to collect the information requested in connection with a promotion, or to provide it to our co-sponsors or partners, please do not participate in the promotion.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Tracking Information</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> To help us serve your
        needs better, we use "cookies" to store and
        sometimes to track user information. A cookie
        is a small amount of data that is sent to
        your browser from a web server and stored
        on your computer's hard drive. A cookie contains
        a unique number that allows our sites to
        identify your computer. For example, cookies
        allow us to keep track of your user name
        and password (if you are a registered visitor)
        so you don't have to re-enter that information
        each time you visit one of our sites. We
        also use cookies to make sure you don't see
        the same ads repeatedly when you visit our
        sites. The help function on most browsers
        contains information on how to set your browser
        to notify you before accepting cookies or
        to disable cookies entirely. However, if
        you don't accept cookies, you may not be
        able to take advantage of various features
        on our sites that are available to other
        visitors. In addition, our advertising and
        marketing partners may use their own cookies. </p>
      <p><strong>Third-Party Advertising Services.</strong> We
        use the services of DoubleClick, a third-party
        advertising and email delivery company
        to serve and target advertisements that you see
        on the pages of our sites, to serve and target
        promotions or other marketing messages, and to
        send e-mails from us. DoubleClick also collects "clickstream data," information about your visit to our sites and to third-party sites that can be aggregated and used to target advertising on this and other sites, and used for marketing research and other similar purposes. This clickstream data does not include personally identifying information such as your name, address, email address or telephone number. DoubleClick uses cookies for many of the same reasons we do, and collects information directly from our users. We share website usage information about visitors to our sites who have received a targeted promotional campaign with DoubleClick to facilitate targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and DoubleClick note some of the pages you visit on our website through the use of pixel tags (also called "clear gifs" or "web beacons"). If you would like to know more about DoubleClick information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures,
        please see the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;" target="_blank">DoubleClick website</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Browser Level Information and IP Addresses.</strong> When
        you use our sites, we may also collect
        information about your access time and your computer
        configuration, including the type of browser
        software you use, the operating system that you're
        running, the resolution of your computer monitor
        and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your
        IP address is a number that is used by computers
        connected to the Internet to identify your computer
        so that data (such as the web pages you request)
        can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell
        us who you are. Like the IP address, none of the
        other information described in this paragraph identifies
        you personally. We collect this information for
        purposes of aggregated reporting on site activity
        that we, and our advertisers, may use. For example,
        we may want to know how long the average user
        spends on our site, which pages or features get
        the most attention, and the like. The aggregated
        information helps to understand our audience and
        confirm the value of advertising on our websites.</p>

    <h3><a name="How_your_information_will_be_used"></a>How Your Information Will Be Used:</h3>
    <p>Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a customized experience when visiting our sites and to make our sites more valuable to you. </p>
    <div class="indent">
      <p><strong>Vendors and Service Providers.</strong> To
        make your experience on our sites more useful and
        enjoyable, we may offer some features (such as
        chat rooms and email newsletters) in conjunction
        with third party providers ("Provider Partners")
        that specialize in operating such services. We
        share with each of these Provider Partners such
        information as is necessary to provide you with
        the services we provide you in conjunction with
        that Provider Partner. Their use of this information
        will be subject to the terms of their respective

      <p><strong>Other Disclosures.</strong> We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our <a href="http://www.betterrecipes.com/terms">Visitor Agreement</a>, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our sites, the public, or Meredith Corporation.

    <h2><a name="Your_California_Privacy_Policy"></a>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
    <p><strong>(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</strong></p>
    <p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 – also known as the “Shine the Light” law –  California residents have a right to request certain information from each business they patronize regarding that business’s disclosures of personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  Generally, if a business has disclosed personal information regarding its California customers to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, the business is required to provide, upon request and free of charge, a list of the names and addresses of all such third parties, together with a list of the categories of personal information that was disclosed.</p>
    <p>The “Shine The Light” law creates an exception for businesses that adopt and disclose to the public (in their privacy policies) a policy of not sharing personal information for direct marketing purposes without offering their customers choices to prevent such disclosures.  These businesses are not obligated to provide the lists described above and may respond to requests from California customers by notifying them of their rights to prevent disclosures of personal information for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost-free means of exercising those rights.  </p>
    <p>Meredith Corporation qualifies for this latter exception.  As further explained in our <a href="#Online_Privacy_Policy">Online Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="http://www.bhg.com/bhg/file.jsp?item=/privacy/policy">Offline
        Privacy Policy</a>, we offer our customers choices to prevent the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  To prevent such disclosures of your information, please follow the instructions in our “Shine The Light” Customer Notice, which is included below for your convenience.  You can also request a copy of this Notice by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@meredith.com">privacy@meredith.com</a>.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request for per California customer during the course of any calendar year and we reserve the right not to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>

    <h2><a name="shinethelight"></a>MEREDITH CORPORATION "SHINE THE LIGHT" CUSTOMER NOTICE </h2>
