				  	<h6><a name="1" id="1">1. Children Under 13:</a></h6>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="margin:0 0 0 10px;">Meredith cares about protecting the privacy of children. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved in your children's online experience, and to share your interest in our sites with your young ones. If you're under 13, please do not register with any of our sites or provide us with any personally identifying information (such as your name, your email address or your phone number). </p>
				  <p style="text-align:right;"><a href="#">Return to top</a></p>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  <h6><a name="2" id="2">2. Information We Collect:</a></h6>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			      <p style="margin:0 0 0 10px;">The  information we gather on our sites falls into two categories: (1)  information you supply when you register or initiate transactions,  and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our  sites. Third-party providers featured on, or linked to from, our  sites, such as vendors of products and services offered through our  sites, may gather information, as well.</p>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			      <h6 style="margin-left:10px;">Personally  Identifying Information</h6>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			      <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Registration  Information.</strong> To use certain features on our sites, we ask you to register. When  you register, we collect personally identifying information about  you, including your name, mailing address, email address, user name  and password. We may also ask for some additional information, such  as, hobbies, age, browser type, and the like, but you're free to  register without providing this information if you prefer. In  addition, at various other points on our sites, we may ask you for  personally identifying information, including when you: place an  order for products, complete a survey, or report a problem with one  of our sites. We use this information to process your orders, to  tailor our sites to your interests and to make them more useful to  you, and to help improve our sites generally.</p>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			      <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Contests  and Other Promotions.</strong> From time to time, we may offer contests or other promotions  involving marketing or advertising partners. If you choose to  participate in one of these contests or promotions, you'll have to  provide some information about yourself (such as your name, address,  and email address). We may share this information with sponsors of  the contest or other promotional partners, but we will always  identify the other parties involved (for example, in the contest  rules) and provide notice that your registration may be disclosed to  these parties. We don't control these third parties' privacy  practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection  and use of your information. We urge you to review their privacy  policies and learn how they will use your information before  participating. If you don't want us to collect the information  requested in connection with a promotion, or to provide it to our  co-sponsors or partners, please do not participate in the promotion.</p>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			      <h6>Tracking  Information</h6>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			      <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Cookies.</strong> To help us serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to  store and sometimes to track user information. A cookie is a small  amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and  stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique  number that allows our sites to identify your computer. For example,  cookies allow us to keep track of your user name and password (if you  are a registered visitor) so you don't have to re-enter that  information each time you visit one of our sites. We also use cookies  to make sure you don't see the same ads repeatedly when you visit our  sites. The help function on most browsers contains information on how  to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to  disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you  may not be able to take advantage of various features on our sites  that are available to other visitors. In addition, our advertising  and marketing partners may use their own cookies. </p>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  
			      <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Third-Party  Advertising Services.</strong> We use the services of DoubleClick, a third-party advertising and  email delivery company to serve and target advertisements that you  see on the pages of our sites, to serve and target promotions or  other marketing messages, and to send e-mails from us. DoubleClick  also collects "clickstream data," information about your  visit to our sites and to third-party sites that can be aggregated  and used to target advertising on this and other sites, and used for  marketing research and other similar purposes. This clickstream data  does not include personally identifying information such as your  name, address, email address or telephone number. DoubleClick uses  cookies for many of the same reasons we do, and collects information  directly from our users. We share website usage information about  visitors to our sites who have received a targeted promotional  campaign with DoubleClick to facilitate targeting future campaigns  and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For  this purpose, we and DoubleClick note some of the pages you visit on  our website through the use of pixel tags (also called "clear  gifs" or "web beacons"). If you would like to know  more about DoubleClick information gathering practices and "opt-out"  procedures, please see the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;" target="_blank">DoubleClick  website</a>.</p>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			      <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Browser  Level Information and IP Addresses.</strong> When you use our sites, we may also collect information about your  access time and your computer configuration, including the type of  browser software you use, the operating system that you're running,  the resolution of your computer monitor and your Internet Protocol  ("IP") address. Your IP address is a number that is used by  computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that  data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP  address does not tell us who you are. Like the IP address, none of  the other information described in this paragraph identifies you  personally. We collect this information for purposes of aggregated  reporting on site activity that we, and our advertisers, may use. For  example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our  site, which pages or features get the most attention, and the like.  The aggregated information helps to understand our audience and  confirm the value of advertising on our websites.</p>

				   <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  <h6><a name="3" id="3"></a>3. How  Your Information Will Be Used:</h6>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                   <p style="margin:0 0 0 10px;">Our  primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a  customized experience when visiting our sites and to make our sites  more valuable to you. </p>
				   <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Vendors  and Service Providers.</strong> To make your experience on our sites more useful and enjoyable, we  may offer some features (such as chat rooms and email newsletters) in  conjunction with third party providers ("Provider Partners")  that specialize in operating such services. We share with each of  these Provider Partners such information as is necessary to provide  you with the services we provide you in conjunction with that  Provider Partner. Their use of this information will be subject to  the terms of their respective privacy policies, which you can find on  their websites. <em>We  will not provide your email address to such third parties unless it's  necessary to provide the services you have requested, or to allow you  to participate in a co-sponsored promotion.</em> </p><br>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Sites  to Which We Link.</strong> We also may provide links to other websites, and provide access to  products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy  policies we don't control. When you access another website or  purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through  our websites, use of any information you provide is governed by the  privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting or the  provider of such products or services. When you provide information  in the course of obtaining products or services through our sites,  use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy  policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it  appears that you're on one of our sites throughout the transaction.  The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find  the privacy policy of any of our providers via a link either from the  site's homepage or from the pages on which the products or services  are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more  information.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Shopping.</strong> When you are ready to make a purchase through one of our sites, we  will ask you to provide us with certain information, including your  contact details (such as your name, address, telephone and email),  and your billing information (such as your credit card number and the  date that your card expires). We will use the information you provide  us to process your transaction and to contact you regarding your  purchase if necessary. We will share this information with the  relevant merchant to the extent necessary to facilitate your purchase  (for purposes such as customer service, verification, fulfillment and  billing purposes). We may share non-financial information with such  merchants in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Our  Other Websites.</strong> When you register for one of our sites, the information that you  provide will be added to a centralized Meredith database so that you  will simultaneously be registered for our other sites as well. We may  share the information that we collect from you with other divisions  of Meredith so that we and they can offer you products and services  that we may believe may be of interest to you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Postal  Address Lists.</strong> If you provide us with your postal address, we may include that  address in postal address lists that we sell or rent to third  parties. If you would like us to stop including your postal address  in such lists, please send us a letter (which should be addressed to  Meredith Corporation, Opt-Out Postal, Attn: Circulation, 1716 Locust  Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309), requesting that we remove your  postal address from these lists. If we receive such a letter from  you, we will act as promptly as possible to remove your postal  address from future postal address lists that we sell or rent to  third parties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p style="margin:0 0 0 20px;"><strong>Other  Disclosures.</strong> We may occasionally release information about our visitors when  release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our <u><a href="http://www.betterrecipes.com/visitoragreement">Visitor  Agreement</a></u>,  or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our  sites, the public, or Meredith Corporation. As our business grows, we  may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Meredith  Corporation, substantially all of our assets, or one or more of our  sites (or substantially all of its assets) is acquired by another  company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred  assets. </p> <p style="text-align:right;"><a href="#">Return to top</a></p>

					<h6><a name="5" id="5">5. Newsletters  and Promotions:</a></h6>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				    <p style="margin:0 0 0 10px;"><strong>Newsletters.</strong> We may offer you the opportunity to subscribe to email newsletters on  various topics that we believe are of interest to our visitors. If  you have opted to receive a particular newsletter, you can always  unsubscribe later either (1) by following the 'unsubscribe' link  located near the bottom of each newsletter, or (2) by going to <a href="https://secure.recipes.betterrecipes.com/common/myaccount/">My  Account</a> , selecting "Unsubscribe" from the Newsletter options,  unchecking the relevant boxes and pressing the "Update"  button.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				    <p style="margin:0 0 0 10px;"><strong>Promotional  Emails.</strong> If you provide us with your email address, from time to time we may  send you emails about Meredith products, services and special offers  (such as special Meredith magazine subscription offers) that we  believe may be of interest to you. When you register, you will also  be given an opportunity to tell us whether you would like to receive  emails about products, services and special offers from third-party  providers. Though we hope that you will find both types of  promotional emails helpful, if you decide that you no longer wish to  receive either or both types of emails, please go to the <a href="https://secure.recipes.betterrecipes.com/common/profile/member/optout%20">Email  Preferences</a> page and update your preferences. Of course, you may change your  preferences at any time. We will make any changes you request as  quickly as we can.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p style="margin:0 0 0 10px;">The  personally identifying information we collect is stored within a  database that we control. We use standard, industry-wide procedures  such as firewalls and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to  protect your information. However, as effective as encryption  technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot  guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that  information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted  to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include  in a message you post to any message board, discussion group, or  other public posting area on our sites is available to anyone with  Internet access. If you don't want people to know your name or email  address, for example, make sure not to include it in any message you  post publicly. Please see our <a href="http://www.betterrecipes.com/visitoragreement">Visitor  Agreement</a> for more information related to posting materials on our sites,  including our use of such materials.</p>

					<h6>YOUR  CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h6>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				    <p><strong>(As  provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</strong></p>			<p>&nbsp;</p>
				    <p>Under  California Civil Code Section 1798.83 – also known as the “Shine  the Light” law – California residents have a right to request  certain information from each business they patronize regarding that  business’s disclosures of personal information to third parties for  the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Generally, if a  business has disclosed personal information regarding its California  customers to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the  preceding calendar year, the business is required to provide, upon  request and free of charge, a list of the names and addresses of all  such third parties, together with a list of the categories of  personal information that was disclosed.</p>
				   <p>&nbsp;</p>
				   
				   <p>The  “Shine The Light” law creates an exception for businesses that  adopt and disclose to the public (in their privacy policies) a policy  of not sharing personal information for direct marketing purposes  without offering their customers choices to prevent such disclosures.  These businesses are not obligated to provide the lists described  above and may respond to requests from California customers by  notifying them of their rights to prevent disclosures of personal  information for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost-free  means of exercising those rights. </p>
