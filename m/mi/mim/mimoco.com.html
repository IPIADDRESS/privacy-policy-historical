      we handle your personal information. We hope this brief statement will clearly 
      describe how we make use of your information when you sign up for mimoco 
      news alerts or purchase goods on the mimoco website.<br><br>
      The security of your information is important to us and your details are 
      kept safe behind secure networks. We employ other companies to perform credit 
      card processing on our behalf. These agents have access to personal information 
      needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
      We promise not to sell or disclose your email or any personal information 
      to any other third party without your consent.<br><br>
      mimoco does not buy, rent, or sell email addresses. Every email sent includes 
      directions to unsubscribe, allowing users to immediately remove themselves 
      from subscription. The only way to receive email news alerts is to subscribe.<br><br>
