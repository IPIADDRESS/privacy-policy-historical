            <p align="left">With respect to using your credit card to conduct 
              transactions through the Services, the credit card issuer's policy 
              regarding unauthorized use will determine what (if any) limits there 
              are on your liability. If you feel that you have been a victim of 
              unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit 
              card provider in accordance with its own reporting rules and procedures. 
              If you feel that your situation has not been resolved satisfactorily, 
              please contact us at privacy@mimeo.com and we will use reasonable 
              efforts to assist you. Please note that you are responsible for 
              maintaining the confidentiality of your Mimeo.com password, and 
              are responsible for any and all activities, including but not limited

            <p align="left" class="subText336699Bold">Measures We Take to Help 
              Ensure the Safety of Your Transactions</p>
            <p align="left">Mimeo.com uses an industry-standard security technology 
              called Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL"), a protocol developed by Netscape 
              for the secure transmission of private information over the Internet. 
              SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that are transmitted 
              over the SSL connection. Current versions of the Netscape Navigator, 
              Internet Explorer and America Online browsers support SSL, as do 
              other browsers, and Mimeo.com's Web site uses SSL when its customers 
              transmit confidential information, such as credit card numbers. 
              Your document is uploaded to us using the same encryption settings 
              your browser uses when connecting to our site. Web pages that require 
              an SSL connection generally start with "https" instead of "http, 
              although some pages and frames within pages may be encrypted even 
              without the https address. Your browser's help files can show you 
              how to verify whether a particular page utilizes SSL. For more information 
              on SSL, please visit the Netscape Web site at http://home.netscape.com/security/techbriefs/ssl.html. 
            </p>
            <p align="left">Every time you place an order, we will send you confirmation 
              regarding your order status using the e-mail address provided to 
              us by you. You will know exactly when we have received your order, 
              when the printing job is completed and even when we submit your 
              documents to Federal Express for shipping. Once your order has been 
              submitted to Federal Express, all delivery service and tracking 
              information is provided by Federal Express. </p>
            <p align="left">While Mimeo.com encourages all third parties involved

              the Information We Gather </p>
            <p align="left">In order to use the Services, each Customer is required 
              to provide us with an email address and a unique password. In addition, 
              when placing an order with Mimeo.com, each Customer is required 
              to provide us with personally identifying and other information 
              such as the Customer's name, phone number, address, payment information 
              (including credit card information), and shipping information (such 
              as third party shipping addresses and shipping preferences). Mimeo.com 
              also collects non-personally identifiable information such as aggregate 
              use statistics. We collect such non-personally identifiable information 
              in part through the use of "cookies" that is, small text files placed

            <p align="left">The Services are neither directed toward children 
              (under thirteen years of age), nor is it made available to children. 
              We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information 
              or accept orders from children. </p>
            <p align="left" class="subText336699Bold">How We Use, and Do Not Use, 
              the Information We Gather</p>
            <p align="left">Please take some time to familiarize yourself with 
              the different ways Mimeo.com uses the information that it gathers. 
              Keep in mind that, while Mimeo.com encourages all third parties 
              involved including but not limited to its affiliates and advertisers 
              to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors 
              and Customers and to otherwise handle personal information in a 
              responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility 
              for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner 
              in which they use information received either from Mimeo.com or 
              independently. Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third 
              party associated with, or who claims association with Mimeo.com, 
              whom you feel is improperly collecting or using information about 
              you, please contact privacy@mimeo.com; we will use reasonable efforts 
              to help you address the situation. </p>
            <p align="left" class="subText336699Bold">(a) How we use (and do not 
              use) non-personally identifiable information </p>
            <p align="left">We use non-personally identifiable information in 
              aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by 
              performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics 
              and behavior of our Customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics 
              and interests regarding specific areas of the Mimeo.com web site. 
              We may provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers, 
              affiliates, and other current and potential business partners. </p>
            <p align="left">The Mimeo.com web site may contain links to other 
              Internet web sites, including co branded or other affiliated sites 
              which may or may not be owned or operated by Mimeo.com. Unless otherwise 
              explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy practices 
              or the content of such web sites, including such sites' use of any 
              information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system) 
              collected when visitors to the Mimeo.com web site click through 
              links to those sites. Even though such information might not identify 
              you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with 
              the privacy practices of those sites. </p>
            <p align="left" class="subText336699Bold">(b) How we use (and do not 
              use) personally identifiable information </p>
            <p align="left">Mimeo.com provides notice to potential customers that 
              personally identifiable information will be collected when a Customer 
              places an order in order to process such order; moreover, this Security 
              and Privacy Policy itself serves as notice that such information 
              is collected under those circumstances. </p>
            <p align="left">You may choose to "opt in" to receiving promotional 
              materials not directly related to our services from Mimeo.com and/or 
              its affiliates, advertisers, or other business partners. If you 
              "opt in" to receiving such promotional materials, Mimeo.com reserves 
              the right to release any personally identifiable registration information 
              regarding you to third parties who provide goods or services that 
              we believe may be of interest to you. Note, however, that we are 
              not responsible for the actions of such third parties. </p>
            <p align="left">Mimeo.com believes that all emails it sends to you 
              after you sign up for an account are designed to help you best use 
              the Services. The solicitations are limited in that they, among 
              other things, will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail 
              and provide the customer with a method of "opting out" of receiving 
              future communications of a similar nature. </p>
            <p align="left">PLEASE NOTE that despite the disclosure limitation 
              above, Mimeo.com reserves the right to disclose information or documents 
              concerning or submitted by any Customer as we reasonably feel is 
              necessary to protect our systems or business, including but not 
              limited to complying with judicial order or law enforcement officials. 
              Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose 
              such information or documents when a visitor or Customer is in violation 
              of our Terms and Conditions or other published guidelines, or partakes 
              (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any infringing or illegal 
              activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, 
              and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental 
              orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required 
              by law, as well as in response to allegations of infringement or 
              illegality. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying 
              those who may be using our servers or services for illegal activities. 
              We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity 
              to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend 
              or terminate your membership in connection with any suspected illegal 
              or infringing activity. </p>
            <p align="left" class="subText336699Bold">Surveys and Sweepstakes 
            </p>
            <p align="left">Occasionally, Mimeo.com may conduct surveys in order 
              to better deliver advertisements and content and to better understand 
              your needs relating to the Services. We will not share your survey 
              information with any third party, except in aggregate form. In addition, 
              if and when we sponsor sweepstakes or other promotions, or third 
              parties sponsor such promotions in conjunction with us, either we 
              or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the 
              official rules and/or registration area for the sweepstakes or promotion. 
              That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Policy, 
              will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes so please remember 
              to read it carefully. </p>

              Information </p>
            <p align="left">If you would like to change your personally identifiable 
              information in Mimeo.com's databases, you may do so through the 
              Services themselves, or by contacting us at customerservice@mimeo.com, 
              and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. 
              Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that 
              will remain within Mimeo.com databases, access logs, and other records, 
              which may or may not contain inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable 
              information. The residual information will not be used for commercial 
              purposes; however Mimeo.com reserves the right, from time to time, 
              to re-contact former users of the Services. </p>
