		We at Mimeo.com are committed to protecting the security and privacy of your personal information.  Your loyalty as a Customer is important, and we hope that our dedication to the security and privacy of your transactions and information, as described in this policy (the "Security and Privacy Policy" or "Policy"), demonstrates our commitment to making your Mimeo.com experience a good one.
</p><p>
Note that, by using Mimeo.com's web site (currently located at http://www.mimeo.com and http://www.gomimeo.com) and the related services provided by Mimeo.com or its designees (the "Services"), you signify your agreement to this Policy.  In order to keep pace with legal and industry developments, Mimeo.com reviews its security and privacy practices from time to time; therefore, our security privacy practices are subject to change.  If Mimeo.com changes any of its security or privacy policies, the changes will be posted here, in this document, so that you can always determine our current security policies, what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.  We reserve the right, at our discretion to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Policy at any time.  Please be sure to check this page each time prior to using the Services.
</p><p>
If you have any questions regarding this Security and Privacy Policy, the Service, or Mimeo.com, please email us at 
<a href="mailto:privacy@mimeo.com">privacy@mimeo.com</a>.<br><br></p><br>&nbsp;

<b>1. Our Security Policy</b><br>
With respect to using your credit card to conduct transactions through the Services, the credit card issuer's policy regarding unauthorized use will determine what (if any) limits there are on your liability.  If you feel that you have been a victim of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its own reporting rules and procedures.  If you feel that your situation has not been resolved satisfactorily, please contact us at  <a href="mailto:privacy@mimeo.com">privacy@mimeo.com</a> and we will use reasonable efforts to assist you.  Please note that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Mimeo.com password, and are responsible for any and all activities, including but not limited to all orders (whether or not such orders were authorized by you), that are made through your Mimeo.com account.
<p>
<b>Measures We Take to Help Ensure the Safety of Your Transactions</b>
</p><p>
Mimeo.com uses an industry-standard security technology called Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL"), a protocol developed by Netscape for the secure transmission of private information over the Internet.  SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that are transmitted over the SSL connection.  Current versions of the Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer and America Online browsers support SSL, as do other browsers, and Mimeo.com's Web site uses SSL when its customers transmit confidential information, such as credit card numbers.  Your document is uploaded to us using the same encryption settings your browser uses when connecting to our site.  Web pages that require an SSL connection generally start with "https" instead of "http, although some pages and frames within pages may be encrypted even without the https address.  Your browser's help files can show you how to verify whether a particular page utilizes SSL.  For more information on SSL, please visit the <a href="http://developer.netscape.com/tech/security/ssl/howitworks.html">Netscape Web site</a> at http://home.netscape.com/security/techbriefs/ssl.html.
</p><p>
Every time you place an order, we will send you confirmation regarding your order status using the e-mail address provided to us by you. You will know exactly when we have received your order, when the printing job is completed and even when we submit your documents to Federal Express for shipping.  Once your order has been submitted to Federal Express, all delivery service and tracking information is provided by Federal Express.
</p><p>
While Mimeo.com encourages all third parties involved to conform to our security practices, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties with respect to security.</p>

<b>2. Our Privacy Policy on the Information We Gather </b><br>In order to use the Services, each Customer is required to provide us with an email address and a unique password.  In addition, when placing an order with Mimeo.com, each Customer is required to provide us with personally identifying and other information such as the Customer's name, phone number, address, payment information (including credit card information), and shipping information (such as third party shipping addresses and shipping preferences).  Mimeo.com also collects non-personally identifiable information such as aggregate use statistics. We collect such non-personally identifiable information in part through the use of "cookies" that is, small text files placed on your computer's hard drive.
<p>
The Services are neither directed toward children (under thirteen years of age), nor is it made available to children. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information or accept orders from children.
</p><p>
<b>How we use (and do not use) the information we gather.</b> <br>
Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways Mimeo.com uses the information that it gathers.  Keep in mind that, while Mimeo.com encourages all third parties involved including but not limited to its affiliates and advertisers to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and Customers and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from Mimeo.com or independently.  Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association with Mimeo.com, whom you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@mimeo.com">privacy@mimeo.com</a>; we will use reasonable efforts to help you address the situation.
</p><p>
(a) <b>How we use (and do not use) non-personally identifiable information&nbsp;</b>
<br>We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our Customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Mimeo.com web site. We may provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers, affiliates, and other current and potential business partners.</p>

<p>The Mimeo.com web site may contain links to other Internet web sites, including co branded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by Mimeo.com.  Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, including such sites' use of any information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors to the Mimeo.com web site click through links to those sites.  Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those sites.

</p><p>(b) <b>How we use (and do not use)  personally identifiable information</b>&nbsp;
<br>Mimeo.com provides notice to potential customers that personally identifiable information will be collected when a Customer places an order in order to process such order; moreover, this Security and Privacy Policy itself serves as notice that such information is collected under those circumstances.  

</p><p>You may choose to "opt in" to receiving promotional materials not directly related to our services from Mimeo.com and/or its affiliates, advertisers, or other business partners.  If you "opt in" to receiving such promotional materials, Mimeo.com reserves the right to release any personally identifiable registration information regarding you to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you. Note, however, that we are not responsible for the actions of such third parties.

</p><p>Mimeo.com believes that all emails it sends to you after you sign up for an account are designed to help you best use the Services.  The solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and provide the customer with a method of "opting out" of receiving future communications of a similar nature.  

</p><p>PLEASE NOTE that despite the disclosure limitation above, Mimeo.com reserves the right to disclose information or documents concerning or submitted by any Customer as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business, including but not limited to complying with judicial order or law enforcement officials.  Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information or documents when a visitor or Customer is in violation of our Terms and Conditions or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any infringing or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law, as well as in response to allegations of infringement or illegality.  We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your membership in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity.

</p><p><b>Surveys and Sweepstakes</b>
<br>Occasionally, Mimeo.com may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content and to better understand your needs relating to the Services.  We will not share your survey information with any third party, except in aggregate form.  In addition, if and when we sponsor sweepstakes or other promotions, or third parties sponsor such promotions in conjunction with us, either we or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the sweepstakes or promotion.  That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes so please remember to read it carefully.
