Thank you for visiting the University of Miami website. Your privacy is very important to us. Simply stated, our policy is to collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit our website unless you&nbsp;actively choose to make such information available to us. This Privacy Statement generally describes how we collect, use and/or share information gathered by our websites.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="we_collect"></a>Information We Collect<br></font></b>When visiting our websites, some information is collected electronically or by technology. For example, when accessing the Internet, each computer is assigned a unique identifier called an IP address that identifies where information is coming from or where information should be sent. Along with your IP address, we collect information regarding which pages you visit on our site, from which page you came to our site, and the software you use to visit our site and its configuration. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. When you use any shopping cart functions that may be included on our websites, your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. None of that information is associated with you as an individual.</p>
<p>Our websites also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. A cookie is a collection of information stored on your computer that usually includes a username and the current date and time or other user specific information that helps us tailor our websites to your interests. Your web browser (Netscape, Explorer, etc) allows you to be warned when cookies are being placed on your computer or to refuse all cookies. However, not accepting or disabling cookies from our websites may prevent you from accessing certain parts of our websites.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="you_provide"></a>Information You Provide</font></b><br>In addition to information collected by technology, some parts of our websites may ask you to provide personal information. You will know when you are sharing personal information with us because you will need to send a message, fill out a form or application or answer questions, and then agree to provide this information to us. If you choose to share personal information with us, we will use the information only for the purposes you have authorized.</p>
<p>Our site uses online surveys to ask you for information and/or forms for you to request information, products, and services. These online surveys or forms may ask you to provide personal information like contact information (e.g., home or e-mail addresses or phone numbers), unique identifiers (e.g., UM IDs, Social Security numbers), and financial information (e.g., account or credit card numbers). Contact information from these forms is used to respond to requests for information, send orders to you, or to contact you when necessary or requested. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the Choice/Opt-out section below). Financial information that is collected is used to bill you for products and services you have requested. Unique identifiers (such as Social Security numbers) are collected from Web site visitors to verify your identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.</p>
<p>Some of the information we collect or that you provide may be saved for a designated or indefinite period of time, but we will not disclose the information to third parties or government agencies, unless required to do so by state or federal law, in support of University sponsored programs or activities, or to protect the integrity, safety, and security of our websites (see below for information about how to update or remove your information).</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="children"></a>Children's Guidelines</font></b><br>The University of Miami does not knowingly collect online contact information from children under 13 years of age without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and/or participation in the activity. In the absence of prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request. Such information will not be used for other purposes without prior parental consent. We do not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information with out prior parental consent. We do not give the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent. We do not offer special games, prizes or other activities, to entice users to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity.
