<h3><a name="types">TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED</a></h3>

<p>The following are the types of information we may collect:</p>

<p>Information You Provide Us:  In the course of using the website, we may ask you to provide us with certain information, including contact information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, or fax number; unique identifiers, such as your user ID and user password; demographic information, 
such as your date of birth, age, gender, education, household income, occupation, ticket holder status, financial information; or similar information. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. The Miami Dolphins do not store this information and it is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time.</p> 

<p>Site Usage Information: We may receive and store certain types of internet usage information whenever you visit the Website, such as your click-stream data and your IP address. See the "IP Addresses and Click Stream Data" section below.</p>

<p>Email Communications: When you open emails from us, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from our subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, we keep a record of what communications you have opted to receive or not to receive.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="" width="100%"><br>

<h3><a name="how">HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED</a></h3>

<p>We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:</p>

<p>Registration: You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Website may choose to offer, such as newsletters or contests. Participation in registration is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.</p>

<p>Newsletters and Website Emails: We offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Website, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our marketing partners and advertisers and sponsors.  You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Website. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. You may also cancel your free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Website or in the newsletter or email to <a href="mailto:dolphins@miamidolphins.com">dolphins@miamidolphins.com</a>.</p>

<p>Contests or Sweepstakes: We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Website that may require registration or the submission of personal information.  Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes, (see the rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be used).  We may also ask your permission to allow us to publicly post some of your information on the Website, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Website, and collect your information.  In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we do not collect your information and we have no control over the information collected from you.  Accordingly, we urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.</p>  

<p>Surveys or Voting: From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from you in conjunction with a survey or voting poll. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.</p>  

<p>Games: When you register to play games on our Website, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Cookies: As with many Websites, our Website uses a technology called "cookies."  A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the 
Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let us know how many people visit our website and where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being used to access the website. For registered users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences.  By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. Cookies are not tied to personal information on MiamiDolphins.com.</p>

<p>IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data: We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal 
information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, 
what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.</p>

<p>Transaction Information: Transactions on MiamiDolphins.com are limited to either offline methods (i.e. Dol-Fan Club memberships, etc.) or through a 3rd party site (team pro shop, ticketmaster, etc.).</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="" width="100%"><br>

<h3><a name="use">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</a></h3>

<p>As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used to:</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="" width="100%"><br>

<h3><a name="shared">WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED</a></h3>

<p>At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes.  The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your information shared:</p>

<p>Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit 
card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products. These third parties include our <a href="http://www.miamidolphinsproshop.com/">team online store </a>(http://www.miamidolphinsproshop.com/), <a href="http://dolphins.ed4.net/profile/index.cfm/dolphins/signup.html">e-newsletter</a> (http://dolphins.ed4.net/profile/index.cfm/dolphins/signup.html) and <a href="http://www.onlineinsights.com/dolphins/">fan survey</a> (http://www.onlineinsights.com/dolphins/). Please note that you are submitting your information directly to these third party sites even though these pages have the look and feel of our team site. This privacy policy governs the e-newsletter site. The privacy policies of the online store and fan survey apply to their pages.</p>

<p>Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Other Promotional Offers:  We may send offers to you on 
behalf of our marketing partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not 
want to receive such offers, you may contact us. This can be done by using an opt out message in an email, or by 
emailing us at <a href="mailto:dolphins@miamidolphins.com">dolphins@miamidolphins.com</a>. You can expect a response to your request within 10-20 business days.</p>

<p>Business Transfers:  In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your personally idententifiable information is one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer. See "YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THE POLICY" section below.</p>

<p>Administrative or Legal Process:  Your personal information may be transferred to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, law enforcement agencies, to protect our rights, or protect the rights of other users of this website.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="" width="100%"><br>

<h3><a name="security">SECURITY</a></h3>

<p>This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="" width="100%"><br>

<h3><a name="links">LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</a></h3>

<p>You should be aware that when you are on the Website you could be directed to other Websites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Website onto a different Website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that Website's privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="" width="100%"><br>

<h3><a name="#parents">A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS CONCERNING PRIVACY</a></h3>

<p>The Website is a general audience Website. We do not currently collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen on the Website. If in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children, it will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) including, without limitation, obtaining necessary parental consent.</p>

<h3><a name="#changes">YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THE POLICY</a></h3>

<p>By using this Website, you signify your agreement to the terms of our privacy policy.  We may amend this privacy policy at any time.  If we make a material 
change to the way in which we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will post a notice on our website and / or send an email to users who have provided an email address.  We will assume that you have given your permission for your information to be used under the terms of the new privacy policy,

<hr size="1" noshade="" width="100%"><br>

<h3><a name="correcting">CORRECTING/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</a></h3>

<p>If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your email address or zip code), or if you no longer desire to access our Website, we will 
endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you have provided to us. This can be done by using an opt out message in an email, or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:dolphins@miamidolphins.com">dolphins@miamidolphins.com</a>.

<hr size="1" noshade="" width="100%"><br>

<h3><a name="california">YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</a></h3>

<p>A California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005, allows California residents to obtain specific information about a business's privacy practices if it shares information with other companies for those companies' direct marketing purposes.</p>  

<p>As explained in this privacy policy, whenever you agree to let us collect personal information about you, we will always provide you with an option to prevent this information from being shared for non-administrative purposes with third parties.
