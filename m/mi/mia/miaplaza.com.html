We sometimes release alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome user feedback on any privacy concerns you may have.

Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile settings, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.</p>  <p><strong>mia</strong>plaza uses what is called a "session" cookie, which identifies a particular visit to the <strong>mia</strong>plaza site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>  <p>In addition, if you enable the automatic login feature, a "persistent" cookie stays on your computer between sessions to allow <strong>mia</strong>plaza to recognize your user account the next time you visit.
