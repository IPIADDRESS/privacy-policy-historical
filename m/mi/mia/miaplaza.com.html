				Privacy Policy
			</h2><p>Your privacy is our top concern. We work hard to earn and keep your trust, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy: </p>  <ul>  <li>We will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes   </li><li>We will not share your contact information with another user unless both of you choose to contact one another and/or otherwise provide such contact information to each other   </li><li>We recognize the importance of privacy and use reasonable efforts to secure your information for unauthorized disclosure </li></ul>  <p>We will use reasonable efforts to comply with these privacy principles and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with them. We sometimes release alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome user feedback on any privacy concerns you may have. In light of the above and because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, <strong>mia</strong>plaza does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. <strong>mia</strong>plaza shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this privacy policy.</p>  <p>Please read this privacy policy to learn more about:</p>  <ol>  <li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected by <strong>mia</strong>plaza.   </li><li>The use of cookies and log files.   </li><li>The prohibition on children’s use of the site.   </li><li>How the information is used.   </li><li>With whom the information may be shared.   </li><li>How you can access and change your Account information.   </li><li>What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information collected by <strong>mia</strong>plaza.   </li><li>How to contact us. </li></ol>  <p><strong>mia</strong>plaza enables members to more effectively link to families and friends, as well as to serve in their communities. <strong>mia</strong>plaza is a commercial enterprise that collects or may in the future collect revenues through advertising, permission-based referrals to other sites or services, and upgrades to premium member services.</p>  <p>Please note that his privacy policy is provided under, and subject to, the <strong>mia</strong>plaza User Agreement.</p>  <p><strong>Effective Date: </strong>This policy was last updated on 8/9/2007. </p>  <p><strong>mia</strong>plaza enables members to more effectively link to families and friends, as well as to serve their communities. <strong>mia</strong>plaza is a commercial enterprise that collects or may in the future collect revenues through advertising, commissions for sales through affiliate programs such as through Amazon.com, and upgrades to premium member services.</p>  <p><strong>Information Collection</strong></p>  <p><em>Registration: </em></p>  <p>In order to become a <strong>mia</strong>plaza user, you must first create an account on this web site. To create an account you are required to provide the following information: name, email address, country, ZIP/postal code, and you must choose a password and a preferred language.</p>  <p>You may also provide information on your postal address, phone numbers, website URL, and birthdate. This information can be made available to your Direct Contacts, at your discretion, but will not be available for others.</p>  <p>You may provide additional information about yourself in the Interests section, and you can specify that this be made available to other members at <strong>mia</strong>plaza. You may also submit a picture and make this available to other members at <strong>mia</strong>plaza.</p>  <p><em>Information about your Contacts: </em></p>  <p>In order to invite others to connect with you directly in <strong>mia</strong>plaza, you will enter their names and email addresses. This information will be used by <strong>mia</strong>plaza to send your invitation including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send the one invitation and any reminders you ask us to send either at the time of the first invitation or later; they will not be used by <strong>mia</strong>plaza to contact them for any other reason. Should the person you invite wish that their email information be removed from miaplaza files, the person wishing their information removed can contact us at any time. </p>  <p><strong>Cookies &amp; Log Files</strong></p>  <p>Like most web sites, <strong>mia</strong>plaza uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows <strong>mia</strong>plaza to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile settings, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.</p>  <p><strong>mia</strong>plaza uses what is called a "session" cookie, which identifies a particular visit to the <strong>mia</strong>plaza site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>  <p>In addition, if you enable the automatic login feature, a "persistent" cookie stays on your computer between sessions to allow <strong>mia</strong>plaza to recognize your user account the next time you visit. This cookie is removed if you turn off this automatic login or if you switch users. At this time <strong>mia</strong>plaza does not use other "persistent" cookies.</p>  <p>Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the <strong>mia</strong>plaza web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave <strong>mia</strong>plaza. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the <strong>mia</strong>plaza service, but is not linked to personally identifiable information in any way.</p>  <p><strong>Children</strong></p>  <p>Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service.</p>  <p><strong>Information Use</strong></p>  <p>The information you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe yourself to other users. In addition, <strong>mia</strong>plaza collects certain types of information in order to operate and improve our service to you and other users. For example, we use third party tools to gather aggregate data on how many visit what <strong>mia</strong>plaza pages, what paths are taken by members to get to <strong>mia</strong>plaza, which browsers are used most, and other statistics. <strong>mia</strong>plaza, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.</p>  <p>We transfer Information and Personally Identifiable Information outside of Europe to the United States. By visiting our Web site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in this policy. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction, which may have less stringent privacy practices than your own. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data.</p>  <p><strong><em>mia</em>plaza Communications</strong></p>  <p><strong>mia</strong>plaza will communicate with you through email and notices posted on this website. These includes occasional emails to inform you about various features of the service. Please note that you can opt out of any or all types emails from <strong>mia</strong>plaza by changing preferences on your Manage Communications Settings page, which you can get to using the link provided on the bottom of each email (login is required). If you have difficulties changing these settings, please contact us.</p>  <p><strong>Customized Content</strong></p>  <p>Information you provide at registration or in your Account Management section is also used to customize your experience on the web site. For example, the language used for many menu items is changed according to the setting on your Account Management page.</p>  <p><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>  <p><em>Sharing Information with Third Parties: </em></p>  <p><strong>mia</strong>plaza takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. For instance, we use a payment and credit card processing company to bill users for subscription fees. We also use third party software development firms and server hosting services. None of these third parties retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.</p>  <p><em>Communications between Users: </em></p>  <p>Emails you initiate will never list personal information about you apart from what your write for that email specifically, nor will it specify the people to whom you are directly connected unless you have added this information. Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish a direct link as a “<strong>mia</strong>plaza friend” and you set preferences to allow sharing of your contact information. You can end a direct link to a miaplaza friend using the Friends Management section of<strong></strong>the site. You can also restrict who sees your profile information, element by element, using the Profile section of <strong>mia</strong>plaza.</p>  <p><em>Legal Disclaimer: </em></p>  <p>It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>  <p><strong>Information Safeguards </strong></p>  <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
