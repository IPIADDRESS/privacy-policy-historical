<b>Introduction</b><br>

<br>
The Mizuno USA Privacy Policy details our commitment to protect your information and the limited manner in which we will use that information to provide and improve our provision of the Services. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy</b><br>
Throughout the Mizuno USA Privacy Policy we use several specialized terms.  “Personally Identifiable Information” is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, email address, billing address, credit card number and expiration date.  “User Information” means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in the Mizuno USA Privacy Policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user’s computer.  We use the term “aggregate” when we combine information from various persons or users.   Information is said to be “anonymized” if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.<br>
  <br>
<br>
<b>Information We Collect and How We Use It</b><br>

We will only collect and store the domain name and host from which a user accessed the Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of the user’s computer, the user’s browser software and operating system, the date and time the user accesses the site and the Internet address of any Web site from which the user linked directly to our site or to which the user links after visiting our site.  We use this information to measure the number of visitors to sections of our sites, to determine from where our visitors linked and to where our visitors link from the sites and to help us make our sites more useful.  For example, we organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide efficient service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics.  This type of information is sometimes shared with third parties, such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing and commercial purposes.  When we share such information with third parties we will require them to abide by the standards of the Mizuno USA Privacy Policy.  Mizuno USA is the sole owner of the information collected on this Site.  <b> We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from that disclosed in this Privacy Policy.</b><br>
