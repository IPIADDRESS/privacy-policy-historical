						WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY EFFECTIVE DATE: February 6, 2009</p>

						<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
						<p>1.1. PURPOSE OF POLICY. Mindflash Technologies, Inc. ("us," "we," or "Company") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company Website (the "Site"). We created this Website Privacy Policy (this "Policy") to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other Websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy. </p>

						<p>1.2. NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN </p>

						<p>PLEASE NOTE: We are a general audience site, and do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children's privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information in that user's account. </p>

						<p>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES </p>

						<p>2.1. WHAT BASIC INFORMATION DOES THE COMPANY COLLECT? </p>

						<p>In operating the Site, Company may include registration, online surveys, and other online forms that ask users to provide their names, e-mail addresses, and other contact information. </p>

						<p>2.2. WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT? </p>

						<p>(a) AUTOMATIC COLLECTION. Our servers automatically recognize visitors' domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). No personal information about you is revealed in this process. The Site may also gather anonymous "traffic data" that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. </p>

						<p>(b) COOKIES. From time to time, we may use the standard "cookies" feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Website. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies, nor do we employ any data capture mechanisms on our Website other than cookies. Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need improvement. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at our Website may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended. </p>

						<p>3. USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION </p>

						<p>(a) PERSONAL INFORMATION. We will not share your personal information with any third parties without your consent, except as necessary to provide you with the services offered by us or to comply with the law. We may use your personal information and share it with third parties to verify your identity, to check your qualifications, or to follow up with transactions initiated on the Site, including, but not limited to processing your credit card payment, if applicable. We may also use your contact information to inform you of any changes to the Site, or to send you additional information about Company. If you give your permission during the account registration process, we may share your contact information with our business partners or other companies so that they may send you promotional materials. </p>

						<p>(b) ANONYMOUS INFORMATION. We use anonymous information to analyze our Site traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. In addition, we may use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and transaction information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis. </p>

						<p>(c) USE OF COOKIES. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, or for other purposes. </p>

						<p>(d) DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Company or its parent company, subsidiaries or affiliates, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Company or the users of the Site, or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Site. </p>

						<p>(e) SALE OF INFORMATION. In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets, including the information collected through this Website. If Company or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer. </p>

						<p>(f) ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Unfortunately, we do not maintain any procedures for you to review or request changes to some of the information that we collect about you.
