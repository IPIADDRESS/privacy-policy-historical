Privacy Policy</h2> <p class="lead">EFFECTIVE DATE: January 20, 2017</p> <p>We at Mindflash Technologies, Inc. (“Mindflash”, “we”, “us” or “our”) know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you use or otherwise engage with our websites and software services (collectively, the “Service”), but it does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not manage. This Privacy Policy describes what types of personally identifiable information we collect, how we use that information, and who we share that information with. By using or accessing the Service in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information as set forth below</p> <p>You understand that your Service account is provisioned under an agreement that Mindflash has with your employer (or, if you are not an employee, with the entity that you provide consulting services to) (such entity, your “Employer” and such agreement, an “Employer Agreement”). The Employer Agreement contains obligations and restrictions regarding your use of the Service that your Employer is required to ensure you comply with. Your use of the Service is conditioned on the Employer Agreement, and you may lose access to the Service at any time should the Employer Agreement terminate. <strong>Further, you understand that your Employer may access any information that we collect from or about you through the Service. We do not control what your Employer does with such information.</strong></p> <p><strong>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</strong></p> <p>We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. </p> <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@mindflash.com">help@mindflash.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>WILL THIS PRIVACY POLICY EVER CHANGE?</strong></p> <p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the mindflash.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p> <p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DOES MINDFLASH COLLECT?</strong></p> <p><i>Information You Provide to Us:</i></p> <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your single sign-on (SSO) login credentials for Yammer). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, your SSO credentials may be transferred to us.</p> <p>Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. If you do not provide us with such information, your access to or use of the Service may be limited. Additionally, from time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in email surveys or provide user testimonials through the Service. In either case, we will request certain personal information from you which may include contact phone number and address. Participation in surveys and providing testimonials is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.</p> <p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, then please follow the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or by accessing the email preferences in your account settings page, or you can contact us at <a href="mailto:help@mindflash.com">help@mindflash.com</a>.</p> <p><i>Information Collected Automatically</i></p> <p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p> <p>Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p> <p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p> <p><strong>WILL MINDFLASH SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</strong></p> <p>Except as expressly provided below, We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p> <p><strong>Information that’s been de-identified:</strong> We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p> <p><strong>Advertisers:</strong> We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.</p> <p><strong>Affiliated Businesses:</strong> In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p> <p><strong>Agents:</strong> We use third-party providers (such as contractors) to perform some tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use Amazon Web Services to host your content or data. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Note that an “agent” may also be considered a “partner” in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the terms of the “Information that’s been de-identified” section in that regard.</p> <p><strong>User Profiles and Submissions:</strong> Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services. Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) and any testimonials you provide to us becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. </p> <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p> <p><strong>Protection of Mindflash and Others:</strong> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply the terms of any agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Mindflash, our employees, our users, or others.</p> <p><strong>IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</strong></p> <p>Mindflash has implemented and maintains administrative, technical and physical security measures (including data encryption measures) to help prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, theft, misuse, destruction and alteration of your Personal Information, but we cannot guarantee that such measures will prevent any unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, theft, misuse, destruction or alteration of your Personal Information. Mindflash will notify you of any suspected or confirmed unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, theft, misuse, destruction or alteration of your Personal Information to the extent required by and in accordance with applicable state and federal law.</p> <p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p> <p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p> <p><strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?</strong></p> <p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit the following information you’ve provided to us:<br> </p><ul> <li>password</li> <li>email address</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions about viewing, updating, or deleting information we have on file about you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@mindflash.com">help@mindflash.com</a>. We will make reasonable efforts to provide you with access or correct such information if it is inaccurate or delete such information if we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.
