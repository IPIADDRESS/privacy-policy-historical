This privacy policy also applies to all of the data that we collect through our Services, irrespective of the type of Services or the device and platforms you use to access the Services. By using and accessing the Sites and Services, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy, and you are consenting to our processing of your information as described below.</p> <br><h3>Information we collect</h3> <p>When you visit our Sites or use our Services, we collect personal data. The information we collect about you depends on the services that you use (and how you use them):</p> <p><b>Information you provide to us directly:</b> When you sign up for or use our Services, we ask you to provide your name, email address, the type of company you work for, and password. We may collect payment information from you in order to take payment for our Services. If you contact our support, we will collect the information we need to categorize your question and respond to it.</p> <p><b>Information we collect automatically:</b> We collect information about you automatically when you visit our Sites or use our Services. For example, we collect information about how often you use the Services, pages visited, links clicked, mouse movements, and other information about how you interact with the Sites and Services. We may also collect data about how you interact with messages we send to you, for example, whether you opened an email or read an in-app message. We collect information about the device you use to access our Sites and Services, including your browser, operating system, and cookie information.

You may choose not to provide this information, but you need to understand that in some circumstances this may mean we are unable to provide you with a certain service or product. Any personal information provided by you as a user of the Services will be used only as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> <br><h4>Cookies</h4> <p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to store your preferences, and to improve you access to and use of the Site. Cookies are required to use the Site, turning off cookies would mean not being able to login into the system.</p> <br><h4>Click Analytics</h4> <p>Minter.io allow users to create trackable minter.ly links to analyze clicks, for example to understand how, when and where minter.ly links are clicked. We collect aggregated, anonymous statistics about accesses (such as clicks) of every minter.ly link created through the Services, including general location of the devices accessing the minter.ly link, referring websites or services, time and date of each access.</p> <br><h3>Using your personal information</h3> <p>We use, process, and store your personal information as necessary to provide you with any services you've requested, and to manage our relationship with you, including:</p> <p><b>To operate the Sites and Services:</b> We use the collected information to help us administer our Sites and services, authenticate users for security purposes, provide personalized user features and access, and process transactions between you and Minter.io. </p> <p><b>To communicate with you:</b> We communicate with you via email, or other means available on or through the Services (for example, via live chat or in-app notifications) about your use of our Sites, and services, product announcements, software updates, as well as transactional and service messages, such as welcoming you to our Services or informing you of issues with your account, for example if your social account has disconnected.

We use service providers for specific services and functions, including email communication, customer support services, payment processors, and accountancy. We may also share your data with analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement of our Sites. These service providers may only access, process, or store personal data pursuant to our instructions and to perform their duties to us.</p> <p><b>Regulators</b>, government agencies, law enforcement bodies, courts or other third parties where we think it's necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations or to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights.</p> <p><b>Other third parties</b> in connection with a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization, sale of some or all of our assets or stock, public offering of securities, or steps in consideration of such activities (e.g., due diligence). In these cases some or all of your personal information may be shared with or transferred to another entity, subject to this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><b>Other third parties</b> where we have your explicit consent to share your personal data. </p> <br><h3>Data storage and security</h3> <p>We're committed to protecting your personal data and have implemented reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to our servers, and to safeguard data. We have implemented such technology and security features ourselves or purchased them from specialised third parties, and we maintain strict internal guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorised access or improper use. Backups are run to prevent loss of information, and we will continue to enhance security as new technology becomes available. We encrypt our services and payment process using secure sockets layer (SSL) and/or transport layer security (TLS). Access to your account requires password verification. Please note that despite these measures, no website can guarantee data to be 100% secure.</p> <br><h3>International data transfers </h3> <p>Your data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country you live in – such as to the United States, where some of our service provider's servers are located. That country may not provide the same level of data protection as your own country. Whenever we transfer your information outside of Europe, we will take steps which are reasonably necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information and to make sure it is treated securely.</p> <br><h3>Deletion</h3> <p>You can remove personal information we hold about you at any time by logging into your account, accessing the Settings page, and then deleting your account.</p> <br><h3>Retention</h3> <p>You can remove your personal data from Minter.io at any time by deleting your account as described above. However, we may keep some of your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary for our legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention and financial reporting and compliance reasons.</p> <br><h3>Your rights</h3> <p>You have certain rights in respect to your personal information, including the right to access, correct, or delete personal data we hold about you. You can:</p> <p><b>Request access to the data that we have about you.</b> You can export a copy of your personal data in your account settings or request it by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@minter.io">privacy@minter.io</a>.
