<h2 class="bullet">Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p><b>Registration</b></p>
<p>To use this website, first complete the registration form and create a user name and password. During registration, you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest such as participating in our surveys.</p>
<p>You have the option to provide demographic information (such as income level, gender and zip code). We encourage you to submit this information since omission of this information may hinder your being eligible to participate in certain surveys.</p>

We do not provide contact information to third parties without notifying you prior to sharing the information.</p>
<p><b>Surveys</b></p>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to participate in multiple surveys on our site.  We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys; however, we will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.  For example, if you agree to participate in a product test, we may need to share your personal information such as your name and mailing address with our client in order for the client to send you the product that you will be testing. In these cases you will be notified prior to our sharing the information and you can choose whether to in the product test. We would not allow our clients to use your information for any other purpose other than to send you the product to be tested.  For reward purposes, a randomly generated unique identifier will be used for completion tracking.</p>

<p><b>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</b></p>
<p>As a data collection facility, we share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers.  This information does not identify individual users.

<p>This privacy policy applies only to information collected by this Website.</p>


<h2 class="bullet">Co-branded sites</h2>
<p>Co-branding is the method of having a user connect with a different website but make it appear to be the same site.

Information provided to the clients is outlined in the Information Sharing and Disclosure section.</p>

<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@mindfieldonline.com">support@mindfieldonline.com</a>  or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.</p>


<h2 class="bullet">Security</h2>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
