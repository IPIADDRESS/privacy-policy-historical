<p>We provide you the opportunity to participate in multiple surveys on our site.  We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys; however, we will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.  For example, if you agree to participate in a product test, we may need to share your personal information such as your name and mailing address with our client in order for the client to send you the product that you will be testing. In these cases you will be notified prior to our sharing the information and you can choose whether to in the product test. We would not allow our clients to use your information for any other purpose other than to send you the product to be tested.
