  <p>
    <b>What personal information is collected?</b>
    </p><p>
      We always collect emails and names. We also store IP addresses and the geolocation associated with it.
      Other information can be stored by opting to fill in profile forms.
    </p>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    <b>How and why is this personal information collected?</b>
    </p><p>
      Email, names, and additional information are collected manually by user input through web forms. Email and
name are collected at sign up, to help identify the user’s account. The additional information is collected by opting
to fill out a user profile, or by providing information as requested during a challenge. Additional information is captured for challenges
to be shown and shared with the third party hosting the challenge. IP addresses and
locations are automatically picked up when creating an account.
    </p>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    <b>How is the personal information used?</b>
    </p><p>
      Names and additional information are shown on the challenge ‘dashboard’ which shows all
submissions to the challenge of the hosting company. Locations are aggregated into a map for
demographic/informational purposes, but does not provide location information for specific users. The IP is
used to help in detecting spam or falsified information. Emails are used for login purposes and identifying
accounts during support. The information is kept indefinitely unless requested for removal by the owner of
the personal information. If you require any assistance regarding your account and personal information, contact us at
help@mindsumo.com.
    </p>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    <b>How is personal information protected?</b>
    </p><p>
      All transactions and data storage uses data encryption. Additionally, passwords are hashed and salted for
further protection. Challenge dashboards only provide information on the users who have attempted to
submit or draft a solution for the challenge.
    </p>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    <b>Do any third parties have access to personal information?</b>
    </p><p>
      Names, emails, and session information is shared with a few third parties for analytics purposes. These
include, but are not restricted to, Google, Facebook, Bing, and LinkedIn. These third parties act as data processors
while we act as the data controller. Names are shared with the company hosting the challenge through their
challenge dashboard. Additional information is only provided with explicit consent from users or if provided
as part of a submission to a challenge.
    </p>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    <b>What cookies are present and how are they used?</b>
    </p><p>
      We use cookies to remember login sessions during page navigation, remember previous login sessions, and
to track user actions for analytics and improvement purposes for ourselves. Cookies are also stored on
Google’s behalf for analytics purposes so that we may improve the platform.
    </p>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    <b>How can personal information be controlled?</b>
    </p><p>
      All personal information except IP address can be controlled through our user profile page, which is
accessible when going to the drop down menu in the top right when logged in, then selecting “Profile”.
Additionally, if you require any assistance regarding your account and personal information, contact us at
help@mindsumo.com.
