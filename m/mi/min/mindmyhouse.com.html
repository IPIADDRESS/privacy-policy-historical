<p><strong><a name="q1"></a>Q. What information does MindMyHouse.com require from 
  members?</strong></p>
<p>  Different types of personal information are required to complete 
  home owner memberships and house sitter memberships. </p>
<p> Home owner members must provide the following information: an email address, 
  a password, a first and last name, country of residence, the country that the 
  house sitting assignment is located, an advert which describes the house sitting 
  assignment in sufficient detail, the beginning and end date of the house sitting 
  assignment. </p>
<p> House sitter members must provide the following information: an email address, 
  a password, a first and last name, a list of the countries members would like 
  to be considered for house sitting assignments in, the beginning and end dates 
  of the period that the member is available for house sitting, an advert describing 
  the house sitting services on offer, a credit or debit card number (if this 
  is the payment option chosen), a home address, a billing address which matches 
  that attached to the card used for payment.</p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" border="0" class="arrow">top</a></div><p><strong> <a name="q2"></a>Q. How does MindMyHouse.com use members’ information?</strong></p>
<p> Information provided to the site in the course of becoming a member of MindMyHouse.com 
  will only be used to facilitate members’ full and effective use of the 
  site.</p>
<p> MindMyHouse.com will not disclose any of its members’ private information 
  to any third party under normal circumstances. Home owner members’ private 
  information includes: first and last names, email address and password. House 
  sitter members’ private information includes: home address, credit and 
  debit card numbers, billing address and password. </p>
<p> Neither will MindMyHouse.com individually identify any member to a third party 
  except when required to do so under the law; either in an emergency or to protect 
  the health and safety of its members or the general public.</p>
<p> MindMyHouse.com reserves the right to collate statistical data from members 
  in order to track site usage patterns . This process will not identify any individual 
  member and will only be used in efforts to improve the site and services to 
  members.</p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" border="0" class="arrow">top</a></div><div class="privacychanges"><p> <strong><a name="q3a"></a>Q. Who sees home owners members’ personal information?</strong></p>
<p>Only those people working for MindMyHouse.com will be able to see members' personal information as it is supplied by members and stored in the site's database.</p>
<p>MindMyHouse.com recognizes that home owner members may like to preserve their anonymity until they are interviewing house sitting candidates directly. For this reason, home owner members' email addresses are completely hidden from view online. Home owner members can only be contacted via a blank email contact form on the site. Only registered house sitter members will be able to contact home owner members in this way. However please note that MindMyHouse.com cannot safeguard your privacy if you choose to include personal details such as your name, email address or street address in any adverts you create and publish on the site. </p>

<p>If home owners publish a sitter wanted advert, a map will accompany the advert that will show the city/town/location of the house sitting assignment. Please note that this map is limited in detail - the zoom function has been limited so that users can only see the city/town or area of the assignment. Details such as the street or postcode (zipcode) remain hidden.</p>
</div>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" border="0" class="arrow">top</a></div><div class="privacychanges"><p> <strong><a name="q3b"></a>Q. Who sees house sitters members’ personal information?</strong></p>
<p>Only those people working for MindMyHouse.com will be able to see members' personal information as it is supplied by members and stored in the site's database. However, many elements of house sitter members' personal information are viewable online by registered MindMyHouse.com home owner members.</p>

<p>House sitter members' contact details including first and last names, country of residence, phone numbers (optional) and an email address are only visible online when house sitters create a sitter available advert. This information can then be seen by any person who joins MindMyHouse.com as a home owner member. House sitter members' home addresses are never displayed online nor given to any third party except when requested by the police in the interest of public safety.</p>

<p>House sitter members who create and publish their own sitter available advert have the option of being included in MindMyHouse.com's Local Sitter Search. Registered home owner members will then be able to search for and see house sitters' city/town/area of residence (based on the address they used to register with the service) displayed on a map. </p>

<p>Please note that this map is limited in detail – the zoom function has been limited so that home owners can only see very generally where in the town/city or area of residence the house sitter is located. Details such as the street or postcode (zipcode) remain hidden.</p>

  material?</strong></p>
<p> MindMyHouse.com will not send members any spam or unrelated junkmail. However, 
  from time to time MindMyHouse.com may send out updates on its service. Members

<p> A cookie is a small amount of data that MindMyHouse.com generates for each 
  member every time they log in to the site. MindMyHouse.com uses a temporary

  when they are paying for their MindMyHouse.com membership by credit or debit 
  card? </strong></p>

  transactions are secure – be assured that all financial information members

  transit and is safe from theft. Please note that when conducting a payment with 
  PayPal, their privacy policy will also apply in addition to the MindMyHouse.com

  information?</strong></p>
<p> Members are able to access, update and delete their information at any time, 
  by logging into their own account area on the site with their own customisable 
  password and following the relevant instructions. Any changes, additions or 
  deletions to members’ information will be effective immediately. However, 
  MindMyHouse.com reserves the right to view and return any inappropriate material 
  to members for re-submission. Members are required to keep their information 
  as current and accurate as possible under the terms of the Terms and Conditions of Use 
  document.</p>

  personal information on MindMyHouse.com from another website?</strong></p>
<p> Some attempts at making shortcut links to particular pages on Mindmyhouse.com 
  may fail. This is because some of the pages in members’ account areas 
  are password protected. In order to access any of their own password-protected 
  information individual members must login to the site through the MindMyHouse.com 
  homepage. </p>

  sites?</strong></p>
<p> Members may link to third party websites from within their personal sitter 
  available adverts although MindMyHouse.com reserves the right to remove the 
  link if it is deemed inappropriate. MindMyHouse.com’s Privacy Policy does 
  not apply once the user has left the site for another website. </p>
<p> The onus is on members to check the privacy policy of the site they have linked 
  to for information on the security of any information they may submit to that 
  site. </p>

<p> MindMyHouse.com may also contain links to other web sites and advertising. 
  MindMyHouse.com’s Privacy Policy does not apply once the user has left

  their membership expires?</strong></p>
<p> MindMyHouse.com stores house sitter members’ information in the database 
  for a calendar year after membership expiry. If membership is resumed using 
  the original email address within that period all of the information can be 
  retrieved for use by the house sitter member. If, however, membership is not 
  resumed within one year of the membership expiring, all the expired house sitter 
  members’ information is deleted permanently. </p>
<p> MindMyHouse.com’s home owner memberships do not expire in the same way 
  as house sitters memberships do as home owner members have free access to the 
  site. If home owner members wish to cancel their account on MindMyHouse.com 
  they can email <a href="mailto:support@mindmyhouse.com">support@mindmyhouse.com</a> 
  to arrange the removal of their membership account from the site.</p>

  when communicating with MindMyHouse.com?</strong></p>
<p> MindMyHouse.com values all of the feedback provided by members. Information 
  submitted in this way will not be used in any way to compromise MindMyHouse.com’s 
  obligations to members under the Privacy Policy. Feedback and other correspondence 
  will be used in the constant effort to improve the site and the service provided 
  to members. </p>
<p> However, MindMyHouse.com would very much like to publish, in part or in whole, 
  selected members’ testimonials about the usefulness of the site and members’ 
  tales of house sitting experiences in general. Before any such material is published 
  on the site, MindMyHouse.com will expressly seek permission to do so from its
