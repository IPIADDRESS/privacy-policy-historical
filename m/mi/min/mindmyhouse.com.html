<p><strong><a name="q1"></a>Q. What information does MindMyHouse require from 
  members?</strong></p>
<p>  Different types of personal information are required to complete 
  home owner memberships and house sitter memberships. </p>
<p> Home owner members must provide the following information: an email address, 
  a password, a first and last name, country of residence, the country that the 
  house sitting assignment is located, an advert or listing which describes the house sitting 
  assignment in sufficient detail, the beginning and end date of the house sitting 
  assignment. </p>
<p> House sitter members must provide the following information: an email address, 
  a password, a first and last name, a list of the countries members would like 
  to be considered for house sitting assignments in, the beginning and end dates 
  of the period that the member is available for house sitting, an advert or listing describing 
  the house sitting services on offer, a credit or debit card number (if this 
  is the payment option chosen), a home address, a billing address which matches 
  that attached to the card used for payment.</p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p><strong> <a name="q2"></a>Q. How does MindMyHouse use members’ information?</strong></p>
<p> Information provided to the site in the course of becoming a member of MindMyHouse 
  will only be used to facilitate members’ full and effective use of the 
  site.</p>
<p> MindMyHouse will not disclose any of its members’ private information 
  to any third party under normal circumstances. Home owner members’ private 
  information includes: first and last names, email address and password. House 
  sitter members’ private information includes: home address, credit and 
  debit card numbers, billing address and password. </p>
<p> Neither will MindMyHouse individually identify any member to a third party 
  except when required to do so under the law; either in an emergency or to protect 
  the health and safety of its members or the general public.</p>
<p> MindMyHouse reserves the right to collate statistical data from members 
  in order to track site usage patterns . This process will not identify any individual 
  member and will only be used in efforts to improve the site and services to 
  members.</p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><div class="privacychanges"><p> <strong><a name="q3a"></a>Q. Who sees home owners members’ personal information?</strong></p>
<p>Only those people working for MindMyHouse will be able to see members' personal information as it is supplied by members and stored in the site's database.</p>
<p>MindMyHouse recognizes that home owner members may like to preserve their anonymity until they are interviewing house sitting candidates directly. For this reason, home owner members' email addresses are completely hidden from view online. Home owner members can only be contacted via a blank email contact form on the site. Only registered house sitter members will be able to contact home owner members in this way. However please note that MindMyHouse cannot safeguard your privacy if you choose to include personal details such as your name, email address or street address in any adverts or listings you create and publish on the site. </p>

<p>If home owners publish a sitter wanted advert or listing, a map will accompany the advert or listing that will show the city/town/location of the house sitting assignment. Please note that this map is limited in detail - the zoom function has been limited so that users can only see the city/town or area of the assignment. Details such as the street or postcode (zipcode) remain hidden.</p>
</div>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><div class="privacychanges"><p> <strong><a name="q3b"></a>Q. Who sees house sitters members’ personal information?</strong></p>
<p>Only those people working for MindMyHouse will be able to see members' personal information as it is supplied by members and stored in the site's database. However, many elements of house sitter members' personal information are viewable online by registered MindMyHouse home owner members.</p>

<p>House sitter members' contact details including first and last names, country of residence, phone numbers (optional) and an email address are only visible online when house sitters create a sitter available advert or listing. This information can then be seen by any person who joins MindMyHouse as a home owner member. House sitter members' home addresses are never displayed online nor given to any third party except when requested by the police in the interest of public safety.</p>

<p>House sitter members who create and publish their own sitter available advert or listing have the option of being included in MindMyHouse's Local Sitter Search. Registered home owner members will then be able to search for and see house sitters' city/town/area of residence (based on the address they used to register with the service) displayed on a map. </p>

<p>Please note that this map is limited in detail – the zoom function has been limited so that home owners can only see very generally where in the town/city or area of residence the house sitter is located. Details such as the street or postcode (zipcode) remain hidden.</p>

  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p> <strong><a name="q4"></a>Q. Will MindMyHouse be sending members any unsolicited 
  material?</strong></p>
<p> MindMyHouse will not send members any spam or unrelated junkmail. However, 
  from time to time MindMyHouse may send out updates on its service. Members 
  will also receive automated emails from MindMyHouse (eg. successful registration, 
  email alerts etc.). In addition, members may choose to subscribe to a general 
  members’ mailing list containing relevant material to its members. Members 
  will be able to unsubscribe from this mailing list by following the ‘unsubscribe’ 
  directions contained within each such email. </p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p> <strong><a name="q5"></a>Q. What are cookies? Are they required?</strong></p>
<p> A cookie is a small amount of data that MindMyHouse generates for each 
  member every time they log in to the site. MindMyHouse uses a temporary 
  cookie which contains only a single session identification number to allow a 
  user to remain logged in to MindMyHouse . Once the user closes their browser 
  window, quits or logs out of MindMyHouse, this cookie is automatically destroyed. 
  This cookie does not contain any personal or private information. This technology 
  allows MindMyHouse to streamline members’ use of the site. Members 
  need to make sure that their browser is ‘cookies enabled’ for the 
  customisable elements of MindMyHouse to work properly. By using this technology, 
  MindMyHouse can effectively reduce the time that it takes members to log 
  in, customize their home pages and submit any requests to the site. Cookies 
  will not be used by MindMyHouse to retrieve any information about members. 
  No other company has access to cookies placed on members’ computers by 
  MindMyHouse. </p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p> <strong><a name="q6"></a>Q. How secure are members’ account areas?</strong></p>
<p> MindMyHouse takes the security and privacy of its members’ information 
  seriously. In order to give members confidence in the privacy of their personal 
  account area on the site, each individual member account area is protected by 
  a combination of email address and secret password access. </p>
<p> Please note that MindMyHouse does not hold any credit or debit card information 
  online.</p>
<p> Please also note that MindMyHouse will not ask for members’ passwords 
  at any time. If you are asked for your password by a third party or someone 
  posing as a representative of MindMyHouse do not give up this information! 
  Requests of this nature could be an attempt to obtain access to your account 
  area illegally. </p>
<p> MindMyHouse endeavours to ensure that the servers used to host the website 
  and data are secure. However, MindMyHouse cannot guarantee that unauthorised 
  access by third parties will not occur.</p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p> <strong><a name="q7"></a>Q. How can members help safeguard the assurances 
  provided in this Privacy Policy?</strong></p>
<p> Members need to ensure that they observe the following general protocol:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Always log out of MindMyHouse at the end of a session!</li>
  <li>Memorise your password and keep it secret </li>
  <li>Don’t let anyone log into MindMyHouse on your behalf if you don’t 
    trust them with your personal information</li>
</ul>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p> <strong><a name="q8"></a>Q. How secure is members’ financial information 
  when they are paying for their MindMyHouse membership by credit or debit 
  card? </strong></p>
<p> MindMyHouse uses the industry leader, PayPal for all online transactions. PayPal 
  transactions are secure – be assured that all financial information members 
  supply when paying for annual house sitter memberships is encrypted while in 
  transit and is safe from theft. Please note that when conducting a payment with 
  PayPal, their privacy policy will also apply in addition to the MindMyHouse 
  privacy policy.</p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p> <strong><a name="q9"></a>Q. How can members access, update or delete their 
  information?</strong></p>
<p> Members are able to access, update and delete their information at any time, 
  by logging into their own account area on the site with their own customisable 
  password and following the relevant instructions. Any changes, additions or 
  deletions to members’ information will be effective immediately. However, 
  MindMyHouse reserves the right to view and return any inappropriate material 
  to members for re-submission. Members are required to keep their information 
  as current and accurate as possible under the terms of the Terms and Conditions of Use 
  document.</p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p><strong> <a name="q10"></a>Q. Can someone else link to members’ 
  personal information on MindMyHouse from another website?</strong></p>
<p> Some attempts at making shortcut links to particular pages on Mindmyhouse.com 
  may fail. This is because some of the pages in members’ account areas 
  are password protected. In order to access any of their own password-protected 
  information individual members must login to the site through the MindMyHouse 
  homepage. </p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p> <strong><a name="q11"></a>Q. What is the policy regarding links to third party 
  sites?</strong></p>
<p> Members may link to third party websites from within their personal sitter 
  available adverts or listings although MindMyHouse reserves the right to remove the 
  link if it is deemed inappropriate. MindMyHouse’s Privacy Policy does 
  not apply once the user has left the site for another website. </p>
<p> The onus is on members to check the privacy policy of the site they have linked 
  to for information on the security of any information they may submit to that 
  site. </p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p> <strong><a name="q12"></a>Q. When does this Privacy Policy not apply?</strong></p>
<p> MindMyHouse may also contain links to other web sites and advertising. 
  MindMyHouse’s Privacy Policy does not apply once the user has left 
  the site for another website. The onus is on members to check the privacy policy 
  of the site they have linked to for information on the security of any information 
  they may submit to that site.</p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p> <strong><a name="q13"></a>Q. What happens to members’ information after 
  their membership expires?</strong></p>
<p> MindMyHouse stores house sitter members’ information in the database 
  for a calendar year after membership expiry. If membership is resumed using 
  the original email address within that period all of the information can be 
  retrieved for use by the house sitter member. If, however, membership is not 
  resumed within one year of the membership expiring, all the expired house sitter 
  members’ information is deleted permanently. </p>
<p> MindMyHouse’s home owner memberships do not expire in the same way 
  as house sitters memberships do as home owner members have free access to the 
  site. If home owner members wish to cancel their account on MindMyHouse 
  they can email <a href="mailto:support@mindmyhouse.com">support@mindmyhouse.com</a> 
  to arrange the removal of their membership account from the site.</p>
  <div class="toplink"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/icons/arrow_orange_up.gif" alt="up to top of page" width="9" height="8" class="arrow">top</a></div><p> <strong><a name="q14"></a>Q. What happens to the information members provide 
  when communicating with MindMyHouse?</strong></p>
<p> MindMyHouse values all of the feedback provided by members. Information 
  submitted in this way will not be used in any way to compromise MindMyHouse’s 
  obligations to members under the Privacy Policy. Feedback and other correspondence 
  will be used in the constant effort to improve the site and the service provided 
  to members. </p>
<p> However, MindMyHouse would very much like to publish, in part or in whole, 
  selected members’ testimonials about the usefulness of the site and members’ 
  tales of house sitting experiences in general. Before any such material is published 
  on the site, MindMyHouse will expressly seek permission to do so from its

<p> <strong><a name="q15"></a>Q. How is members’ information protected under 
  United Kingdom law?</strong></p>
<p> The core business of MindMyHouse is providing a storage and retrieval 
  system for information provided by registered members from around the world. 
  As ‘data controllers’ MindMyHouse must notify the Information 
  Commissioner about the types of information held and the purposes for which 
  personal data is processed. This information is entered into the public register 
  of data controllers which is maintained by the Information Commissioner. The 
  Information Commissioner is an independent official appointed by the Crown to 
  oversee the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. 
</p>
<p> MindMyHouse complies with the following eight guiding principles of the 
  Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
<ol>
  <li> process personal data fairly and lawfully</li>
  <li>obtain personal data only for one or more specified and lawful purposes 
    and to ensure that such data is not processed in a manner which is incompatible 
    with the purpose or purposes for which it was obtained</li>
  <li>ensure that personal data is adequate, relevant and not excessive for the 
    purpose or purposes for which it is held</li>
  <li>ensure that personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date</li>
  <li>ensure that personal data is not kept for any longer than is necessary for 
    the purpose for which it was obtained</li>
  <li>process personal data in accordance with the rights of the individuals to 
    whom the information relates</li>
  <li>ensure that personal data is kept secure</li>
  <li>ensure that personal data is not transferred to a country outside the European 
    Economic Area unless the country to which the information is to be sent ensures 
    an adequate level of protection for the rights (in relation to the information) 
    of the individuals to whom the personal data relates.</li>
</ol>
