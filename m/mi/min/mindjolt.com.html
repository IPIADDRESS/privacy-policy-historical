			<p><em>Effective Date: May 25, 2018</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Jam City, Inc., the registered office of which is at 3525 Eastham Drive, Culver City, CA 90232, USA<br>
(“<strong>Jam City</strong>”, or “<strong>we</strong>”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures<br>
regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Data we receive from users of our games<br>
and other services we provide (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”) and as well as from users of any of our<br>
applications, whether on third party websites or as an application for mobile devices (collectively,<br>
the “<strong>Application</strong>”). The terms “<strong>Personal Data</strong>” and “<strong>Processing</strong>” have the meaning set out in Art. 4<br>
of the European General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”). The term “<strong>Services</strong>”, as used in<br>
this Privacy Policy, includes both the Service and the Application. This Privacy Policy applies only<br>
to Personal Data that you provide to us (or permit third party sites to provide us) or that we collect<br>
through the Services. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of<br>
any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the primary access points to the<br>
Services. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>In the course of using the Services, you may provide us with Personal Data either directly or we<br>
may receive it indirectly (from others).</p>
<p><em>Access data:</em><br>
When you register through the Services as a registered user or when you choose to create your<br>
own profile we may collect the following Personal Data from you directly:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">● Your name;<br>
● Email address;<br>
● Birthday;<br>
● Gender;<br>
● Zip code/Postal Code;<br>
● Username<br>
● Device ID</p>
<p>We also may receive Personal Data related to you from others if you sign-up to use the Services<br>
directly via the Service or Application or via certain third party social networking sites (each, a<br>
“<strong>Social Networking Service</strong>”). In this case, we may extract Personal Data you have provided to<br>
such Social Networking Service (information you make available via the Social Networking Service)<br>
from the account you have with such Social Networking Service and use that Personal Data to<br>
create your Jam City account. In this regard, we may extract the following Personal Data:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">● Your name;<br>
● Email address;<br>
● Birthday;<br>
● Gender;<br>
● Zip code/Postal Code;<br>
● Username<br>
● Device ID<br>
● Facebook ID</p>
<p>The Personal Data we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the respective<br>
Social Networking Service.<br>
The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR (legitimate interest) as the provision<br>
of this Personal Data is necessary for us to perform the contract with you. If you do not provide us<br>
the relevant Personal Data you may not be able to use our Services completely.</p>
<p><em>Data we receive indirectly:</em></p>
<p>We also may extract the following Personal Data when you are using the Services or are<br>
navigating to the Services from other (third party) websites:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">● individual preferences;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">● certain information about your computer or mobile device: operating system, software<br>
version and unique advertising identifier;</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR (legitimate interest) as we wish to<br>
improve our Services permanently and therefore need to analyse our users’ preferences and<br>
technical background.</p>
<p><em>Purchase data:</em></p>
<p>If you choose to purchase any virtual goods as part of your use of the Services, to the extent<br>
available, we or our third party service providers may collect the following Personal Data from you<br>
in order to facilitate your payment for such virtual goods:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">● Purchase history (does NOT include payment method details or banking information)</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR (performance of a contract) as the<br>
provision of this Personal Data is necessary for us to perform our contract with you. If you do not<br>
provide us the relevant Personal Data you may not be able to use our Services completely.</p>
<p><em>Log Data:</em></p>
<p>When you use the Services, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user (any of these, a<br>
“<strong>Jam City User</strong>”), for example in accessing our Services through a Social Networking Service, our<br>
servers automatically record data that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“<strong>Log</strong><br>
<strong>Data</strong>”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>”)<br>
address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Service, pages of<br>
the websites involved in the Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you<br>
search for, access times and dates, and other statistics.<br>
The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR (legitimate interest) as we wish to<br>
improve our Services permanently and therefore need to analyse our users’ preferences and<br>
usage habits.</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em></p>
<p>Like many websites, our Service uses “cookies” to collect data. A cookie is a small data file that we<br>
transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We do not link the data we store<br>
in cookies to any Personal Data you submit while using our Services.<br>
Subject to your prior consent, we may participate in behavioural-based advertising. This means<br>
that a third party may place a cookie on your browser, or use a web beacon, to collect data about<br>
your use of our website so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to<br>
your interest (“Tracking Cookies”). That advertising may appear either on our Service, or on other<br>
websites. We may ask you to consent to our use of such Tracking Cookies before we start using<br>
them. If you consented to the use of Tracking Cookies in the beginning, you can, at any time,<br>
instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before<br>
accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. On mobile you can reset your settings by taking the</p>
<p>following steps (for iOS:&nbsp;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074 and for Android:<br>
https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en). If you do not accept cookies, however,<br>
you may not be able to use all portions of the website or all functionality of our Services.<br>
The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR (consent).<br>
Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be “tracked”<br>
online. At this time we do not modify your experience based upon whether such a signal is<br>
broadcast.<br>
We do not use any automated decision-making, including profiling.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Processing</strong></p>
<p><em>Access data, data we receive indirectly and purchase data:</em></p>
<p>We use your Personal Data (<em>access data, data we receive indirectly and purchase data as listed</em><br>
<em>above</em>) to provide our Services to you and administer your inquiries. Subject to your prior consent,<br>
we also use your Personal Data to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional<br>
materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no<br>
longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions<br>
provided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences” section in your profile<br>
webpage. (See “Changing or Deleting Information” below.)</p>
<p><em>Log Data:</em></p>
<p>We use the Log Data to monitor and analyze your use of the Services and for the Service’s<br>
technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to<br>
better tailor the Services to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this Log Data is collected so<br>
that when you use our Services again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other<br>
information appropriate to your interests. We also use this Log Data to verify that visitors to the<br>
Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal<br>
Data or use it in association with other Personal Data, though we may aggregate, analyze and<br>
evaluate such Log Data for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying<br>
Information.</p>
<p><em>Cookies:</em></p>
<p>We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID<br>
and login password for future logins. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain<br>
features of the Services in order to better understand how you interact with the Services and to<br>
monitor aggregate usage by Jam City Users and web traffic routing. Unlike persistent cookies,<br>
session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close<br>
your browser. We use Tracking Cookies to be able to address you with advertisements matching<br>
your interest.</p>
<p><strong>Data Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
<p><em>Jam City Registered Users:</em></p>
<p>If you register through the Services on the Service and submit your Personal Data to create a<br>
profile webpage, other registered users will see your “User Name” (“Subscriber Identifier”). You can<br>
choose what other Personal Data you provide as part of your profile (“Other Subscriber<br>
Information”) and in some cases you can choose whether to share that information publicly<br>
through the Services by making selections via the “user preferences” section of your profile<br>
webpage. Providing Other Subscriber Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree<br>
of interaction you want to have with other Jam City Users. We recommend that you guard your<br>
anonymity and sensitive Personal Data and that you not use your real name as your “User Name,”<br>
since that would allow others to identify you.<br>
In particular, we may decide to share IDFA, IDFV, IP address and aggregated information with<br>
advertisers. Such information may be used to send you advertisements for products and services<br>
that are relevant to your interests if you have consented to such practice.<br>
For example, we may share the advertising identifier associated with your device (such as the<br>
Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID) with advertisers. An advertising identifier is an<br>
alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that advertisers can serve relevant<br>
ads to you. We use the Apple IDFA only as permitted by Apple, and we use the Android<br>
Advertising ID only as permitted by Google. An advertising identifier is assigned, and ad tracking is<br>
turned on, by default on your mobile device. You may limit the use of or reset your advertising<br>
device ID using the privacy settings on your mobile device; in some cases you may need to reset<br>
the operating system to reset the advertising device ID. We do not associate any of your Personal</p>
<p>Data with your advertising device ID without your consent (which may be given by you in our terms<br>
of use for an Application).</p>
<p><em>Service Providers:</em></p>
<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our services, to provide our<br>
Services on our behalf, to perform services related to our Services (e.g., without limitation,<br>
maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the website<br>
features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. These third parties have access to<br>
your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or<br>
use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p><em>Social Networking Sites:</em></p>
<p>We may share the information in your Jam City account profile (including your Personal Data) with<br>
the Social Networking Sites you have linked to your Jam City account to provide you with<br>
enhanced services. These third parties have access to your Personal Data only for this purpose<br>
(unless they legitimately have received your Personal Data independently of the Jam City service)<br>
and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p><em>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement:</em></p>
<p>Jam City cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce<br>
and comply with the law. We will disclose any Personal Data about you to government or law<br>
enforcement officials if required by law.</p>
<p><em>Business Transfers:</em></p>
<p>Jam City may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal<br>
Data, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of<br>
bankruptcy.</p>

supervisory authority.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>● Right to Withdraw Consent</em><br>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Jam City is concerned with safeguarding your Personal Data.<br>
Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context<br>
and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and<br>
freedoms of natural persons, we have implemented appropriate technical and organizational<br>
measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in accordance with Art. 32 of the<br>
GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Data Breach</strong></p>
<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any Personal Data Breach (as defined in Art. 4 no<br>
12 of the GDPR) to you via email, mail, telephone, or conspicuous posting on our website in the<br>
most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the<br>
legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the<br>
breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. We reserve the right to choose<br>
which method we use to contact you about such an event.</p>
<p><strong>International Transfer</strong></p>
<p>Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your<br>
state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as<br>
protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to<br>
provide Personal Data to us, Jam City transfers Personal Data to the United States and processes</p>
<p>it there. For such cases we will contractually ensure that the protection level regarding your<br>
Personal Data is the same as ours (“safeguards”).</p>
<p><strong>Retention Period</strong></p>
<p>We will store your Personal Data for the time necessary to perform our Services to you.</p>
<p><strong>Our Policy Towards Children</strong></p>
<p>These Services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data<br>
from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us<br>
with Personal Data without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@jamcity.com. If<br>
we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Data, we will delete such<br>
information from our files.</p>
<p><strong>Phishing</strong></p>
<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Jam City.<br>
Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will<br>
not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national<br>
identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more<br>
information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
<p>Our Services may provide links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking<br>
on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be<br>
directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or<br>
other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation<br>
with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or<br>
practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place<br>
their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect or solicit Personal Data from you. Other<br>
websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Data you submit to<br>
them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
<p>However, we will ensure contractually that everyone we share your Personal Data with provides for<br>
sufficient security measures.</p>
