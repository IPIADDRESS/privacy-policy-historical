      <br>
Collecting Your Personal Information <br>
      <br>
I am committed to protecting your privacy. I will only use the
information that I collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the
Data Protection Act 1998). I will not pass on your details to any third
party and do not send out marketing e-mails to customers unless they

Generally, this information is requested when you are either
downloading free products, when you purchase any of my products
(eBooks, software etc.), or when you subscribe to my newsletters. I
will never collect sensitive information about you without your
explicit consent. The information I hold will be accurate and up to
date. You can check the information that I hold about you by e-mailing
us at <span style="font-weight: bold;">mingjong@MingJongTey.com</span>.

      <br>
How I Control Your Personal Information
I will not use your personal information for any other reason other
than to contact you. We do not sell, give away or rent your email
address to any third party. If in the future I did for any reason wish
to rent, sell or use your email address for any other purpose we will
ask you for your permission first. <br>
      <br>
How We Use Your Personal Information <br>
      <br>
Your personal information is used for four main purposes and they are
as follows: <br>

      <br>
2. To provide assistance to you after you have purchased products from
me. <br>
      <br>
3. To help me create and deliver content most relevant to you. <br>
      <br>
4. To enlighten you about new products, services, tool, upgrades,
special offers and information which I feel may be of use to you. <br>
      <br>
I will only disclose your personal information, without notice, if
required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action
is necessary to: <br>
