    <p _ngcontent-c17="">Super League Gaming, Inc. (“SLG”) makes reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of your personal
        information. This Privacy Policy was created to demonstrate our commitment to fair information
        practices. This Privacy Policy covers SLG’s use of personal information that we collect in the normal
        course of our business, when you use our corporate websites (<a _ngcontent-c17="" href="http://www.superleague.com">www.superleague.com</a>, <a _ngcontent-c17="" href="http://www.framerate.gg">www.framerate.gg</a>, and <a _ngcontent-c17="" href="http://www.minehut.com">www.minehut.com</a>) and when you otherwise interact with us,
        including when you attend events hosted or attended by SLG and when you contact us for support
        (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">In addition to covering how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information, this policy
        also discloses our purpose and lawful basis for processing your information, and your related rights.
        Our legal basis for collecting and using personal information will depend on the personal information
        concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. In most cases, the lawful basis will be that
        the processing: &nbsp;(i) is necessary for our legitimate interests in carrying out our business with
        you, including direct marketing, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and
        interests, or (ii) is necessary to perform a contract with you. Where processing is based on your
        consent, we will identify the processing purposes and provide you with relevant information to make the
        processing fair and transparent. If you have consented to our use of information about you for a
        specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any
        processing that has already taken place.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">SLG may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. In the event we make any material changes to this
        Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting the revised policy on our corporate websites
        noted in the initial paragraph. When we update this Privacy Policy, we will note the date the most
        recent revision was posted below, at the end of the policy. Any revisions will become effective upon (7)
        calendar days following such posting on our corporate websites.</p>

                    must provide their email address, their age, a username and select either “Parent” or
                    “Gamer”. Those items are the only information required by our registration process, and we
                    do not require users under the age of 13, or any users, to disclose more information than is
                    reasonably necessary to participate in an activity. Once registered, each user over the age
                    of 13 has the option, but is not required, to complete an account profile with any of the
                    following additional information: first name, last name, street address, city,
                    state/province/region of residence, and country of residence. Users under the age of 13, or
                    their parents on their behalf, may optionally provide their name, create a SLG profile name,
                    and/or provide their username(s) on third-party gaming platforms (such as Minecraft). Our
                    Web site includes in-site communications tools (e.g., forums, comments, or chat), where it
                    is possible for users to provide personal information that is visible to other users.
                    Parents or guardians of children under 13 should note our in-site communications tools
                    permit a child user to post text or media (including photographs or video) through which the
                    child could provide personal information that would be visible to other users. Additionally,
                    at our in-person or in-theater events, we, our third-party partners, the media, and/or other
                    SLG members may wish to take photos, videos, or audio recordings of those in attendance.
                    When you use our Web site to purchase items, pay for attendance at events, or provide
                    verifiable parental consent to our use of personal information for those under the age of
                    13, we also require your billing information, such as a credit card number and billing

        inform parents and legal guardians (as used in this policy, “<strong _ngcontent-c17="">parents</strong>“) about our
        practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13
        (“<strong _ngcontent-c17="">children</strong>“). COPPA and the GDPR also require us to obtain verifiable consent from a
        child’s parent for certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child’s personal information.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17=""><strong _ngcontent-c17=""><u _ngcontent-c17="">Parents of users under 13 years old:</u></strong></p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">As a matter of policy, SLG does not collect personal information from any person under the age of
        13.&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure we comply with this policy, we utilize industry-accepted means of gating new
        users as they interact with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this policy were to change at any time in the future, SLG
        is committed to obtaining verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, or sharing any personal
        information from children under the age of 13. This would work as follows: Our account registration
        process screens users for age. Those under the age of 13 would be instructed to involve their parent or
        guardian in the registration process, and we would obtain the parent or guardian’s email address. SLG
        would then send direct notice to the parent or guardian via an email that advises the parent or guardian
        of the following:</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">1) that SLG will collect their online contact information to give them notice and subsequently update
        them about their child’s participation in our website;</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">2) that SLG wishes to collect personal information from their child;</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">3) that their consent is required for the collection, use, and disclosure of this information;</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">4) what information will be collected, and how it might be disclosed to others;</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">5) that this Privacy Policy describes our information use, collection, and deletion practices;</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">6) that consent can be given via a credit card transaction or by signing and returning a form; and</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">7) that if consent is not given within a reasonable time, SLG will delete the parent’s email address from
        its records.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">Through a link in the email, the parent or guardian is taken to a web page where he or she confirms
        receipt of the direct notice we sent via email, and provides verifiable parental consent by permitting
        us to charge a small amount to the parent’s or guardian’s credit card, debit card, or other online
        payment system that provides notification of each discrete transaction to the primary account holder.
    </p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">We verify the payment method by charging a small, nonrefundable fee to that account. This is the most
        common method allowed by law for obtaining verifiable parental consent. It costs us more to process the
        transaction than the amount the payment method is charged, and we do not make any money from the
        transaction. Alternatively, the direct notice we send parents and guardians also directs them to a
        downloadable consent form that can be printed, signed, and sent back to us via mail or electronic scan
        to:</p>

    <p _ngcontent-c17="">Parents or guardians of children under 13 can agree to our collection and use of their child’s
        information, but still opt out of our disclosure of such information to our partners. Parents or
        guardians may opt out of such disclosure when providing their consent, or by contacting us directly.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">Parents or guardians of children under 13 can review their child’s personal information, direct us to
        delete it, and refuse to allow further collection or use of the child’s information by contacting us
        directly at the address or number listed above. When deletion is requested, we ensure that a child’s
        personal information is deleted in a manner that safeguards against a security breach and protects
        against its unauthorized access or use, though it is possible the information may persist as residual
        copies or in our backup systems for some time after we have directed its deletion.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">If we make any material change in the collection, use, and disclosure practices described here, in
        addition to updating this Privacy Policy, if you are a parent or guardian of a child under 13 years old
        we will contact you at the email address we used to provide you with direct notice of our information
        collection, use, and retention practices in order to notify you of any such change.</p>

                    behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless SLG proves that it is not
                    responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</li>

        under or relating to the Privacy Policy, either party may choose to resolve the dispute by binding
        arbitration, as described below, instead of in court (the “Arbitration Agreement”). California law shall

        agreement, including the Class Action Waiver) may be resolved by binding arbitration if either side
        requests it. THIS MEANS IF EITHER YOU OR SLG CHOOSE ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO

    <p _ngcontent-c17="">Except for individuals covered by Privacy Shield, the Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal
        Arbitration Act (FAA). Arbitration must proceed only with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or
        Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS). The rules for the arbitration will be the procedures
        of the chosen arbitration organization. If the organization’s procedures change after the claim is
        filed, the procedures in effect when the claim was filed will apply. Arbitration hearings will take
        place in Los Angeles, California. A single arbitrator will be appointed. The arbitrator must:</p>

        <li _ngcontent-c17="" style="list-style-type: none;">
            <ul _ngcontent-c17="">

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p _ngcontent-c17="">The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding except for any review allowed by the FAA. However, if
        more than $100,000 was genuinely in dispute, then either you or SLG may choose to appeal to a new panel
        of three arbitrators. The appellate panel is completely free to accept or reject the entire original
        award or any part of it. The appeal must be filed with the arbitration organization not later than 30
        days after the original award issues. The appealing party pays all appellate costs unless the appellate
        panel determines otherwise as part of its award. Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through
        a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction.</p>
