    <h2 _ngcontent-c24="">PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Effective 1/15/19</p>

    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Minehut is committed to providing a safe and fun experience for its customers, which includes protecting your
        privacy and data. To enhance the enjoyment and experience of our customers, we collect certain information that
        can be used on its own, or with other information, for the purposes of direct contact, customer service or
        providing value-added experiences. This Privacy Policy is intended to give you a clear understanding of how we
        collect, use, protect, and otherwise handle such personally identifiable information. It also describes how you
        can tell us your preferences regarding our use of such information. We ensure that our Privacy Policy and
        information collection practices adhere to the laws of the countries in which we do business.</p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">What personal information do we collect?</h4>

    <p _ngcontent-c24="">When registering on our website, users must provide their email address, username and their age. These data
        points are the only information required by our registration process.</p>

    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Once registered, each user has the option, but is not required, to complete an account profile for free
        Minecraft server hosting that includes the following additional information: first name, last name, street
        address, city, state/province/region of residence, and country of residence, phone number, gender and some
        psychographic inputs. Our website includes, or may include, communications tools such as forms, forums and chat
        where it may be sometimes possible for users to provide personal information that is visible to other users.
        When you use our website to purchase items, we may also collect billing information such as a credit card
        number and billing address.</p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">When do we collect information?</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">We collect information when you register at www.minehut.com, when you complete and submit any of the optional
        information included in their account profile, when you make purchases, and when you interact with customer
        support. </p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">How do we use your information?</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">We use the information you provide us:</p>
    <ul _ngcontent-c24="">
        <li _ngcontent-c24="">To determine your age.</li>
        <li _ngcontent-c24="">To respond to inquiries and requests.</li>
        <li _ngcontent-c24="">To process transactions, fulfill orders, and prevent transactional fraud.</li>
        <li _ngcontent-c24="">To send periodic emails.</li>
        <li _ngcontent-c24="">To monitor and improve our site and services, support our internal operations, and for internal analysis.</li>
        <li _ngcontent-c24="">To protect the security and integrity of our site and business.</li>
        <li _ngcontent-c24="">As required by law.</li>
        <li _ngcontent-c24="">In other ways that are standard industry practice and do not conflict with your expectations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">How do we protect your information?</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">We use reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we
        collect. Our website is scanned on a regular basis to detect and address security vulnerabilities. We regularly
        scan our site and systems for malware. We maintain personal data information on secured servers only accessible
        by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems and are contractually required to
        keep the information confidential. Sensitive data is encrypted. We maintain the confidentiality, security, and
        integrity of the personal data and information we collect by taking reasonable steps to release such
        information only to parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality and security (see “Do we share your
        information?” below). We retain the personal information we collect for only as long as is reasonably necessary
        to fulfill the purpose for which we collected the information. After that, we ensure that the collected
        personal information is deleted in a manner that safeguards against a security breach and protects against its
        unauthorized access or use, though it is possible your information may persist as residual copies or in our
        backup systems for some time after we have directed its deletion. We also use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
        protocol on your account information and registration pages to protect sensitive personal information.
        Financial transactions are processed through a certified back-end provider and are not stored or processed on
        our servers.</p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">Do we use ‘cookies’?</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through
        your Web browser (if you allow), that enable the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser
        and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we can use cookies to help us remember you each
        time you visit our site, rather than requiring you to log in on each visit. They can also be used to help us
        understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with
        improved services. We can also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site
        interaction, so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">We use cookies to understand and save a user’s preferences for future visits. You can choose to have your
        computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this
        through your Web browser’s settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help Menu to
        learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">If you disable cookies (turn them off), some features on our website may be disabled, and some of our services
        may not function properly. However, many site features may also remain available even if you disable cookies.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">We do not use cookies or other technologies to track your activities on non-affiliated Minehut sites or
        services, or to serve advertisements based on your browsing activities on non-affiliated Minehut sites or
        services.</p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">Do we share your information?</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">We do not sell or otherwise share your information with any third parties, except for the limited purposes
        described below.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Service Providers: The personal information we collect may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with services
        engaged by us to support our internal operations (such as payment processing or mail/e-mail distribution), and
        to perform other technical and processing functions (such as storing data, maintaining data integrity,
        programming operations, user services or technology services). We may provide these services information we
        collect as needed to perform their functions, but they are prohibited from using that information for other
        purposes, and they specifically agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Some of these
        providers, such as payment processors, may request additional information during the course of offering their
        services. Before you provide additional information to third party providers, we encourage you to review their
        privacy policies and information collection practices.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Law Enforcement Safety: We may access, preserve, and/or disclose the information we collect and/or content you
        and/or your child (when applicable) provides to us (including information posted to our in-site communications
        tools) to a law enforcement agency or other third parties if required to do so by law or with a good faith
        belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
        (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce Minehut’s Terms of Use or other agreements; (iii) respond to claims
        that the content violates the rights of third parties; and (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal
        safety of the owners or users of Minehut, a third party, or the general public. We also may disclose
        information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our
        rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of others.
    </p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">In-Site Communications Tools:</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Our website includes various in-site communications tools (e.g., forums, comments, or chat). Please be aware
        that anyone may read postings on certain in-site communications tools. Any information which is posted to such
        in-site communications tools could include personal information, which would be disclosed and available to
        other users of that tool and would not therefore be private. Minehut cannot guarantee the security of
        information that any user discloses or communicates online in public areas. Those who do so, do so at their own
        risk. We reserve the right to monitor the content of our in-site communications tools. If age inappropriate
        material or potentially identifiable information is seen, it may be removed or edited by us for security,
        privacy and/or legal reasons. We will not republish postings from our in-site communications tools elsewhere
        on the Web.</p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">Social Media:</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Minehut and its staff and other representatives maintain accounts on various social media sites (e.g., Facebook
        and Twitter). </p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">Business transfer:</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Minehut is wholly-owned by Super League Gaming, Inc. and the personal information we have collected may be
        transferred to that entity at any time. Additionally, in a bankruptcy or reorganization, such information may
        be considered an asset and may be transferred or sold.</p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">How do I consent to and control your use of my personal information?</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">We strive to give you access to your personal information, and if that information is wrong, to allow you to
        update it easily or delete it (unless we’re required to keep that information for legitimate business or legal
        reasons). Should you wish to access or request deletion of any of the personal information you have provided
        us, please contact us at:</p>
    <pre _ngcontent-c24="">        Minehut
        2906 Colorado Ave.
        Santa Monica, CA 90404 USA
        support@minehut.com
    </pre>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">We may reject requests for access or deletion of personal information if they are unreasonably repetitive,
        require unreasonable technical measures (such as changing our business practices or developing new
        functionality), put others’ privacy at risk, or would be unreasonably impractical. We will not charge you for
        accessing or correcting your personal information except if doing so would require unreasonable expense to us.
        Though we will do our best to honor your request to delete data, it is possible your information may persist as
        residual copies or in our backup systems for some time after we have received and acted upon your request.</p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">Our commitment to children’s privacy:</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Protecting the privacy of children is of paramount importance to us. We understand that users who are under 13
        years of age need special safeguards and privacy protection. It is our intent to fully comply with the
        Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">Linking to and embedding from third party sites or services:</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">From time to time we may link to or embed content from non-affiliated Minehut sites or services on our Minehut
        website. In addition, the foregoing, may include the content or services provided by Super League Gaming, Inc.
        All third-party sites or services have separate and independent privacy policies and terms of use. We have no
        responsibility or liability for the content and activities of sites or services to which we may link, or from
        which we may embed, excluding Super League Gaming, Inc. with which we are affiliated. Except as set forth
        elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information with such sites or services. Nonetheless, we seek
        to protect the integrity of our site, and welcome any feedback or concern about sites or services to which we
        link or from which we embed.</p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">Can I visit your website anonymously?</h4>
    <p _ngcontent-c24="">Yes.</p>

    <h4 _ngcontent-c24="">How will I be notified of changes to this Privacy Policy?</h4>
