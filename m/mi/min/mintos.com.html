Transfer of information to third parties</strong></p><p>Mintos and our cooperation partners process the User’s personal data within the European Economic Area (hereinafter – EEA).</p><p>In accordance with Clause 13.3. of the Agreement Mintos has a right to disclose the User’s data to the entities specified below:</p><ul><li>to any person related to the fulfilment of commitments arising to Mintos from the Agreement (including to communications service providers, payment intermediaries, credit institutions, IT service providers, etc.);</li><li>to the parent company of Mintos, its governing enterprise and any enterprises dependent on the governing enterprise, other companies or enterprises, which directly or indirectly have obtained a significant share in the share capital of Mintos or in which Mintos has obtained direct or indirect participation, insofar as such information is necessary for the performance of functions delegated to them;</li><li>to outsourced service providers that Mintos has engaged in the provision of services arising from the Agreement, insofar as such information is necessary for the performance of functions delegated to them;</li><li>to personal data processors, the supervisor whereof is Mintos, insofar as such information is necessary for the performance of functions delegated to them;</li><li>upon handing over (transferring) a Claim to third parties;</li><li>to a third party, who is taking debt collection steps to recover debt from the User (such as debt collectors, lawyers, court bailiffs, insolvency administrators, etc.);</li><li>to Mintos legal, accounting, or auditing service providers, ensuring that the said persons have undertaken not to divulge such information.</li></ul><p>In the cases specified by law, Mintos is obligated to disclose the User’s personal data to state authorities.</p><p>Mintos does not disclose any personal data to state authorities or third parties without a legal basis. When delegating certain functions of Mintos to personal data processors, Mintos undertakes to guarantee appropriate technical and organisational security measures to ensure that the personal data processor upholds security standards that are not lower than the security standards set by Mintos.</p><p><strong>5. Where and how we store your information</strong></p><p>The data that we collect from you will be transferred to and stored at a destination inside the EEA. All information you provide to us is stored securely on our servers or servers of our partners. The information is encrypted.</p><p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Even though we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot fully guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us; therefore, transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p><p>The access to your personal information within Mintos is limited to those employees who have a good business reason to access or know this information. This is achieved through both technical solutions and physical access rights, as well as proper training and education of our employees who have built appropriate safeguards.</p><p><strong>6. Length of retention of information</strong></p><p>All User related information, including information that is stored in the Virtual Account and all communications with Mintos, is stored as evidence confirming the identity of the User, conclusion of the Agreement, transactions made and fulfilment of the Agreement and is kept until the fulfilment of the Agreement, the data is no longer necessary to provide Services, the data storage timeframe or limitation period for legal proceedings established by the laws and regulations of the Republic of Latvia expires, whichever occurs later. Below is a summary of some key considerations how long each piece of information is kept:</p><p>For accounting purposes, Mintos stores the User’s personal data in connection with the concluded and fulfilled Agreement for no less than 5 years after the conclusion of the Agreement.</p><p>For anti-money laundering and terrorist financing prevention purposes Mintos stores the User’s data in connection with verifying the identity of the User and the origin of the funds (including a copy of an identity document and all Communication Data) for 5 years after the conclusion of the Agreement.</p><p>The limitation period for legal proceedings is 10 years in accordance with the Civil law of the Republic of Latvia. Due to the fact that Transaction Data is interconnected with the provision of Services, there may be situations where the Transaction data is stored for a longer period of time in order to provide services to other users.</p><p>The Communication Data is retained for at least 1 (one) month up to 3 (three) years, depending on whether the Communication Data contains relevant information regarding the performance of the Agreement or the provision of Services (for example, the provisions of the Agreement are changed, or the Customer submits a complaint about the quality of Services).</p><p><strong>7.

This time period may be extended if the User’s request is complex or if due to the amount of received requests Mintos cannot prepare a reply within the previously set time limit. In this case Mintos informs the User about the extension of the time limit for preparing a reply to the User’s request and indicates the specific term for preparing a reply.</p><p>Should the User wish to exercise any of the rights listed below, the User can do so by submitting a request in one of the following ways:</p><ul><li>by sending an electronic request to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@mintos.com">support@mintos.com</a>;</li><li>by sending a signed request to Skanstes iela&nbsp;50, Riga LV-1013, Latvia.</li></ul><p>An authorised person can submit a request on behalf of the User, provided that a valid power of attorney is enclosed with the request.</p><p>Mintos reserves the right to request additional information from the User in order to verify the identity of the person, who has sent the request, and to protect the User’s data from being disclosed to unauthorised persons.</p><p>The User has the right to access the personal data free of charge.
