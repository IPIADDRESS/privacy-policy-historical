<strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
<p>
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world)
that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is
being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created,
we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
</p>
<strong>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Via Email</li>
</ul>
<strong>Can change your personal information:</strong>
<ul>
<li>By emailing us</li>
<li>By logging in to your account</li>
<li>By chatting with us or by sending us a support ticket</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>
<p>
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency,
enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
