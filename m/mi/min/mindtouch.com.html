<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Thank you for visiting one of MindTouch®, Inc.’s (“MindTouch”) Internet websites. This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout MindTouch, governing MindTouch’s use of information, including without limitation personally identifiable information, about users on www.mindtouch.com web site (the “Website”) and users of our cloud based services (“Services”).</p>
<h1>Safe Harbor Principles</h1>
<p>MindTouch, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “MindTouch,” “we,” “us” or “our”) complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland (the “Safe Harbor Principles”).&nbsp; MindTouch has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, and enforcement. &nbsp;If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Safe Harbor Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles shall govern. MindTouch’s Safe Harbor certification can be found at <a title="U.S.-EU Safe Harbor List" href="https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx" target="_blank">https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx</a>. For more information about the Safe Harbor Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Website at <a title="Safe Harbor" href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>
<p>This privacy policy outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Safe Harbor Principles, including the types of information we gather, how we use it and the notice and choice affected individuals have regarding our use of and their ability to correct that information. This privacy policy applies to all personal information received by MindTouch whether in electronic, paper or verbal format.</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>“Personal Information” or “Information” means information that (1) is transferred from the EU to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.</p>
<p>“Sensitive Personal Information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.</p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>MindTouch shall inform an individual of the purpose for which it collects and uses the Personal Information and the types of non-agent third parties to which the MindTouch discloses or may disclose that Information. MindTouch shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to MindTouch, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before the MindTouch uses or discloses the Information for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected.</p>
<h3>Choice</h3>
<p>MindTouch will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Information is (1) to be disclosed to a third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, MindTouch will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt out) consent to the disclosure of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. MindTouch shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information.</p>
<h3>Onward Transfers</h3>
<p>Prior to disclosing Personal Information to a third party, MindTouch shall notify the individual of such disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure. MindTouch shall ensure that any third party for which Personal Information may be disclosed subscribes to the Safe Harbor Principles or are subject to law providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Safe Harbor Principles and agree in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection.</p>
<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>MindTouch shall take reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. MindTouch has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. MindTouch cannot guarantee the security of Information on or transmitted via the Internet.</p>
<h3>Data Integrity</h3>
<p>MindTouch shall only process Personal Information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, MindTouch shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.</p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>MindTouch shall allow an individual access to their Personal Information and allow the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>MindTouch uses a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this privacy policy and periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns using the contact information provided and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles. &nbsp;&nbsp;If a complaint or dispute cannot be resolved through our internal process, we agree to dispute resolution using BBB EU Safe Harbor Program MindTouch’s chosen third party resolution provider. &nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed MindTouch, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site at <a title="Safe Harbor Complaints" href="http://www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints" target="_blank">www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints</a>&nbsp;for more information and to file a complaint.</p>
<h3>Amendments</h3>
