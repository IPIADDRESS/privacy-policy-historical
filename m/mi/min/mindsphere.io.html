                        <p>Status: 02.02.2015</p>
                        <p>Protecting the security and privacy of your personal data is important to Siemens. Therefore, the Siemens company referred to under "Corporate Information" ("Siemens") operates its websites in compliance with applicable laws on data privacy protection and data security.<br>
                            In the following, we provide information on the kinds of data we collect on these Siemens websites, the purposes for which we use such data, and the parties with which we share such data, where applicable.</p>

                        <h3>Collected data and purpose of processing</h3>
                        <p>We employ cookies on these websites. You will find additional information on this subject in our Cookie Policy. This policy also tells you how to block the use of cookies and the use of data collected by cookies in anonymized or pseudonymized usage profiles.<br>
                            Accesses to our website are logged for the purpose of security analysis reports and to defend against cyber-attacks. With the exception of the IP address, no personal data is ever collected or used in this connection. IP addresses are analyzed only in the event of a cyber-attack. Log data is promptly deleted on a regular basis.<br>
                            In addition, we collect personal data (e.g., names, addresses, telephone numbers, or e-mail addresses) in connection with the operation of our websites only when you have voluntarily provided such data to us (e.g., through registration, contact inquiries, surveys, etc.) and when we are entitled to process or use such data by virtue of permission granted by you or on the basis of a statutory provision.<br>
                            As a general rule, we use such data only for the purpose for which you divulged the data to us, such as to answer your inquiries, process your orders, or grant you access to certain information or offerings.</p>

                        <h3>Sharing of data</h3>
                        <p>Insofar as you have provided your consent or when we are otherwise legally entitled to do so, we will share your personal data with subsidiaries of Siemens, where applicable, for the purposes indicated above.<br>
                            In connection with the operation of its website and the services provided by way of the website, Siemens works with service providers such as hosting or IT maintenance service providers, for example.<br>
                            These recipients may possibly be located in countries outside of the European Economic Area ("third countries"), in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data privacy protection as in your home country. In such cases, Siemens takes measures to ensure an appropriate level of data privacy protection. For example, we share your personal data with Siemens subsidiaries in third countries only if they have implemented our Binding Corporate Rules ("BCR") for the protection of personal data. You will find additional information on the Siemens BCR under "Downloads."<br>
                            Data is shared only in connection with and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We do not sell or otherwise market your personal data to third parties.</p>

                        <h3>Questions and comments; changes</h3>
                        <p>Siemens will respond to all legitimate requests for information and where applicable, to correct, amend, or delete your personal data. If you wish to make such a request or if you have questions or comments about this Data Privacy Policy, please click on "<a href="http://www.siemens.com/contact/en/corporate/general.php" target="_blank">Contact</a>" to send us your questions and suggestions.<br>
                            This Data Privacy Policy is updated from time to time. You will find the date of the last update at the top of this page.</p>

                            For example, cookies enable us to tailor a website to better match your interests or to store your password so that you do not have to re-enter it every time. As a general rule, we never collect personal data via cookies, unless you have given us your express permission to do so.<br>
                            If you do not want us to recognize your terminal device, please configure your Internet browser to erase all cookies from your device, to block all cookies or to receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You will find brief instructions on how to do this below.<br>
                            Please note that certain functions of our website may no longer work, or not correctly, without cookies.</p>

                        <h3>Types of cookies</h3>
                        <p>Cookies can be assigned to four categories, depending on their function and intended purpose: absolutely necessary cookies, performance cookies, functional cookies, and cookies for marketing purposes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Absolutely necessary cookies</strong><br>
                            are needed for you to navigate within Siemens websites and operate basic website functions, such as the issuance of anonymous Session IDs for bundling several related queries to a server.</p>
                        <p><strong>Performance cookies</strong><br>
                            collect information on the usage of our websites, including for example the Internet browsers and operating systems used, the domain name of the website which you previously visited, the number of visits, average duration of visit, and pages called up.<br>
                            These cookies do not store any information that would make it possible to personally identify the user. The information collected with the aid of these cookies is aggregated and is therefore anonymous. Performance cookies serve the purpose of improving the user friendliness of a website and therefore enhancing the user’s experience. You can block the use of such cookies by creating an exclusion cookie (see "managing cookies" below).</p>
                        <p><strong>Functional cookies</strong><br>
                            enable a website to store information the user has already entered (such as user ID, language selection, or the user’s location), in order to offer improved, personalized functions to the user. Functional cookies are also used to enable requested functions such as playing videos and to make a user’s decision to block or disable a certain function (e.g. web analysis) persistent ("opt-out cookies").</p>
                        <p><strong>Cookies for marketing purposes</strong><br>
                            are used to offer more relevant content to users, based on their specific interests. They are also used to limit the display frequency of an ad and to measure and control the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They register whether users have visited a website or not, and which contents were used. This information may possibly also be shared with third parties, such as advertisers, for example. These cookies are often linked to the functions of third-party websites. You can block the use of such cookies by creating an opt-out cookie (see "managing cookies" below).</p>

                        <p><strong>Adobe Media Optimizer</strong><br>
                            We sometimes run online advertisement campaigns that display advertisements ("ads") to you based on your likely interests. We may learn your likely interests based on your use of our websites and applications, or from other companies and websites that we work with to help us understand your likely interests. These types of ads are often called "online behavioral advertising." We use Adobe Media Optimizer ("AMO") to display our ads on websites across the Internet. For this purpose several cookies will be set in your browser allowing both AMO and so-called ad exchanges to recognize your terminal device based on anonymous identifiers and to thus show you ads tailored to your likely interests. Please click <a href="http://www.adobe.com/de/privacy/opt-out.html" target="_blank">here</a> to prevent AMO from aggregating and analyzing the data collected from your visit of this website (web viewing data) and serving you tailored ads shown on other websites based on your activity on our websites and online services. If you opt out, you may still see our ads on other companies’ websites, but they will not be specifically tailored to you based on your activity on our websites and online services. In addition you may also opt out from the collection of web viewing data for interest-based advertising by some or all of the companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance on the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice page</a>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Xaxis</strong><br>
                            We permit the company Xaxis (a division of GroupM Competence Center GmbH, Derendorfer Allee 10, 40476 Düsseldorf), to place cookies on our websites that collect information on usage-based online advertising; this is also known as "targeting."<br>
                            For this purpose, Xaxis collects and stores anonymized data on our website. The cookie stored on your computer collects information about your activities on the websites you have visited (e.g., surfing behavior, sub-pages visited, ad banners clicked, etc.). Based on this data, Xaxis generates profiles that do cannot be used for personal identification, meaning that you as the user cannot be personally identified; in particular, the IP address you use is not stored.<br>
                            Your computer is then identified for ad delivery purposes and assigned to a target group. This information makes it possible to display advertising that is more relevant to you on the websites of other providers.<br>
                            You will find additional information on the technology used on our website and on data privacy at the following link: <a href="http://www.xaxis.com/page/privacy-policy" target="_blank">http://www.xaxis.com/page/privacy-policy</a><br>

<p>1.1. Any use of this web site provided by Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and/or its affiliates ("Siemens"), "Siemens Web Site", is subject to these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use may be amended, modified or replaced by other terms and conditions, e.g . for the purchase of products and services.

<p>2.1. This Siemens Web Site contains specific information and software, as well as - as the case may be - related documentation, for viewing or downloading.<br>
2.2. Siemens may stop the operation of the Siemens Web Site in full or in part at any time. Due to the nature of the internet and computer systems, Siemens cannot accept any liability for the continuous availability of the Siemens Web Site.</p>

</h3><h3><strong>3. Registration, Password</strong></h3>
<p>3.1. Some pages of the Siemens Web Site may be password protected. In the interest of safety and security of the business transactions, only registered Users may access said pages. Siemens reserves the right to deny registration to any User. Siemens particularly reserves the right to determine certain sites, which were previously freely accessible, subject to registration.
