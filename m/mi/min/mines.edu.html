<p align="left"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Commitment to Individual Privacy</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Colorado 
  School of Mines (CSM) supports the protection of individual privacy. We are 
  committed to ensuring the confidentiality of personally identifiable information 
  provided to us by our employees, students or visitors. However, because CSM 
  is a public institution, some information collected, including information gathered 
  from the CSM web site, may be subject to the Colorado Public (Open) Records 
  Act (Colorado Revised Statutes §24-72-101, <i>et seq</i>.). Thus, in some cases, 
  we may be compelled by law to release such information, including information 
  gathered from our web servers.&nbsp; This may include server log information, e-mail 
  messages sent to an individual identified on the web site, and information collected 
  from web-based forms. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Colorado Public (Open) Records Act </span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The 
  State of Colorado requires that all public records be open for inspection by 
  any person at reasonable times, except as otherwise provided by law. Under the 
  Colorado Public (Open) Records Act, all records made or maintained by a state 
  institution such as CSM are “public,” regardless of the format or medium of 
  such records. Certain personal information may be protected by state and federal 
  law. However, all information becomes a public record once it is provided and 
  may be subject to public inspection and copying, if not protected by federal 
  or state law.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">CSM also complies with the Family Educational Rights 
  and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. §1232g, which generally prohibits the release 
  of education records other than public directory information, without the student’s 
  permission.&nbsp; For more information about FERPA, please see the “Access to Student 
  Records” sections of the CSM Undergraduate and Graduate Bulletins. Copies of 
  the FERPA policy are available at CSM’s Registrar’s Office in the Student Center.&nbsp; 
  Students who wish to have their personally identifiable information removed 
  from the campus directory should notify the Registrar’s Office.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Information Collected</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It is CSM’s policy to collect the least 
  amount of personally identifiable information necessary to fulfill its required 
  duties and responsibilities, complete a particular transaction, deliver services, 
  or satisfy requirements mandated by state or federal law. This policy applies 
  to the collection of all personally identifiable information, regardless of 
  the source or medium.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">CSM 
  servers may collect information about user activities to facilitate computer 
  and network system management and related administrative functions. Collected 
  information may include, but is not restricted to the following:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;

    addresses</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">Other than the routine recording of 
  information in system and network activities logs, CSM</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> 
  does not generally collect personal information on individuals, unless such 
  individuals volunteer such information or<span style="color:red"> </span>voluntarily 
  participate in an activity that requires this information. For instance, CSM 
  web sites may request information such as name, address, e-mail address, and 
  telephone number to provide certain services.&nbsp; Any personally identifiable information 
  sent to us will be used only for the purpose indicated, and only that information 
  necessary to complete the transaction or deliver the requested service will 
  be collected.&nbsp; CSM does not sell email addresses or other personally identifiable 
  information to commercial enterprises for resale or marketing purposes. This 
  policy extends to the collection of all personally identifiable information, 
  regardless of the source or medium.</span><span style="font-size:9.5pt;font-family:Verdana"></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Cookies</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Some 
  of our web pages utilize "cookies." A "cookie" is a small 
  text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about web site 
  activity. Some cookies may serve to recall personal information previously indicated 
  by a web user. </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It is

  to block cookies with your browser, some CSM web sites may no longer work for

  makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the personal information retained about 
  individuals is accurate. Every faculty member, staff member and student has 
  the ability to check and update personal information such as his or her address, 
  phone number, etc. online at https://www.is.mines.edu/stuweb.</span><b><span style="font-family:Arial"></span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">CSM

  alteration or release of personal information stored in electronic form.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Sharing of Information and Third Party Services</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">CSM may share personal information with other parties 
  and gather information from other private data providers to facilitate its educational 
  and administrative operations. For example, CSM receives test scores from testing 
  agencies and sends transcripts to other schools.&nbsp; In addition, on CSM’s behalf, 
  third parties may provide certain services that involve the transfer of personally 
  identifiable information.&nbsp; CSM will take reasonable steps to ensure that these 
  third-party service providers are obligated to protect personal information 
  on our behalf.</span></p>
