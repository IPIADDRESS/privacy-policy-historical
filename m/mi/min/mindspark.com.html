<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em;">We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.&nbsp;For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.&nbsp;In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies</span>:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em;">A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes.&nbsp;Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies.&nbsp;A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website.&nbsp;A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em;">Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site.&nbsp;If accounts are offered, when you sign into your account, we may record your user or member ID and the name on your user or member account in the cookie file on your computer.&nbsp;We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in.&nbsp;For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies.&nbsp;In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier.&nbsp;We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em;">You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings.&nbsp;(Click “Help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.)&nbsp;If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em;">We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site.&nbsp;These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements.&nbsp;Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy.&nbsp;This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness.&nbsp;Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a style="color: #0272ba; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Web Beacons</span>:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em;">Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies.&nbsp;Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em;">Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns.&nbsp;We also may include web beacons in promotional [<em>or other</em>] e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website</p>
