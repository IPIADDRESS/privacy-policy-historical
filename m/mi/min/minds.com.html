	<font size="2">WEBB recognizes that our users have legitimate concerns about privacy.  It is important to us that our customers be able to retain their privacy when they are using the Internet.  This privacy policy, which is part of our User Agreement, sets forth our practices regarding the collection and use of “Personal Information”.  Personal Information is information that personally identifies you, including for example, your name, address and e-mail address.
<br><br>
	This policy addresses our activities from our servers.  Other sites, including those that we link to, may have their own policies, which we do not control and which are not addressed by this policy.

<br><br>
<b><u>Privacy Principles</u></b><br><br>

Because your privacy is important to us, WEBB sites displaying this privacy statement will operate by the following five principles.

<br><br><center><b>Principle 1</b></center><br><br>

WEBB sites will ask when they need information that personally identifies you or allows them to contact you (“Personal Information”).  Generally this information is requested when registering for a site, or when requesting a particular service.  When possible, WEBB sites will provide you with the means to make sure that your Personal Information is correct and current.

<br><br><center><b>Principle 2</b></center><br><br>

WEBB sites and their necessary service partners use your Personal Information to operate the sites and services and to inform you of new features, services, and products from WEBB and its affiliates.  We may also select other companies to send you information about their products or services (a “Secondary Use”).

<br><br><center><b>Principle 3</b></center><br><br>

If an WEBB site intends to use Personal Information for a Secondary Use, we will provide you with instructions on how to decline this service.  You may also stop the delivery of informational or promotional mail from WEBB sites by following the instructions on the mail.

 <br><br><center><b>Principle 4</b></center><br><br>

WEBB sites that are primarily directed at children will not use Personal Information for a Secondary Use without obtaining the consent of a parent or guardian.

<br><br><center><b>Principle 5</b></center><br><br>

WEBB sites may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with legal process served on WEBB or the site, or to protect the rights or property of WEBB, the site or the users of the site.
<br><br>

If at any time you believe that an WEBB site has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@webb.net">privacy@webb.net</a> and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.
