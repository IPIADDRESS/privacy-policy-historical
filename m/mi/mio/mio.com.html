Your computer provides this information automatically each time you log on, unless you've activated blocking technology available in some browsers. When you visit this Website or advertisements appearing thereon, or use one or more of this Website services, we may use an industry-wide technology called "cookies" which stores certain information on your computer and which will allow us to customize your experience to better match your interests and preferences, or to simply facilitate your signing in to use the services.
