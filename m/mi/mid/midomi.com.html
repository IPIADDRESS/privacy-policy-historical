      midomi allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, 
      to serve advertisements within the midomi Service. These third-party ad 
      servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, 
      the advertisements and links that appear on the midomi Service. They 
      automatically receive your IP Address when this happens. They may also use 
      other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to 
      measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their 
      advertising content.<br>

      midomi does not provide any personally identifiable information to these 
      third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as 
      part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability 
      to opt-in. However, please note that if an advertiser asks midomi to show an 
      advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to 
      that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit 
      the description of the audience they were trying to reach.<br>
      <br>
      You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad 
      servers or ad networks. midomi's Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we 
      cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites. <br>
