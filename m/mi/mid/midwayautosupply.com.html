<p>&nbsp;</p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Use of Cookies</span> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midway Auto Supply uses "cookies" to enable you to sign in to Midway Auto Supply services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midway Auto Supply uses cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to Midway Auto Supply.<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you sign in to a site using your Midway Auto Supply credentials, the Midway Auto Supply stores your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. The network also uses cookies to improve the sign in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Midway Auto Supply sites and services that depend on cookies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Use of Web Beacons</span> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midway Auto Supply Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow Midway Auto Supply to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Midway Auto Supply may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or Midway Auto Supply Newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midway Auto Supply may also place Web beacons from third parties on our site in order to compile aggregated statistics and to help determine the effectiveness of our joint promotional or advertising campaigns. Midway Auto Supply prohibits Web beacons on our site from being used by third parties to access your personal information. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Use of Third Party Ad Networks</span> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on Midway Auto Supply Web pages are displayed by Midway Auto Supply. However, Midway Auto Supply allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on Midway Auto Supply Web pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Midway Auto Supply does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. </p>
