      <h2 align="left">General Information</h2>
      <p>When you visit our website, our Web server automatically 
        recognizes only the domain name of your Internet service provider, and 
        not your email address. However, we do collect your email address if you 
        communicate with us via email.</p>
      <p>We also collect aggregate information on what pages people 
        access or visit. This means we know how many people visited a specific 
        page, but not who they are.</p>
      <p>We may also collect information that you voluntarily give 
        us through online surveys, advertiser entries in the Birth Market, on-site 
        registrations, or other forms.</p>
      <p>The information we collect is used to improve the content 
        and organization of our website, and for internal review. We may also 
        use this information to contact you for various purposes.</p>
      <h2 align="left">Our Use of Email Addresses</h2>
      <p>If you subscribe to Midwifery Today E-News or to other Midwifery 
        Today email publications and/or email discussion lists, your email address 
        will be used only for that purpose, or to contact you personally in case 
        a problem arises. Your email address will not be sold, rented or otherwise 
        given out to third parties.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, subscribers to Midwifery Today email newsletters 
        may receive special editions with information about a birth-related product 
        or service that Midwifery Today believes would be of interest to you.</p>
      <h2 align="left">Our Use of Other Contact Information</h2>
      <p><b>Postal Address</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you give us your postal 
        address online or by email, phone, fax or postal mail, this information 
        will be entered into the Midwifery Today customer database. You may receive 
        periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services 
        or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please 
        let us know by contacting us by email, phone or letter, using the contact 
        information provided above.</p>
      <p>Your postal mailing address may be rented to companies that 
        Midwifery Today believes offer a product or service of interest to you. 
        If you do not want your postal address sold to third parties, please let 
        us know at the time you place your order. Otherwise, you may request to 
        have your name put on our do-not-share list by contacting us by email, 
        phone or letter. We will remove your name from the list we share with 
        other organizations.</p>
      <p><b>Phone Number</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; We may use your phone number 
        to contact you about orders you have placed. We also may phone you to 
        let you know about a new product or service we are offering, to let you 
        know about special offers, or to remind you that it's time to renew. If 
        you do not wish to receive such phone calls, please let us know by contacting 
        us by email, phone or letter. Please provide us with your name and phone 
        number. We will not sell or rent your phone number to third parties under 
        any circumstances.</p>

      <h2 align="left">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, 
        unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If 
        our information practices change we will post the policy changes to our 
        website to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability 
        to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information 
        is used, please check our Web site periodically.</p>
      <p>IMPORTANT: If you have requested that your name, contact 
        information and/or other information not be used for specific purposes, 
        this will be honored even if we change our policies. For example, if you've 
        asked to be put on the "do not send postal mail" list, changes in our 
        privacy policy will not affect your previous request.</p>
      <p>You may prevent your information from being used for purposes 
        other than those for which it was originally collected by contacting us 
        by email, phone or letter. At your request we will provide you with access 
        to all information (including proprietary information) that we maintain 
        about you. We also offer you the ability to have inaccuracies corrected 
        in contact information, financial information, unique identifiers, transaction 
        information, and in communications that you have directed to our site. 
        You may access this information and/or have this information corrected 
        by contacting us by email, phone or letter.</p>
