        Online Privacy Statement</b></font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><font size="3">Since 1902, Meredith Corporation has
        focused on providing our customers with products and
        services that distinguish themselves on the basis of
        quality, customer service and value. Our Online Privacy
        Policies are designed to help us serve our customers
        while meeting their privacy expectations.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">We are a member of the Direct Marketing
        Association (DMA) and Magazine Publishers of America
        (MPA) and support self-regulation by these industry
        associations. We believe this is the best way to maintain
        good customer service while addressing the privacy
        concerns of our customers. Also, we actively participate
        in the DMA Privacy Committee, the DMA Ethics Operating
        Committee, and the MPA New Media Committee. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Additionally, we fully support and use
        the DMA Mail and Telephone Preference Services through
        which individuals may restrict the release of their names
        for marketing purposes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">When you register with our sites, enter
        contests or purchase items online, you may request that
        we remove your name from our marketing lists by sending
        an email message indicating your wish to restrict offers
        made to you. We are in the process of providing an
        opt-out feature near those areas where visitors supply
        individual information. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Our Web sites automatically recognize
        some information about our visitors, including the
        company that provides their internet service. Our sites
        do not automatically recognize the name, address, e-mail
        address or similar information specific to an individual.
        Such identifying information is recorded only if you
        supply it to us via an e-mail, bulletin board message, or
        online form. Our "cookie" technology allows us
        to record how many times you visit our site and it helps
        us manage content. This information allows us to better
        serve visitors to the site and is not rented or sold to
        any other company. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">If you send a comment or request
        information from us via email, you will receive future</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">communication from us through email.
        People who do not wish to receive email messages from us
        may notify Meredith via email (</font><a href="mailto:mercirc@mdp.com"><font size="3">mercirc@mdp.com</font></a><font size="3">). </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">If you contact us to order product,
        comment or request information and provide us with your
        postal mailing address, you’ll be added to our
        database to receive future mailings.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Meredith occasionally makes the lists
        of postal addresses volunteered on its Web site available
        to other carefully screened associations or companies
        whose products or services we think you may find of
        interest. We pre-screen all use of our information to
        avoid inappropriate use for our customers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">If you do not wish to receive such
        mailings, please copy your mailing label address exactly
        (or clip it out) and send your request to our Circulation
        Department at 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, IA
