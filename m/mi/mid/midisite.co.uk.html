		<h4><a name="privacy"></a>Our Commitment To Privacy</h4>
		<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide 
		this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices 
		you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make 
		this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every 
		point where personally identifiable information may be requested. </p>
		<h4><a name="do"></a>The Information We Collect: </h4>
		<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on this website. 
		On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive 
		materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: 
		</p>
		<blockquote><p>Name<br>
		Address<br>
		Email address<br>
		Phone number<br>
		Credit/Debit Card Information<br>
		(etc.)</p></blockquote>
		<p>On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, 
		if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you 
		will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types 
		of personal information collected are: </p>
		<blockquote><p>Name<br>
		Address<br>
		Phone Number
		(etc.)</p></blockquote>
		<h4><a name="use"></a>The Way We Use Information:</h4>
		<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order 
		only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside 
		parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. </p>
		<p>We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order 
		only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information 
		with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 
		</p>
		<p>We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for 
		another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only 
		used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving 
		the gift. </p>
		<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses 
		are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 
		</p>
		<p>You can register with our website if you would like to receive our catalog 
		as well as updates on our new products and services. Information you submit 
		on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the 
		registration form. </p>
		<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website 
		and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that 
		X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y 
		number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but 
		we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 
		</p>
		<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information 
		provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without 
		also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such 
		unrelated uses. </p>
		<h4><a name="data"></a>Our Commitment To Data Security</h4>
		<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the 
		correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, 
		and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect 
		online. </p>
		<h4><a name="children"></a>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h4>
		<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that 
		reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those 
		we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured 
		to attract anyone under 13. </p>
		<h4><a name="correct"></a>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h4>
		<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect 
		online and maintain by <a href="/contact.html">calling us or sending 
		us an email</a>. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 
		</p>
		<p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information 
		by sending us a request that credibly shows error. </p>
		<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps 
		to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. </p>
		<h4><a name="contact"></a>How To Contact Us</h4>
		<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, 
		please <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a>.<br>
