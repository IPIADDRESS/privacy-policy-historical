	<h4><a name="privacy"></a>Our Commitment To Privacy</h4>
	<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide 
	this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices 
	you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make 
	this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every 
	point where personally identifiable information may be requested. </p>
	<h4><a name="do"></a>The Information We Collect: </h4>
	<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on this website. 
	On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive 
	materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: 
	</p>
	<blockquote><p>Name<br>
	Address<br>
	Email address<br>
	Phone number<br>
	Credit/Debit Card Information<br>
	(etc.)</p></blockquote>
	<p>On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, 
	if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you 
	will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types 
	of personal information collected are: </p>
	<blockquote><p>Name<br>
	Address<br>
	Phone Number
	(etc.)</p></blockquote>
	<h4><a name="use"></a>The Way We Use Information:</h4>
	<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order 
	only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside 
	parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. </p>
	<p>We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order 
	only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information 
	with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 
	</p>
	<p>We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for 
	another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only 
	used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving 
	the gift. </p>
	<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses 
	are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 
	</p>
	<p>You can register with our website if you would like to receive our catalog 
	as well as updates on our new products and services. Information you submit 
	on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the 
	registration form. </p>
	<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website 
	and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that 
	X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y 
	number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but 
	we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 
	</p>
	<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information 
	provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without 
	also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such 
	unrelated uses. </p>
	<h4><a name="data"></a>Our Commitment To Data Security</h4>
	<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the 
	correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, 
	and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect 
	online. </p>
	<h4><a name="children"></a>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h4>
	<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that 
	reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those 
	we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured 
	to attract anyone under 13. </p>
	<h4><a name="correct"></a>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h4>
	<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect 
	online and maintain by <a href="/contact.html">calling us or sending 
	us an email</a>. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 
	</p>
	<p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information 
	by sending us a request that credibly shows error. </p>
	<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps 
	to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. </p>
	<h4><a name="contact"></a>How To Contact Us</h4>
	<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, 
	please <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a>.<br>
