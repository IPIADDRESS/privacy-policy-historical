	  <br>
	  <h2 dir="ltr">Network Privacy Policy</h2>
	  Mistral Media's network targets ads to consumers who visit our publisher's websites. Mistral Media does not track or maintain personally identifiable information (“PII”) about consumers. We may obtain anonymous information like behavior of a particular user, for example, visiting a particular website, clicking on a particular ad, geographic data and browser type, etc. by using cookies, pixels and IP addresses.
	  <ul>
	    <li dir="ltr">
	      <p dir="ltr">A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows Mistral Media to identify your IP address. Mistral Media may use cookies to track individual responses or views of advertisements.</p>
        </li>
	    <li dir="ltr">
	      <p dir="ltr">Pixels can be placed on advertisers' pages in order to track when a sale is completed. This helps Mistral Media target future ad placements, but no PII is obtained.</p>
        </li>
	    <li dir="ltr">
	      <p dir="ltr">Mistral Media may use your IP address to better target ads. Unless you use a static IP address, an IP address relates to households or larger communities. Mistral Media uses IP addresses to track where clicks are coming from and helps us fight click fraud, but no PII is obtained.</p>
        </li>
	    <li dir="ltr">
	      <p dir="ltr">Information can be collected directly from Mistral Media advertisements or indirectly through Publishers that Mistral Media works with.</p>
        </li>
	    <li dir="ltr">
	      <p dir="ltr">Mistral Media may set a cookie on your computer or associate behavior with your Internet service provider's IP address when you click on an advertisement delivered on publisher websites. After a behavior is associated to a cookie or an IP address, Mistral Media may track how you interact with the advertisement and the publisher website.</p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 dir="ltr">Use of Information and Data</h2>
	  Mistral Media may share anonymous information about your behaviors with trusted publishers under confidentiality agreements. These publishers may use this information to better target advertisements to you. <br>
	  <p dir="ltr">Mistral Media stores anonymous information in a database. This database is password protected and secure. Mistral Media maintains the data in an encrypted form, so that even if the data is improperly accessed, it is less likely to be in an intelligible format. The data is encrypted and password protected and only accessed to resolve a legal or business issue. Mistral Media cannot guarantee that its security or privacy protection measures will prevent its computers from being illegally accessed and the data stolen.	  </p>
	  <h2 dir="ltr">Privacy Practices of Third Parties</h2>
	  <p>Publishers who place advertisements on the internet may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to collect information about you. Mistral Media does not control publishers' use of such technology and shall have no responsibility or liability for such use.</p>
