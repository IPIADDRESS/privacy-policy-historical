</p>
<p>
    This page tells you the legal terms and conditions (“Terms”) on which we sell any items on the Sites (“Items”) to you. Please note these Terms only apply to the purchase of Items on the Sites. Purchase of Missguided Items from any other source (including without limitations our Stores or third party stores and websites selling our items) (“Other Sources”), will be governed by the terms and conditions applicable at the relevant source. Please note that promotions and offers available for purchases on the Sites may not be available for purchases through the Stores and Other Sources and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
    Please read these Terms carefully and make sure that you understand them before ordering any Items from the Sites. Please note that before placing an order you will be asked to agree to these Terms. By placing an order on the Sites or purchasing Items from the Stores you confirm your acceptance of these Terms.
</p>
<p>
    You should print a copy of these Terms or save them to your computer for future reference.
</p>
<p>
    We amend these Terms from time to time. Every time you wish to order Items, please check these Terms to ensure you understand the terms which will apply at that time.
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right to amend these Terms from time to time. These Terms were most recently updated on 26 October 2016.
</p>

<h3>
    How the contract is formed between you and us on sites
</h3>
<p>
    Our shopping pages will guide you through the steps you need to take to place an order with us. Our order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order.
</p>
<p>
    Please take the time to check the details of your order at each page of the order process and before clicking “Confirm and Pay”, as you will not be able to make any changes to your order after this point.
</p>
<p>
    After you place an order by clicking “Confirm and Pay”, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order.  We then send you an email that confirms that the Items have been despatched (“Despatch Confirmation”).
</p>
<p>
    Please note that items are subject to availability. As there is a delay between the time when the order is placed and the time when the order is processed, the stock position relating to particular items may change.  If an Item becomes out of stock we will notify you as soon as possible and you will be refunded where we have already taken payment.
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right to refuse an order for example if the Item you have ordered is unavailable or out of stock, if we are unable to obtain authorisation of payment, if there is an error in the product information including price or promotion or if we suspect fraudulent activity.
</p>
<p>
    If we are unable to supply you with an Item in these circumstances we will inform you of this by e-mail. If you have already paid for the Items, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery costs charged as soon as possible.
</p>

    Items on the Sites
</h3>
<p>
    The images of the Items on the Sites are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer's display of the colours accurately reflect the colour of the Items. Your Items may vary slightly from those images.
</p>
<p>
    All sizes and measurements of Items are approximate, however we do make every effort to ensure they are accurate as possible.
</p>
<p>
    We take all reasonable care to ensure that all details, descriptions and prices of Items are as accurate as possible. We reserve the right to refuse orders where information about Items has been mis-published, including without limitation prices and promotions.
</p>
<p>
    All our Items are sold on the basis that they are suitable for domestic use only.  Please contact us for further information if you intend using any Items in a business or public environment.
</p>
<p>
    Please be aware that our Items are not aimed at persons aged under 16 so please take extra care when purchasing Items as gifts for persons under this age group.
</p>
<p>
    We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices of Items are correct at the time when the relevant information is entered onto the Sites.
</p>
<p>
    Prices for Items may change from time to time without notice.  However, these changes will not affect orders that have already been despatched.
</p>
<p>
    The price of an item includes VAT (or similar sales tax) (where applicable) at the prevailing rate for which we are responsible as a seller.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the prices listed on the Sites are only applicable for items purchased on the Sites and not through any other source.
</p>
<p>
    The price of an Item does not include delivery and returns charges. You will be provided with details of our delivery charges during the order process. You can also see our delivery options and charges

<p>
    Please note that whilst we take utmost care in ensuring the content on the Sites (including descriptions of the Items and associated services such as shipping, payment terms, offers and promotions and delivery timescales) are accurate the Sites may at times contain typographical errors or other errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current.  We therefore, reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information at any time without prior notice.  Where this affects an order that you have already placed we will notify you of the error if it will impact upon your order.  In this regard, we reserve the right not to fulfil any orders that you have placed based on information on the Sites that may contain errors or inaccuracies.

</p>
<p>
    We may undertake searches with credit reference agencies for the purposes of verifying your identity and the personal information you submit as part of an order. To do so the agencies may check your personal information against any particular information on any database (public or otherwise) to which they have access.  They may also use your details in the future to assist other companies for verification purposes.  We may also use your personal information for the purposes of prevention or detection of fraud.  By submitting your order you agree to this.
</p>
<p>
    All Items ordered remain our property until we receive full payment from you.

</p>
<p>
    We will update the Services from time to time, and may change the content at any time.

    Placing an order on sites

<p>
    When you go through the checkout process and place an Order with us on the Sites (even where you are a guest i.e. where you have not logged into a Missguided Account (“Guest”)) you will provided to us various information about you including your name, email address, payment address, delivery address and telephone number. You must ensure that the details you input are correct and personal to you (e.g. you must not use a generic email address (e.g. accounts@missguided.com) or an email address that is used by another person) to ensure the accuracy and security of your information and to ensure that we can tailor our services to you. We use the email addresses you have inputted as a Guest to link Orders to you so it is important that this email address is personal to you to ensure the security of your information and to ensure that our information about you is kept accurate and up to date.

</p>
<p>
    Where you are an Missguided Account holder and you proceed through the checkout without logging into your Missguided Account upon inputting of the email address (that you use to login to your Missguided Account) you will be prompted to login to your Missguided Account by being asked to input your password. If you input your password, you will be logged in and the relevant fields in the checkout process will be populated with your Personal Details. If you do not input your password, you will be treated as a Guest and will need to complete your information in the relevant fields of the checkout process.
</p>
<p>

Whichever payment option you choose, Klarna will use the personal information you have provided in order to process payment of the items you intend to purchase (where applicable, this include disclosing your data to card issuers, where you have selected to pay by card and PayPal where you have selected to pay by PayPal). For more information about your payment options when using the German Site see our Terms of Sale. For more information about the Klarna Facility see the Klarna Terms of Use
