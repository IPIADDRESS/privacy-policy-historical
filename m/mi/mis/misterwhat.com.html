<h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>

7.1 MISTERWHAT is not responsible for the contents or activities provided by the users and clients of the portal. This information cannot be attributed to the operator of www.misterwhat.com and it does not represent its views. The contents include links, profile information, reviews, comments, pictures and videos posted on the web pages of the portal.
<br><br>
7.2 MISTERWHAT holds as highly important that the service is reliable and the servers suffer as few interruptions as possible. Any interruption caused by maintenance or server failures cannot be excluded, and MISTERWHAT does not assume responsibility for any such interruption.
<br><br>
7.3 MISTERWHAT assumes no liability for damages arising from the use of the business directory by clients or users because in case of such free services in legal sense there is no service contract. Therefore there cannot be claims for loss of profits, third party claims for compensation or other direct or indirect damages resulting from interruptions or misuse of the service by its user(s).
<br><br>
<h3>8. Rights of public content</h3>

8.1 If the client or user publishes contents or files in publicly accessible areas, he gives MISTERWHAT the right to use these contents (in whole or in part) on a global level, to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish them, if this is done only for the sole purpose of presentation, distribution and promotion of the content in question.
<br><br>
8.2 This right is valid only for the period of publication made by the client or user. Clients can remove their publication from the portal at any time.
<br><br>
8.3 If the client or user does not have the right to publish a particular content, he must ensure that the content rights holder has agreed to the transfer of rights under the above provisions.
<br><br>
8.4 For current and future services to meet more precisely his requirements, the client accepts that a pseudonym may be requested and be used when he applies for services. The authenticated pseudonymous data, in accordance with the law, will not be merged with the data of the pseudonym holder. MISTERWHAT uses these protocols only for its own purposes and in the interest of its clients to develop new services. There will be no transfer of personal data to third parties.
<br><br>
<h3>9. Security of personal data processing</h3>

9.1 MISTERWHAT uses all the technical and organizational security measures to protect authentication information, passwords or any other data recorded for security purposes, from destruction, manipulation, loss, unauthorized access. The methods used to meet the protection requirements are in accordance with the generally accepted standards of this field.
<br><br>
<h3>10. Jurisdiction</h3>

10.1 The exclusive place for all the disputes concerning services provided by MISTERWHAT is Pavia, Italy. For all claims of any kind arising from or in connection with a situation under terms and conditions, the Italian legislation will be applied.
<br><br>
<h3>11. Severability</h3>

11.1 If some provisions of these Terms, in whole or in part, are no longer valid, or will lose their legal effect later, the validity of the Terms will not be affected more than that. Instead of the inefficient regulations the legal provisions will come in force automatically. The same applies in case of any possible omissions in the terms.
