Every now and again, we receive requests for information from government departments, the police and other enforcement agencies. If this happens, and there is a proper legal basis for providing your personal information, we will provide it to the organisation asking for it. 
When we use your information as described in section 2, this may occasionally involve sending your information outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Where we do this, we make sure that appropriate steps are taken to protect your personal information and your rights. By providing us with your personal information, you agree that we may transfer, store and process your information outside the EEA.
Our websites contain hyperlinks to websites that are owned and operated by other organisations. These websites have their own privacy and cookie policies, and we urge you to read them. They control how your personal information is used when you give it to these other organisations or they collect it with cookies. We do not approve any other websites and we are not responsible for any information, material, products or services that are on or accessible through those websites or for the privacy practices of websites run by other organisations. If you use these other websites you do it at your own risk.
A cookie is a piece of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. Cookies can help to display the information on a website in a way that matches your interests. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. We use two types of cookie on our websites.
The first type is a 'session-based' cookie. This means that it is only saved on your hard disk for the time you are using our website. On MisterWhat, this cookie helps the website to 'remember' that you are logged into the site. If you log in and then don't do anything for 20 minutes you will get a message telling you that your session has timed out and that you need to log in again. This is a security measure to help protect your information. Within MisterWhat.co.uk we use these cookies to store your locations during a search session. When you have registered on MisterWhat, we use them to let you access your address book. 
The second type of cookie we use stays on your hard disk for up to five years. This 'persistent' cookie helps us understand the number of different people coming to the site, rather than the total number of times the site is used. Without the persistent cookie, if you visited the site once each week for three weeks we would count you as three separate users. On MisterWhat.com, we use these cookies to manage the adverts we show to visitors and to make sure that each visitor doesn't see the same advert too often. We also use them for research surveys, to make sure you are not invited to fill in a questionnaire too often, or after you have already done so. 
We do not store any of your personal information in either type of cookie. We do not link cookies to information you have given us during registration. We only use cookies to help us make the services we offer better for all our users.
If you do not want a website to create a cookie on your computer, most web browsers provide the option to disable them. However, our website may not work properly if you reject our cookies.
A web beacon is a line of code that we have installed on some of our pages to help us learn more about how our visitors make use of the content and services that we offer, and to count how often people visit different areas of the website. A web beacon is invisible to you and doesn't affect the content you see.
We do not use web beacons to collect any personal information about you, but they allow us to build up general information about how people use our site. Certain pages on our websites may also contain web beacons put in place by our advertising agencies so that we can measure how useful our advertising on other websites is. Web beacon files let our agency recognise a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn means we can learn which adverts bring users to our websites. The web beacon only records a limited amount of information that includes the cookie number, the page ID and the time and date you accessed the page. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number or email address.
You have the right to ask us not to use your personal information for marketing purposes. We will usually tell you when we collect your personal details if we are planning to use them for marketing purposes or if we plan to pass them to any other organisation for marketing purposes. We may update this privacy policy from time to time so you may want to check it each time you give us personal information or look at or change your personal details on our websites. 
We last changed this privacy policy on 30 January 2009. 
<br><br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know your options in relation toÂ·not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">click here</a>.
