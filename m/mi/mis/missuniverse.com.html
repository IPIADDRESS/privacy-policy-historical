        The Miss Universe Organization takes your electronic privacy seriously. 
            <br>
            We do not share Personally Identifiable Information with anyone unless 
        we tell you otherwise when we collect the information.</b></p>
      <p>Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the Miss Universe 
        Organization privacy coordinator by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@MISSUSA.com">privacy@MISSUSA.com</a><br>
        You may also send inquiries by mail to: <br>
        <b>Privacy Coordinator<br>
        The Miss Universe Organization <br>
        1370 Avenue of the Americas<br>
        16th Floor New York, New York 10019 </b></p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Kinds of Information</b><br>
        There are two kinds of information Web sites can obtain about you: </p>
      <p><br>
        Aggregate Information: Aggregate Information is anonymous data that Web 
        sites use to diagnose problems on the sites' servers, administer the sites, 
        and to help improve the quality of the Web pages. It may be your domain 
        name (i.e. "XYZ.com") or your IP address. </p>
      <p><br>
        Personally Identifiable Information: Personally Identifiable Information 
        is any information that personally identifies you. It can be your first 
        and last name, your email address, your home address, or your telephone 
        number. Sometimes this personal information is needed when you order products 
        online, sign up with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or subscribe to 
        an email newsletter. Other times, Web sites collect this information to 
        help target advertising and marketing. </p>
      <p><br>
        We at The Miss Universe Organization collect certain Aggregate Information-such 
        as your IP address (a number that's automatically assigned to your computer 
        whenever you're surfing the Web), browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet 
        Explorer), and domain (e.g., "XYZ.com"). We do this in the background 
        so it does not interrupt your cruising speed. We use this information 
        to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our site, and 
        to gather broad demographic information. None of this information is connected 
        with Personally Identifiable Information. So, when you enter our site, 
        you are anonymous and will remain that way unless you choose otherwise. 
      </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Cookies</b><br>
        The Miss Universe Organization may uses cookies on this site to remember 
        your zip code so that you can maintain a customized view of MISSUSA.com 
        showing your city's The Miss Universe Organization-TV affiliate Web site. 
        We may also use cookies when we conduct polls, surveys, and contests to 
        limit multiple responses and registrations.</p>
      <p> <br>
        The Miss Universe Organization will never use cookies to retrieve information 
        from your computer that was not originally sent by us to you in a cookie. 
        The Miss Universe Organization does not use information transferred through 
        cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes.</p>
      <p><br>
        You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers and our vendors. 
        The Miss Universe Organization does not control these cookies, and these 
        cookies are not subject to the Miss Universe Organization privacy policy. 
        The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard 
        in the Internet industry.</p>
      <p><br>
        Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you 
        can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being 
        sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the 
        polls, surveys, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if 
        you do so. </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Surveys</b><br>
        Sometimes The Miss Universe Organization posts optional surveys in which 
        we ask for Personally Identifiable Information. Here are some ways we 
        might use that information: </p>
      <p><br>
        -&nbsp;To send you information about The Miss Universe Organization and 
        this Web site<br>
        -&nbsp;To give to our content partners, who may send you promotional material<br>
        -&nbsp;To give to our advertisers, who may send you information about 
        their products and services</p>
      <p>The choice is yours - you do not have to answer surveys. If you choose 
        to answer the survey, we will always tell you on the survey form how we 
        will use the Personally Identifiable Information. If we are asking for 
        optional information, we will mark it with an asterisk (*) so you know 
        you can skip it if you want. And on that same page we will give you a 
        way to "opt out" of being contacted by the Miss Universe Organization 
        and any third parties. </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Contests and Sweepstakes</b><br>
        From time to time The Miss Universe Organization runs contests and sweepstakes 
        in which we ask for Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, 
        email address or telephone number. That's so we can let you know if you 
        win. Sometimes we request additional Personally Identifiable Information 
        such as your age, gender, and income level. And once in a while - though 
        not often - we require this additional information in exchange for allowing 
        you to enter the contest. Here are some of the ways we might use the information 
        that we collect: </p>
      <p><br>
        -&nbsp;To notify you if you are a winner<br>
        -&nbsp;To send you information about The Miss Universe Organization and 
        this Web site<br>
        -&nbsp;To give to content partners, who may send you promotional email<br>
        -&nbsp;To give to advertisers, who may send you emails about their products 
        and services</p>
      <p><br>
        We may share Aggregate Information with our partners and advertisers. 
        We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with any third 
        party unless we tell you otherwise when asking for it. We will give you 
        a way to "opt out" of being contacted by The Miss Universe Organization 
        and any third parties.</p>
      <p><br>
        If you win one of our contests or sweepstakes, we will not publish your 
        name, hometown, or other Personally Identifiable Information on the site 
        unless you give us your permission.</p>
      <p> <br>
        <b>Opt Out</b><br>
        We've mentioned this phrase - opt out - several times already. Here is 
        how it works at The Miss Universe Organization: </p>
      <p><br>
        We do not share Personally Identifiable Information with anyone unless 
        we tell you otherwise when we collect the information. It's that simple.</p>
      <p><br>
        If we ask you for Personally Identifiable Information, we will tell you 
        if we intend to share it with others. We will provide you with a way to 
        tell us that you don't want us to share the information or if you don't 
        want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about products, 
        services, and offerings from The Miss Universe Organization and/or any 
        third parties. Let us know and we will use your name and address only 
        to tell you if you win a contest. </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>The Miss Universe Organization and NBC TV Affiliates</b></p>
      <p><br>
        The Miss Universe Organization has a unique relationship with some of 
        the NBC Television affiliates. If you are interested in local information, 
        we will give you the option to choose a local affiliate or enter a zip 
        code. We asked for this information so that your view of the site could 
        be "branded" to your local NBC Television affiliate, or to any 
        other NBC Television affiliate you choose. You'll see their logo at the 
        top of your screen. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Some of our affiliates provide their own content, such as local news 
        stories. This content may be mixed with the content The Miss Universe 
        Organization produces in New York. And some affiliates sell ads or run 
        contests that will appear on their branded sites only.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Miss Universe Organization is not responsible for content or contest 
        by our affiliates, nor for the use of any information that our affiliate 
        may collect. </p>
      <p><br>
        We use reasonable efforts to require that all content on our site conforms 
        to our privacy policy. But we do not control, and we are not responsible 
        for, the content or privacy policies of our affiliates.</p>
      <p><b>Links To Other Sites<br>
        </b><br>
        When you visit the Miss Universe Organization's Websites, you may be directed 
        to other sites outside our service. For example, if you click on a banner 
        advertisement, you will leave The Miss Universe Organization's websites. 
        This includes links to sites operated by advertisers, sponsors and partners 
        that may use the Miss Universe Organization's logo as part of an agreement 
        with the Miss Universe Organization. These other sites may send their 
        own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. These 
        other sites are not subject to the Miss Universe Organization privacy 
        policy and the Miss Universe Organization is not responsible for the privacy 
        policies for these other sites, nor for the use of any information that 
        these sites may collect.</p>
      <p> <b>The Miss Universe Organization Store<br>
        </b><br>
        The Miss Universe Organization Store uses an online, faxable order form 
        for users to buy The Miss Universe Organization products. Names, street 
        addresses, and financial information are required to complete these orders, 
        and may also be used to contact customers about their orders when necessary. 
        However, neither the Miss Universe Organization nor the The Miss Universe 
        Organization Store shares this information with third parties. </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Deleting or Modifying Your Information</b><br>
        <br>
        If you've given us Personally Identifiable Information in the past and 
        then have second thoughts or want to update it, here are your choices:<br>

      <p>Although it is not always possible to remove or modify information in 
        the databases, we will make reasonable efforts to do so. If you've given 
        us information for one of those third parties we mentioned above [remember, 
        we tell you that when we ask the questions] and we've already passed it 
        on, we cannot delete or change the information.</p>
      <p> <b>Security of Private Information</b><br>
        We would like to tell you that your information is as safe with us as 
        it is in your head, but, as hackers have proved worldwide, no computer 
        security system is entirely foolproof. The most any Web site can do is 
        make reasonable efforts, which is what we do at the Miss Universe Organization, 
        to protect your information from theft, misuse and alteration.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Any personal information you give us is kept in secure files. Access
