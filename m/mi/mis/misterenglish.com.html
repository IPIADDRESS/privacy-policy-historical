    <p class="bold">Long Version:</p>
    <p>We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially 
      when conducting business. <br>
      <br>

      or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not 
      limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, and 
      credit card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include 
      information that is collected anonymously (that is, without identification 
      of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified 
      individual.</p>
    <p class="bold">What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? </p>
    <p>We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors.

      inventory that the Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell.</p>
    <p class="bold">What organizations are collecting the information? </p>

      vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may 
      provide such services as credit, may collect this information from our Visitors 
      and Authorized Customers (e.g. when buying a Database from MisterEnglish 
      payment is made through PayPal.com or 2Checkout.com - since MisterEnglish 
      does NOT see nor store credit card numbers). We do not control how these 
      third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they 
      use personal information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers.
