              for our Site (i.e., referring

              you request pages on our Site,
              our servers automatically log
              your IP address. An IP address
              is a number that is automatically
              assigned to your computer whenever
              you are surfing the web. ATK
              may store some information
              on your computer in the form
              of a cookie or similar file
              to help us maintain and improve
              this Site in many ways. A cookie is
              a small amount of data that
              is transferred to your browser
              by a web server and can only
              be read by the server that
              gave it to you. It functions
              as your identification card,
              recording such things as Internet
              addresses, passwords, and preferences.
              It cannot be executed as code
              or deliver viruses. With most
              Internet browsers, you can
              erase cookies from your computer
              hard drive, block all cookies, or
              receive a warning before a cookie is
              stored. The Help portion
              of the toolbar on most browsers
              will tell you how to prevent
              your browser from accepting
              new cookies, how to have the
              browser notify you when you
              receive a new cookie, or how
              to disable cookies altogether.
              Please refer to your browser
              instructions to learn more
              about these functions. Enabling
              cookies allows you to take
              full advantage of all the features
              on the Site and we recommend
              that you leave them turned
              on. If you elect to block the
              cookies, we will not be able
              to provide you with a personalized
              experience on our Site. </span></p>
          <p><span class="bodytextblack">In

            recognize a unique identifier
            from a cookie placed on your
            hard drive by another website.
            These are used by ATK solely
            to gauge the success of our own
            advertising. For instance, we
            may use a tracer to determine
            whether you visit certain web
            pages where ATK may have placed
            a banner ad. We do not use tracers
            to gather information on your
            use of the Internet unrelated
            to ATK. Please note that ATK
            does not use tracers to identify
            your personal information, and
