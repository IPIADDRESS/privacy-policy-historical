<h3>Mt. Bachelor Privacy Policy</h3>
<p><strong>Our Commitment To Privacy </strong><br>
  Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide
    this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices
    you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make
    this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and we will
    update it immediately if our policies change.</p>
<p><strong>The Information We Collect: </strong><br>
  This notice applies to information you supply to Mt Bachelor, Inc.

collected may include:</p>
<p>Name <br>
  Address <br>
  Email address <br>
  Phone number <br>
  Credit/Debit Card Information <br>
  (etc.)</p>
<p>On some webpages, you can submit information about other people. For example,
  if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you
  will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types
  of personal information collected are:</p>
<p>Name <br>
  Address <br>
  Phone Number <br>
  (etc.)</p>
<p><strong>The Way We Use Information: </strong><br>
  We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only
    to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties
except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
<p>We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order
  only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information
  with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
<p>We may offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for
  another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only
  used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the
  gift.</p>
<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses
  are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
<p>You can register on our website if you would like to receive marketing collateral
  as well as updates regarding resort events, news, snow conditions or terrain
  park information. Information you submit on other pages of our website will
  not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.</p>
<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website
  and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that
  X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number
  of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would
  not disclose personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Finally, Mt Bachelor, Inc will never use, sell, rent or share the
  personally identifiable information provided to us to any third party for any
  reason, except for in certain special cases in which we may disclose your personally

  Inc's site users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We

  you of our compliance with the law, including without limitation a response
  to a law enforcement request or a valid subpoena.</p>
