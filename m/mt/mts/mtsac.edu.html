      <b><a name="what">What personal information does the 
      Mt. SAC site collect?</a></b> 
      <p>Mt. SAC does not collect personal information for advertising purposes.</p>
      <p>Some personal information may be gathered when you fill out and submit 
        online forms. This information might include but may not be limited to 
        your name, social security number, email address, zip code, telephone 
        number, birth date, gender, or ethnic background. However, this information 
        will not be distributed or shared with any third party unless directed 
        by court order. If you submit a form or send e-mail to Mt. SAC, we may 
        keep a record of that correspondence. Occasionally, Mt. SAC may ask web 
        site visitors to participate voluntarily in surveys that we use for research 
        purposes. If personal information is included in these surveys, a link

      <p><a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/cookie.htm" target="_top">Cookies</a> 
        are a small file located on the user's computer that provides the web 
        server with information about you to help customize the site for you. 
        Cookies can store and sometimes track information about you. A small amount 
        of data is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's 
        hard drive. When you return to a web site, the cookie informs the web 
        server who you are and what your preferences are and can then customize 
        your browsing experience for that specific web site.</p>
      <p>The Mt. SAC web server does collect <a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/term/i/ip_address.html">IP 
        addresses</a> for system administration purposes, to track system usage, 
        or for security purposes. These IP addresses are kept in a log file and

      <b><a name="share">Will Mt. SAC share my personal information?</a></b> 
      <p> As a rule, Mt. SAC will not disclose personal information unless we 
        have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe 
        in good faith that the law requires it. Mt. SAC does not sell or rent 
        your information to anyone. When we do collect personal information and 
        if you do not wish your personal information to be shared, you may have 
        the choice of not participating in a particular service or feature where 
        personal information is collected.</p>
      <p>Mt. SAC may disclose personal information in special cases when we have 
        reason to believe disclosing this information is necessary to identify, 
        contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating <a href="/college/iet/web_resources/webteam/web_site_standards.html">Mt. 
        SAC's Standards and Practices</a> or may be causing injury to or interference 
        with Mt. SAC's rights or property, other Mt. SAC users, or anyone else 
        who could be harmed by such activities. Mt. SAC may disclose or access 
        personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires 
        it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to 
        maintain, service, and improve our products and services.</p>
      <p>Mt. SAC also does not share, rent or sell your personal financial or 
        health-related information. If you use a Mt. SAC email account, <a href="/college/iet/web_resources/webteam/web_site_standards.html">Mt. 
        SAC's Standards and Practices</a> prohibit you from divulging your user 
        ID and password to anyone.</p>

      <p><b><a name="secure"></a>Is the Mt. SAC Web Site Secure?</b></p>
      <p>The Mt. SAC web site administrators go to great lengths to ensure the 
        web site is as secure as humanly possible. Along with software and hardware 
        security features, the web site also uses Verisign's Secure Socket Layer 
        128 bit encryption technology (the most secure and trusted encryption 
        technology available) to ensure your personal information is as safe and 
        secure from intrusion as possible.</p>
