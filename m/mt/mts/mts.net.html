<h2>The Privacy Code in Detail</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Other individuals within the Company may be delegated to act on behalf of the Privacy Officer or to take responsibility for the day-to-day collection and processing of personal information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Company is responsible for personal information in its possession or custody, including information that has been transferred to a third party for processing or other purposes related to the Company's business and operations. The Company shall use contractual or other means to provide a comparable level of protection while the information is in the possession of the third party. (See principle 7)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Company shall implement policies and procedures to give effect to the Company's Privacy Code, including:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>implementing procedures to protect personal information and to oversee the Company's compliance with the Privacy Code;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>establishing procedures to receive and respond to inquiries or complaints;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>training and communicating to employees about the Company's policies and practices; and</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>developing public information to explain the Company's policies and practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<br>
<br>
<h4>Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes for Collection of Personal Information</h4>

<p><em>The Company shall identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time the information is collected.</em></p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>The Company collects personal information only for the following purposes:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>to establish and maintain responsible commercial relations with customers and to provide ongoing service;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>to understand customer needs;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>to manage and develop the Company's business and operations, including personnel and employment matters; and</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>to meet legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Further references to "identified purposes" in this Privacy Code mean the purposes identified in this Principle 2.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Company shall specify orally, electronically or in writing the identified purposes to the customer or employee at or before the time personal information is collected. Upon request, persons collecting personal information shall explain these identified purposes or refer the individual to a designated person within the Company who shall explain the identified purposes.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Unless required by law, the Company shall not use or disclose for any new purpose personal information that has been collected without first identifying and documenting the new purpose and obtaining the consent of the customer or employee.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<br>
<br>
<h4>Principle 3 - Obtaining Consent for Collection, Use or Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>

<p><em>The knowledge and consent of a customer or employee are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate.</em></p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>In certain circumstances personal information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example, the Company may collect, use or disclose personal information without knowledge or consent if it is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way.</p>

<br>
<p>The Company may also collect, use and disclose personal information without knowledge or consent if :</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information, such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>there is an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened; or</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>disclosure is to a lawyer representing the Company, to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or otherwise required by law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>In obtaining consent, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that a customer or employee is advised of the identified purposes for which personal information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the customer or employee.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Generally, the Company shall seek consent to use and disclose personal information at the same time it collects the information. However, the Company may seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected, but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Company will require customers to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as a condition of the supply of a product or service only if such collection, use or disclosure is required to fulfill the identified purposes.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In determining the appropriate form of consent, the Company shall take into account the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of its customers and employees.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In general, the use of the Company's products and services by a customer, or the acceptance of employment or benefits by an employee, constitutes implied consent for the Company to collect, use and disclose personal information for all identified purposes.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A customer or employee may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Customers and employees may contact the Company for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing consent.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<br>

<p>The Company collects personal information primarily from its customers or employees.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Company may also collect personal information from other sources including credit bureaus, employers or personal references, or other third parties that represent that they have the right to disclose the information.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<br>
<br>
<h4>Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention of Personal Information</h4>

<p><em>The Company shall retain personal information only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.</em></p>

<ol type="1">

<p>In certain circumstances, personal information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. (See Principle 3.1)</p>
</li>

</li>

<li>
<p>The Company shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to personal information that is no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or required by law to be retained.

</ol>

<br>
<br>

</li>
</ol>

<br>
<br>

<p><em>The Company shall inform a customer or employee of the existence, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information upon request and shall give the individual access to that information, except in certain circumstances.

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Upon request, the Company shall afford customers and employees a reasonable opportunity to review the personal information in the individual's file. Personal information shall be provided in understandable form within a reasonable time and at a minimal or no cost to the individual.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In certain situations, the Company may not be able to provide access to all of the personal information it holds about a customer or employee. The Company shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>if doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual;</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>if the information is prohibitively costly to provide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Upon request, the Company shall provide an account of the use and disclosure of personal information and, where reasonably possible, shall state the source of the information. In providing an account of disclosure, the Company shall provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed personal information about the individual when it is not possible to provide an actual list.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In order to safeguard personal information, a customer or employee may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit the Company to account for the existence, use and disclosure of personal information and to authorize access to the individual's file. Any such information shall be used only for this purpose.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Company shall promptly correct or complete any personal information found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any unresolved differences as to accuracy or completeness shall be noted in the individual's file. Where appropriate, the Company shall transmit to third parties having access to the personal information in question any amended information or the existence of any unresolved differences.</p>

<li>
<p>A customer can obtain information or seek access to his or her individual files by contacting a customer service representative.</p>
