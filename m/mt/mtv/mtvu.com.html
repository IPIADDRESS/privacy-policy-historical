<p>When we use the term “<u>Personal Information</u>” we mean information that you provide us that<br>

information other than Personal Information that may be collected about you, including, but not<br>
limited to, Device and advertising identifiers and information collected through cookies or other<br>
Tracking Technologies or Identifiers (as those terms are defined below).  Any Personal Information<br>
that is modified to remove your contact information and other information that identifies you or<br>

shall not be treated as Personal Information but shall be treated as Other Information after such<br>
modification.  (Personal Information and Other Information shall be referred to, together, as<br>
“<u>Information</u>“.)</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Information We Collect that You Provide Us.</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>3.1.1	User Registration; Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On; Single VII Sign-On.</strong><br>
If we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, there may be a few<br>
options for you to register: Site Registration (as described below), Third Party Social Media Network<br>

or other interactive service using one of those methods, Single VII Sign-On (as defined and described below)<br>
if offered by this Site.  In each case, you are required to either use a pre-existing user name and<br>
password (together, your “<u>User ID</u>“) or select a new User ID.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1.1.1 Site Registration.</strong><br>
For Site registration, you are required to select a User ID and may be required to also provide other<br>
Information, such as your email address and date of birth.  Additional Information may be requested<br>
and/or required during the registration process.  After you have registered for the Site under Site<br>

interactive services across Devices (such as when you login) and permit you to use Single VII Sign-On<br>
(as described below) to register for and login on such other websites, applications or other<br>
interactive services, but please note that other VII websites, applications or other interactive<br>
services may set additional or different requirements for membership, such as minimum age.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1.1.2	Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On.</strong><br>
We may provide you with the ability to sign on to the Site by using third party social media network<br>
credentials (“<u>SMN</u>“).  If you choose to sign-in through an SMN, you may be required to provide us with<br>
all or some of the Information required in the Site’s registration form and your use of the Site shall<br>
be governed by the applicable SMN’s privacy policy and user agreements as well as this Privacy Policy<br>
and the Site’s <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Please note that the<br>
SMN may set additional or different requirements for membership than those set for the Site, such as<br>
minimum age.  We, and VII, are not responsible for the use of any such SMN, or for the accuracy, use<br>
or misuse of any information that you may disclose to or receive from an SMN or other third party in<br>
connection with such use.  If you use an SMN to sign-in, we may receive certain information from such<br>
SMN and our use of your Information we receive from any SMN is governed by the relevant policies of<br>
any such SMN and any permissions you give us regarding your Information, including, but not limited to,<br>
those set forth in this Privacy Policy.  If you have questions about whether a particular feature,<br>
function or service of the Site is powered by a third party, you may contact us with your question as<br>
provided in <u>Section 12.2</u> (Questions) below.
</p>
<p>
After you have registered for the Site through SMN, we may recognize you when you visit certain other<br>
VII websites, applications or other interactive services and permit you to use Single VII Sign-On<br>

from such other VII websites, applications or other interactive services to register for and log into<br>
this Site (“<u>Single VII Sign-On</u>“), but please note that this Site may set additional or different<br>
requirements for membership, such as minimum age, than those requirements set by other VII websites,<br>
applications or other interactive services.
</p>
<p>
Also note that, for your online privacy and security, if other people have access to your Device,<br>
we recommend you log out of your account after visiting any of the websites, applications or other<br>
interactive services that are associated with your account.

<strong>3.1.2 In Connection with Certain Features and Functions.</strong><br>
We may also provide you with access to certain features or functions that we may offer on the Site,<br>
such as the option to participate in commenting, shopping and member profile pages.  To sign up for<br>
or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain<br>
Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions.<br>
For example, if we offer e-Commerce services on this Site, if you order any of our goods or services<br>
through such services, in addition to your name and contact information, we (or our operational service<br>
providers that we use to provide the e-Commerce service) may also collect and/or maintain your billing<br>
address, shipping address, selections, credit card or other payment instrument information, order number<br>
and information about your computer’s internet address and website which may have referred or directed<br>
you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL).
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Site may also provide features, functions and/or services powered by an SMN or other third<br>
party.  For example, Information may be disclosed to an SMN through plug-ins offered by such SMN (such<br>
as Likes, Shares or commenting).  Please take care when using any SMN or other third party service and<br>
familiarize yourself with the SMN’s or other third party’s policies and agreements, if any, that govern<br>
such use. </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1.3	In Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.</strong><br>
There may be a separate registration process to enter Promotions (as defined in the Site’s<br>

which may require the submission of&nbsp;all or some of the following: your first and last name, street<br>
address, city, state and zip code, email address, telephone number and date of birth.  Additional<br>
Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion.  The Promotion’s entry page and/or<br>
Rules shall provide the specific requirements.  You&nbsp;may also have the opportunity to opt-in to<br>
receive special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors or promotional<br>
partners (“<u>Advertisers</u>“) as a result of your use of the Site in connection with these Promotions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2 Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Site and/or third parties may use “cookies”, “web beacons”, Flash local shared objects and other<br>
similar tracking technologies (collectively, “<u>Tracking Technologies</u>“) to collect Other Information<br>
automatically as you browse the Site and the web.  “<u>Cookies</u>” are typically html or browser-based text<br>
or other files (and often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences<br>
and/or user activity.&nbsp;“<u>Web beacons</u>” (also known as image tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are<br>
small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising<br>
responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash local shared objects (“<u>LSOs</u>“) (sometimes known as Flash cookies and used if Adobe<br>
Flash is used) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.
</p>
<p>
These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional Other Information regarding<br>
your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site’s webpages, type of browser use, type of<br>
operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences)<br>
or other websites, applications or interactive services.  Through these Tracking Technologies, we may<br>
collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites, applications or<br>
other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address (which is automatically assigned<br>
to any Device(s) and/or Device and Internet browser combination you use to access the Site) and/or set or<br>
access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform and/or Device-Internet browser<br>
combination you use to access the Site (“<u>Identifier</u>“).  For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric<br>
Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform,<br>
such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple.  Your Personal Information is not<br>
collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using<br>
Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your<br>
Single VII Sign-On ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by VII or<br>
third parties.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2.1	The Site’s Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.</strong>
</p>
<p>
By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and understand that you<br>
are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site and other websites,<br>
applications or interactive services through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking<br>
Technologies in the emails we send to you.  See <strong><u>Your Choices</u></strong> section below for more information on how<br>
you can withdraw your consent for certain purposes.
</p>
<p>
We use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in<br>
<a href="#fourtwo">Section 4.2 “Other Information Collected by Us”</a> under <strong>“<u>How Is Collected Information<br>
Used</u>“</strong> below.  For example, we use Tracking Technologies to enable Single VII Sign-On, to prevent you<br>
from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your<br>
experience on the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing and other content<br>
and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2.2	Third Parties’ Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.</strong>
</p>
<p>
This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management<br>
platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing<br>
analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, “<u>Third Party Service Providers</u>“) to, for<br>
example, facilitate personalized advertisements (“<u>Customized Advertising</u>“) and/or other content, serve<br>
advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on<br>
the Site.  Customized Advertising enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for<br>
products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Site and other websites,<br>
applications or other interactive services you have visited.
</p>
<p>
Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access<br>
their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see<br>
<strong>“<u>Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers</u>“</strong> section below and <strong>“<u>More<br>
Information on Managing Tracking Technologies</u>“</strong> section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have<br>
access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you<br>
use the Site.
</p>
<p>
We may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies.<br>
For example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising serving services such as controlling how often<br>
you see advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance<br>
of such Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify Tracking Technologies set by the Site.  See<br>
also Section 5.2.1 for more information on this Site’s use of Nielsen’s proprietary measurement software to collect<br>
and use video viewing metrics and other information.
</p>
<p>
Except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to<br>
Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other<br>
Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Customized<br>
Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as<br>
measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site.  For example, in order to<br>
analyze traffic on the Site, we may provide to our Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect<br>
about your interaction with the Site along with an Identifier so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide<br>
analytics services to the Site.

If your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be<br>
able to access controls to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Delete <u>existing browser cookies</u> through the “Internet Options”, “Settings”, Preferences”, “Options” or<br>
	similar menu selection in your browser’s menu or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature, which<br>
	means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in<br>
	the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disable <u>browser cookies</u> through the same browser controls which means that browser cookies shall not<br>
	be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted.  Additional information on enabling<br>
	or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support<br>
	feature.  (See the “help” section of your browser for more information.)  Disabling may sometimes be referred<br>
	to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices.  If you<br>
	delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser<br>
	cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other<br>
	non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set.  (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.)  This may be<br>
	available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site.  Additional information on<br>
	warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser’s support<br>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The above options may cover browser cookies set by the Site, browser cookies not set by the Site<br>
(sometimes called third party cookies) and/or both types of browser cookies.  <strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT<br>
CONTROL AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS.  ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT<br>
THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM DO NOT TRACK OPTIONS THAT MAY ALSO BE OFFERED BY CERTAIN BROWSERS.<br>
</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>Many tools discussed above are “Internet browser cookie based”</u>.</strong>  This means that such<br>
tools rely on cookies to remember your choices.  For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the<br>
controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking<br>
Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described<br>
in our Ad Choices link, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through<br>
these mechanisms again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>The tools are “Internet browser and Device-specific” or “Device-specific”</u>.</strong>  Note that when<br>
you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific<br>
Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices.  This means, for example, that if you block or disable<br>
browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies<br>
when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9.  Further,<br>
you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below).<br>
See <a href="http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html">our Ad Choices link here</a> for more information about this Site<br>
and other options you may have regarding Customized Advertising across Devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.</u></strong><br>
Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable<br>
browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly<br>
(sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, <strong>if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to<br>
third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices<br>
to function.</strong> For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the<br>
Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network<br>
Advertising Initiative site may not function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>You shall still receive advertisements</u>.</strong>  Deleting or disabling Third Party Service<br>
Providers’, Advertisers’ or the Site’s Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online<br>
ads.  If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are<br>
automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no<br>
longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site<br>
and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable<br>
Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance<br>
of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes<br>
as described in the <strong>“<u><a href="#threetwo">Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</a></u>“</strong><br>
section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limitations Regarding Web Beacons.</strong> Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above<br>
opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled<br>
Tracking Technologies to track your activities.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies). Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as<br>
Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE<br>
CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER.</strong>  Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking<br>
Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options<br>
shall not remove Flash LSOs.&nbsp; For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer,<br>
please visit <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html</a>.<br>
If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services<br>
may not function properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies.</strong>  In addition to the above, if you delete or<br>
disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or<br>
functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, enabling Single VII<br>
Sign-On, saving your player settings or other purposes described in <a href="#fourtwo">“Other Information<br>
Collected By Us”</a> above, and some of our other services may not function properly.  In addition to the above,<br>
if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such<br>
Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Site may no longer be able to<br>
offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services<br>
or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile Platforms.</strong>  Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice<br>
regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be<br>
browser cookie based.  We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide<br>
to you regarding these Identifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Certain Identifiers.</strong>  Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked or disabled using<br>
the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies<br>
or other Tracking Technologies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</strong>  Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track”<br>
signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers<br>
incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be<br>
transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  There currently is disagreement, including among<br>
participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should<br>
do when they receive such signals.
</p>
<p>
We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and<br>
accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.  Instead, as described above, please see the link to the<br>
Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice<br>
regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other<br>
mechanisms described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.</p>
