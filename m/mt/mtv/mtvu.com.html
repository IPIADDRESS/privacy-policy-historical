<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MTVU may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from MTVU, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device.  Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for MTVU.  The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user’s telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name.  Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.  Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users that register for MTVU’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will<b> </b>be charged by the user’s wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from MTVU.  Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise.  <b>Under no circumstances will the Site, </b>MTVU<b>, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address. </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"><b>a.   Registration.  </b>To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for MTVU’s wireless marketing services.   Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of MTVU depending on the type of Promotion.  Premium rate services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>i.          Single Opt-in Method:</b>  In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.  The user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to MTVU will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to MTVU to send text messages to him or her. MTVU will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message.  The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from MTVU or by sending a text message to MTVU that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.  </p>
<p style="margin-left:.75in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ii.
