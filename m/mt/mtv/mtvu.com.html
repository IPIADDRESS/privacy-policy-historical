Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a users preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third partys interception of messages or a users Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Premium rate services will require the double opt-in (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>i. Single Opt-in Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The users voluntary submission of the designated word or code to MTVU will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to MTVU to send text messages to him or her. MTVU will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a Thank you message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from MTVU or by sending a text message to MTVU that says STOP, END, CANCEL, REMOVE, UNSUBSCRIBE or QUIT.</p>

Until the user responds to the Confirmation message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the Confirmation message at any time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">provided that</span> MTVU may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the users response to the Confirmation is only valid if the response is received while MTVU continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</span></p>
<p><b>iii. Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. MTVU will then send a Confirmation message to the users designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from MTVU to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<b> </b>The user must respond to the Confirmation message with a text message that states YES or Y that will indicate the users acceptance of MTVUs wireless marketing service.

<p style="margin-left: .5in; text-indent: -.25in;"><b><a name="5b"></a>b. Termination of Wireless Services by User.</b> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from MTVU by the following procedure:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by MTVU at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says STOP, END, CANCEL, REMOVE, UNSUBSCRIBE or QUIT. MTVU will terminate the users registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word ALL in the users termination request will cancel all of the users registered wireless services with MTVU. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of MTVU service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the users previous opt-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in; text-indent: -.25in;"><b>c.</b> <b>Termination of Wireless Services by </b>MTVU<b>.</b> A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that MTVU may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. MTVU may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in; text-indent: -.25in;"><b>d. Use of Information. </b>MTVU will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.

<p style="margin-left: .5in; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 12.0pt;">Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by clicking MY ACCOUNT on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your User ID and then clicking on “YOUR ACCOUNT INFO” to change, update, or delete your Personal Information. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID. See <a href="http://www.mtvu.com/about/privacy_policy/#9">Section 9</a> of the Terms of Use for how registered users of this Site who are California residents and are under 18 years of age may request removal of content or Information in Postings.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt;">You may also exercise certain privacy settings options by, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, clicking Profile or your display name at the top of the Site, selecting Edit Profile or Manage Account and selecting the Privacy tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt;">Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the users request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.<b> </b></p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt;">If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;"><a name="_DV_M309"></a><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: black;">Children or Ineligible Teenagers</span></span></b><b>.</b> If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) <span style="color: black;">or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ineligible Teenagers</span>), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the childs (or Ineligible Teenagers) parent or legal guardian (the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parent</span>) always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state). </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;">In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their childs or Ineligible Teenagers membership must use their childs or Ineligible Teenagers User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use Section of the <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.mtvu.com/about/terms_of_use/">Terms of Use Agreement</a></span></b> to terminate their childs or Ineligible Teenagers member; alternatively, Parents may send an email to the Sites Privacy Administrator and provide us with your childs or Ineligible Teenagers User ID and request to terminate your childs or Ineligible Teenagers account and registration.<a name="_DV_M314"></a> We will not allow direct access to a users account and Personal Information by any person without the users User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her childs or Ineligible Teenagers User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parents name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the childs or Ineligible Teenagers name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the childs or Ineligible Teenagers date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. MTVU will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her childs or Ineligible Teenagers account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. MTVU will then terminate the childs or Ineligible Teenagers account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>
