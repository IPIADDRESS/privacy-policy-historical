<p><a name="5"></a><strong>5. Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MTVU may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from MTVU, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for MTVU. The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user’s telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name. Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users that register for MTVU’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will<b> </b>be charged by the user’s wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from MTVU. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. <b>Under no circumstances will the Site, </b>MTVU<b>, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address. </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"><b>a. Registration. </b>To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for MTVU’s wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of MTVU depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>i. Single Opt-in Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to MTVU will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to MTVU to send text messages to him or her. MTVU will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from MTVU or by sending a text message to MTVU that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”. </p>
<p style="margin-left:.75in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ii. Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to MTVU’s sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by MTVU) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page. The user must also agree to the Site’s <span style="color:black">Privacy Policy and <b><u><a href="http://www.mtvu.com/about/terms_of_use/">Terms of Use Agreement</a></u></b> before the online registration process is completed. MTVU will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from MTVU to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<b> </b>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of MTVU’s wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time <u>provided that</u> MTVU may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while MTVU continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:.75in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>iii. Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. MTVU will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from MTVU to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<b> </b>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of MTVU’s wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time provided that MTVU may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while MTVU continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by MTVU at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”. MTVU will terminate the user’s registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word “ALL” in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered wireless services with MTVU. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of MTVU service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"><b>c.</b> <b>Termination of Wireless Services by </b>MTVU<b>.</b> A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that MTVU may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice.
