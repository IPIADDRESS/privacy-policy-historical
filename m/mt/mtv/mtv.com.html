<h3>MTV ONLINE'S PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

MTV ONLINE is committed to protecting our users privacy.  To that end, we offer this statement to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize personal information.
<p>	
MTV ONLINE defines personal information as information that includes a persons full name, their address, telephone number, date of birth and/or email address.
</p><p>	
MTV ONLINE can gather information on our users in three different ways: (1) cookie technology; (2) voluntary submissions; (3) sweepstakes or contests.  MTV ONLINE utilizes cookie technology to collect data regarding the number of visits a person has made to our site.  This data is stored in aggregate form and is in no way singled out in an individual file.  This information allows us to know what pages/sites are of interest to our users and what pages/sites may be of less interest.  Such information is utilized in revising the website to better meet our users needs.
</p><p>	
MTV ONLINE collects personally identifiable information from users when voluntarily submitted by a visitor.   We make it clear that a user must be 18 years or older before registering for one of our sweepstakes or contests and, should a user choose to do so, their enrollment information is erased from the sweepstakes database.
</p><p>	
MTV ONLINE does not sell or otherwise transfer any personally identifiable information of a user to a third party.
</p><p>	
MTV ONLINE encourages our users to be smart about choosing when, and to whom to release information online.
