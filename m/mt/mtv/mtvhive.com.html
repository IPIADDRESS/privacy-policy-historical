<p>This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Device</span>”) and whether you are accessing the Site as a registered user (if offered by the Site) or other user of the Site.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy&nbsp;governs only the&nbsp;Personal Information and Other Information (as those terms are defined below) collected by the Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner or by any other website offered by the Parent Companies and/or any subsidiaries and affiliates of the Parent Companies (collectively, “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Affiliates</span>”) or collected by any other company, unless specifically stated.&nbsp; We may from time to time, combine Information (as that term is defined below) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from our Parent Companies, Affiliates, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Site or any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered through the Site terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason.&nbsp; If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Site or any features, activities or services offered through the Site.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U.S. Governing Law; Safe Harbor. </strong></p>
<p>The Site is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S.&nbsp; We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>By participating in our Site activities, you certify that you meet the age and other eligibility requirements for this Site as set forth in our <a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/legal/termsofuse/"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use Agreement</span></strong></a>.&nbsp; If you do not meet such age and other eligibility requirements, please discontinue using the Site immediately as your continued use of the Site indicates that you are agreeing to the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">EEA</span>”) and Switzerland, for detailed information on our privacy policy and practices with respect to personal information transferred from the EEA and Switzerland, please see our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy located at <a href="http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/VIACOM-610657-v1-Safe_Harbor_Policy.pdf">http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/VIACOM-610657-v1-Safe_Harbor_Policy.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>If you are located outside of the U.S., the EEA and Switzerland, you use this Site at your own risk and initiative and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws.&nbsp; If this Site is part of the Flux platform, by using this Site, participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information and Other Information, you (i) consent to the transfer and/or processing of any Information you provide to the Site and to Flux, (ii) acknowledge that U.S. law may provide a lower standard of protection for personal data than the laws of your location and (iii) understand that this Site and Flux will collect, transfer, store, process and/or deal with your Information in accordance with<strong> </strong>this Privacy Policy and the <a href="http://community.mtvhive.com/Agreements.aspx"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flux Privacy Policy</span></strong></a> and U.S. law. Consequently, to the full extent permitted by law, you hereby waive any claims relating to the processing of your Personal Information or Other Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy that may arise under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection and Use of Personal Information and Other Information (Other than Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities). </strong></p>
<p>When we use the term “Personal Information” we mean information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, postal address, e-mail address or telephone number. &nbsp;&nbsp;When we use the term “Other Information”, we mean any information other than Personal Information that may be collected about you (Personal Information and Other Information, together, the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information</span>”).</p>
<p><strong>a. &nbsp; Information We Collect that You Provide Us.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>i.&nbsp; User Registration.</strong>&nbsp; To the extent we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, you are required to select a user name and password (together, your “User ID”) and may be required to also provide other Information, such as your email address and date of birth.&nbsp; Additional Information may be requested during the registration process (but not required).</p>
<p><strong>ii. In Connection with Certain Features and Functions. &nbsp;</strong>We may also provide you with access to certain features or functions that we may offer on the Site, such as the option to subscribe to a selection of free email newsletters and other periodic information, chat rooms, message boards, electronic mail services, messaging services, auctions, shopping, registration and member profile pages.&nbsp; To sign up for or participate in these<strong> </strong>features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions.&nbsp; For example, to sign up to receive email newsletters, you may be required to provide your email address, date of birth and zip code separate from any user registration.&nbsp; Further, for example, to the extent we offer such services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined in the <a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/legal/termsofuse/"><strong>Terms of Use Agreement</strong></a>), in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and may maintain your billing address, shipping address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number and information about your computer’s internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (<em>e.g.,</em> the referring URL).&nbsp; Your credit card or debit card number is collected via a secure transmission.</p>
<p><strong>iii. In Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.</strong>&nbsp; There may be a separate registration process to enter Promotions such as contests and sweepstakes which may require the submission of&nbsp;all or some of the following: your first and last name, street address, city, state and zip code, email address, telephone number and date of birth.&nbsp; Additional Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion, but submission of such Information may be optional.&nbsp; The Promotion’s entry page and/or Rules will provide the specific requirements.&nbsp; You&nbsp;may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertisers</span>”) as a result of your use of the Site in connection with many of these types of Promotions.</p>
<p><strong>b. &nbsp; </strong><strong>Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>“Cookies” (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity.&nbsp;“Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Site and/or third parties may use<strong> “</strong>cookies”, “web beacons” and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.<strong></strong></p>
<p>We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the&nbsp;Site&nbsp;and for other purposes described in the “Use of Information”, “<a href="#2b"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Information Collected by Us</span></strong></a>“<strong></strong> section below.&nbsp; These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site’s webpages, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences), may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites offered by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Site (“Identifier”).&nbsp; An Identifier is automatically assigned to any Device you use to access the Site.&nbsp; Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may associate Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies with Personal Information.</p>
<p>By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
<p>This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Advertising Service Providers</span>”) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Targeting Services</span>”).&nbsp; These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited.&nbsp; Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.</p>
<p>These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site. &nbsp;The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as Advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about you.</p>

<p><a name="2c"></a><strong>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities. </strong></p>
<p>The Site may provide users with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from the Site, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device.&nbsp; Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for the Site.&nbsp; The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user’s telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name.&nbsp; Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.&nbsp; Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>Users that register for the Site’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will<strong> </strong>be charged by the user’s wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from the Site.&nbsp; Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise.&nbsp; <strong>Under no circumstances will the Site its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address. </strong></p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration.&nbsp; </strong>To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for the Site’s wireless marketing services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of the Site depending on the type of Promotion.&nbsp; Premium rate services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p><strong>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single Opt-in Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.&nbsp; The user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to the Site will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to the Site to send text messages to him or her. The Site will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message.&nbsp; The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from the Site or by sending a text message to the Site that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.</p>
<p><strong>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process.&nbsp; The user must affirmatively consent to the Site’s sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by the Site) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page.&nbsp; The user must also agree to the Site’s Privacy Policy and <a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/legal/termsofuse/"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use Agreement</span></strong></a> before the online registration process is completed. The Site will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from the Site to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<strong> </strong>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of the Site’s wireless marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">provided that</span> the Site may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while the Site continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p><strong>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.&nbsp; The Site will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from the Site to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<strong> </strong>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of the Site’s wireless marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time provided that the Site may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while the Site continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p><a name="2e"></a><strong>b.&nbsp; Termination of Wireless Services by User.</strong>&nbsp; Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from the Site by the following procedure:</p>
<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by the Site at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.&nbsp; The Site will terminate the user’s registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.&nbsp; Any of these words followed by the word “ALL” in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered wireless services with the Site.&nbsp; If the user unsubscribes from one or all of the Site’s service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Termination of Wireless Services by </strong><strong>the Site.</strong>&nbsp; A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that the Site may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice.&nbsp; The Site may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p>
<p><strong>d.&nbsp; Use of Information.&nbsp; </strong>The Site will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use.&nbsp; We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.&nbsp; We will share Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates.</p>

<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.</strong></p>
<p>Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site, if you are a registered user of the Site, by clicking “MY ACCOUNT” on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your User ID and then clicking on “EDIT ACCOUNT” to change, update, or delete your Personal Information.&nbsp; However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information.&nbsp; We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.</p>
<p>You may also exercise certain privacy settings options by, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, clicking “Profile” or your display name at the top of the Site, selecting “Edit Profile” or “Manage Account” and selecting the “Privacy” tab.</p>
<p>Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children or Ineligible Teenagers</span></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ineligible Teenagers</span>”), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child’s (or Ineligible Teenager’s) parent or legal guardian (the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parent</span>”) always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message.&nbsp; The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).</p>
<p>In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership [must use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the “Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use” Section of the <a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/legal/termsofuse/"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use Agreement</span></strong></a>&nbsp; to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s member.&nbsp; We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID.&nbsp; If a Parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth.&nbsp; The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. The Site will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.&nbsp; The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.&nbsp; The Site will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection of Information.</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phishing</span></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials.&nbsp; “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers.&nbsp; <strong>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</strong>&nbsp; If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:email@address.com"><strong>privacy-admin@mtv.com</strong><strong></strong></a>, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.</p>
