Site is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or
older <b></b> who
reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions

This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are
set forth in our <b><a href="/legal/termsofuse/" class="red">Terms of Use Agreement</a></b>. Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall
have the meaning given in the Terms of Use Agreement. Both the
Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally binding on all
users.<b></b><br></p>

Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance
notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately
upon posting. Notice of material changes to either document will
be posted on the Site's homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing

disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important to us.

<p align="center"><b>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY
RIGHTS</b><br></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the State
of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to
request from companies conducting business in California a list of all
third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information
during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively,
the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either
an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "<u>unsubscribe</u>")
or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties
(such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes,
the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise
your disclosure choice options. <br><br>
MTV qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy
Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or
opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for
direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain
or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal
Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. <br><br>
If you are a California resident and request information about how to
exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request
to the following address with a preference on how our response to your
request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the
Privacy Administrator at <b><a href="mailto:feedback@mtvhive.com" class="red" target="_blank">feedback@mtvhive.com</a></b>, or you may contact us via regular mail at: <br><br><a name="0.2_OLE_LINK7"></a><a name="0.2_OLE_LINK8"></a>MTV

<p>The Site is designed and targeted to
U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the
laws of the U.S. We make no representation that this Site is operated
in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other
nations. By your participation in our Site activities, you certify that
you are at least 13<b></b>years of age or the required greater age
for certain features and a resident of the U.S. If you are located
in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you participate
in activities on this Site contrary to our policy that only U.S. residents
are eligible for certain activities, you do so at your own risk and
initiative, and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any
applicable local and national laws. By using this Site, participating
in any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information,
you (i) consent to the transfers and processing of any Personal Information
you provide to the Site and to Flux, (ii) acknowledge that U.S. law
provides a lower standard of protection for personal data than the laws
of various countries including, but not limited to, the European Union
and (iii) understand that this Site and Flux will deal with your personal
information in accordance with its <u>Privacy Policy</u> and U.S. law.
Consequently, you hereby<a name="0.2__DV_M68"></a> waive any claims that may arise
under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other
country or jurisdiction. All users of the Site are required to
provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when
prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in
good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy
Policy. 

</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Site indicates
your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure,
management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.
We may from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information
collected off-line to our online databases or store off-line information
in an electronic format. We may also combine Personal Information
we collect online with information available from other sources, including
information received from our Affiliates, marketing companies, or Advertisers
(as defined in the <b><a href="/legal/termsofuse/" class="red">Terms of Use Agreement</a></b>). This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information
and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of
the Site, even if your use of or participation in any particular service,
feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases,
is suspended or deactivated for any reason<a name="0.2__DV_M77"></a>. <br></p>
<p><b>1. Collection and Use of Personal

we mean information such as your first/middle initial or name and last
name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number,
instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL, date
of birth, e-mail address, gender, ethnicity and any other information
that would allow someone to identify you or contact you. Personal
Information also includes information about your personal preferences,
survey responses and your transactions or relationship with us, if you
have been a user of the Site or you have provided this type of information
to any of the MTVN family of companies. For example, to the extent
we offer such services, if you order any of our various Products (as
defined in the <b><a href="/legal/termsofuse/" class="red">Terms of Use Agreement</a></b>), in addition to your name and contact information, we will
also collect and maintain your billing address, shipping address, Product
selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information,
your order number, and information about your computer's internet address
and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (<i>e.g.,</i>

the referring URL). Your credit card or debit card number is classified
as "<u>Sensitive Personal Information</u>" and is collected via
a secure transmission. <br><br>
We collect Personal Information about you when you visit the Site and
input information, whether you are registering to use any services,
features or functions of the Site, participating in Promotions (as defined
in the <b><a href="/legal/termsofuse/" class="red">Terms of Use Agreement</a></b>), ordering or purchasing Products or in the course of any
other exchanges of information, transactions and activities. We
may use the information we obtain from you, including Personal Information,
to tailor your experience on the Site, to display content we think may
be of interest to you, or to let us customize what you see when you
visit the Site according to your preferences and personal characteristics. <br></p>

during the registration process (but not required), such as cable/satellite
provider, ethnic information, and annual income. We will allow
you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain
other Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information you have
given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select
a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to
us during registration and which is associated with your User ID<a name="0.2__DV_M95"></a>.
Among other things, these kinds of information help us securely identify
you as a registered or permitted user of the Site and our features and
functions. You will not be able to change your date of birth without
sufficient verification. <br></p>

<ul>
<p>All member benefits are free. <a name="0.2__DV_C131"></a>

at the time of registration or by responding to an offer or invitation
at a later date. You will also have the right to opt-out (unsubscribe)
or change your preferences at any time by logging in with your User
ID and changing the settings in your account. You may also opt-out
to particular email communications by responding to that email and using

or for security purposes), you will be required to provide us with certain

<p><b>c. Collection of Personal Information
in Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.</b>
To the extent we offer user registration on the Site, registration as

There may be a separate registration process which will require the
submission of all or some of the following: your first and last name,

depending on the specific Promotion, but submission of such information

with many of these types of Promotions. <br></p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p><b>d.<a name="use"></a> Use of Personal Information
in Connection with</b><b>Personalized</b><b>Advertising. </b>

We may use characteristics about you such as age, gender and/or ethnicity
for personalizing the online advertising from third parties that you
see when you visit the Site. This information may be used to send you
personalized advertising in combination with non-Personal Information
such as your website viewing, usage and purchasing history, which is
not part of your user profile. (For more information, please see
"Cookies and
Other Technology" section.)
You submit this Personal Information at the time of your registration;
it is part of your online profile and associated with your User ID.
We use third party ad servers to deliver personalized advertising to
you. However, neither these ad servers nor their advertisers will have
access to your individual online profile or your age, gender and ethnicity
information. These third parties only deliver designated advertising
to a targeted group of users which have been identified by the Site
based on certain characteristics and the Site instructs the third parties
to serve the ads but the identity or characteristics of an individual
user is unknown to the third parties. Age, gender and/or ethnicity is
only disclosed to third parties in the aggregate and cannot be used
to identify an individual user. By registering for the Site, you
have affirmatively consented to the use of such information for personalized
advertising. In order to withdraw your consent to use such information
for personalized advertising, you shall need to deactivate
your account on the Site by following the procedures set forth in <u>
Section 13</u> of the "Terms
of Use Agreement"
labeled "Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use". <br></p>

<p><b>2.
Wireless Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities: </b>
MTV may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for
special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered
via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones
and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent
to receive such information from MTV, either by registering on the Site
or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities
are provided by Affiliates for MTV. The Personal Information requested
as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone
number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested,
and the carrier's name. Optional information may be requested
for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods
or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.
Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address
or other information and, depending on the information collected, the
user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy
Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement. <br></p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions
are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's
interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using
a wireless communications device. <br></p>
<p>Users that register for MTV's wireless
marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will<b></b>
be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to
the user from MTV. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless
noted otherwise. <b>Under no circumstances will the Site,
MTV, its Parent Companies, or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless
email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that
has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email
address. </b><br></p>
<ul>
<p><b>a. Registration. </b>

To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two
registration methods provided for MTV's wireless marketing services.
Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in"
or the "double-opt-in" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of MTV
depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will
require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method. <br></p>
</ul>
<ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Single Opt-in Method:</b>
In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional
messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via
a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the
service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated
word or code to MTV will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively
granted permission to MTV to send text messages to him or her. MTV will
thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you"
message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using
the unsubscribe command in any text message from MTV or by sending a
text message to MTV that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE",
"UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". 

</li>
</ol>
</ul><br><ul>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li><b>Double Opt-in (Site/SMS)
Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet,
or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to
start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent
to MTV's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless
device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address,
only if requested by MTV) and by clicking the consent statement on the
Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's <b><u>Privacy Policy </u></b>and <b><u>Terms
of Use Agreement</u></b> before
the online registration process is completed. MTV will then send a "Confirmation"
message to the user's designated wireless device and will request
that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages
from MTV to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name
when appropriate).<b></b>The user must respond to the "Confirmation"
message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will
indicate the user's acceptance of MTV's wireless marketing service.
Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user
is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject
to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation"
message at any time <u>provided that</u> MTV may choose to terminate
offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response
to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received
while MTV continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.


</li>
</ol>
</ul><br><ul>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li><b>Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS)
Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet,
or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific
word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to
register for the service promoted. MTV will then send a "Confirmation"
message to the user's designated wireless device and will request
that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages
from MTV to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name
when appropriate).<b></b>The user must respond to the "Confirmation"
message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will
indicate the user's acceptance of MTV's wireless marketing service.
Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user
is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject
to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation"
message at any time provided that MTV may choose to terminate offering
wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to
the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while
MTV continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service. 

</li>
</ol>
</ul><br><ul>
<p><b>b. Termination of Wireless
Services by User.</b> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in
methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive
messages from MTV by the following procedure: <br></p>
</ul>
<ul>

<p>A user may cancel one or more services
via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe
mechanism provided by MTV at the time the message is sent, or by sending
a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE",
"UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". MTV will terminate the user's
registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.
Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination
request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services
with MTV. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of MTV service(s)
via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately
and will cancel the user's previous opt-in. <br></p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p><b>c.</b><b>Termination
of Wireless Services by MTV.</b> A user understands, acknowledges
and agrees that MTV may, in its sole discretion and without liability
to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing
service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance
notice. MTV may provide notice of terminations or changes in services
on this Site. <br></p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p><b>d. Use of Information. </b>
MTV will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional
Internet email address, or other Personal Information submitted for
its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide
the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other
use. We will not share such Personal Information with Advertisers
or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.
We will share such Personal Information with the operational service
providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you
and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates. 

</p>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p><b>3. Accuracy and Confidentiality: </b>
It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and
accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such
information up to date. <b>We cannot and will not be responsible
for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate,
truthful or complete</b><b>information or Personal Information or you
fail to update such information or Personal Information. </b></p>
<p><br>
You are solely
responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your User
ID, if applicable, and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities
and losses we incur or may suffer as a result of your failure to do
so. You, and not us, are solely responsible and liable for your activity,
behavior, use and conduct on the Site and for any use of the Site or
any other activity or conduct in connection with the Site by any others

to deliver personalized advertising messages to you based on your individual
interests, website viewing habits, purchasing history or preferences
("<u>Behavioral Personalized Advertising</u>") and/or your general
characteristics (such as age, gender and ethnicity) ("<u>Characteristics
Personalized Advertising</u>"). If you do not wish to receive
Behavioral Personalized Advertising, please see the opt-out instructions
below; if you do not wish to receive Characteristics Personalized Advertising,
please see the "<b><a class="red" href="#use">Use
of Personal Information in Connection with Personalized Advertising</a></b>" section (<u>Section 1(d)</u>) above for
how to withdraw your consent. <br></p>

<p align="justify">Opting out to an ad
server cookie does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.
Opting out means only that such ads will no longer be tailored to your
specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads
on this Site. <br></p>
<p align="justify">These third party Advertisers
and network ad servers may employ their own cookies and other technology
to provide personalized advertising and measure advertising effectiveness.
You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection,
use or disclosure of your Personal Information and website viewing/usage
information by third parties in connection with their advertisements,
promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet. The
use of cookies and similar technology by these third parties is within
their control and not ours. Even if we have a relationship with
the third party, we do not control those websites or their policies
and practices regarding your Personal Information. <b><u>This
Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information or website
viewing/usage information that a third party Advertiser or network ad
server may directly collect from you</u>. </b>
We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in
this regard. Use of Advertisers' or a network ad server's
tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies. <br></p>

<p align="justify"><b>[If there are multiple
ad servers, "Click here" takes you to a separate webpage that will
be a list of various ad servers that have a relationship with MTVN and/or
MTVN's current ad server. It will be one
"universal" opt-out page that will allow for a user to
"Select All" ad servers, or only select certain
ad servers but hit the submit button once to opt-out. Ideally,
if the ad server contracts directly with remnant ad-servers, the ad
server should remain the primary opt-out contact, meaning the user contacts
the ad server and the ad server contacts its remnant partner.
Otherwise, it will be impossible to identify all remnant ad servers
and provide the requisite opt-out for users.</b><br></p>

Certain Device Manufacturers:</b> Certain device manufacturers,

or entities that are not our Advertisers, except in the limited circumstances
listed below. As stated above, we will disclose Personal Information
related to or contained in a Posting in connection with the display

is intended to be disclosed. When we plan to disclose your Personal
Information to Advertisers, we ask for you to opt in to do so, in which

If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your
Personal Information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact
the Co-Branded Partner directly. The Co-Branded Partner will be

Registered or other users that upload videos may also be required to

<ul>
<p><b>b. Operational
Service Providers. </b>We also have the right to disclose your Personal
Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining
the Site's services, features, functions and operations. We
will refer to these third parties as "<u>operational service providers</u>". We use operational service providers
to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services,
features and functions we bring you and we request that our operational
service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal
Information or Sensitive Personal Information to third party marketers
that are not associated with the Site or the MTV Channel. Additionally,
such operational service providers are not permitted to use your Personal
Information or Sensitive Personal Information for their own marketing
or promotional purposes. <br></p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p><b>c. Other Non-Affiliated
Third Parties.</b> We will make your Personal Information and Sensitive
Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the
following limited circumstances:

</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>When we are compelled to
do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (<i>e.g.,</i>

to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); 

</li>
<li>If we believe your actions
violate any law, regulation, the <b><a class="red" href="/legal/termsofuse/">Terms
of Use Agreement</a></b>, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy,
or any of our other terms and conditions, Rules, offerings or any other
services, features or functions of the Site, or if you threaten the
rights, property or safety of the Site, the MTV Channel, the Parent
Companies, the Affiliates, or any of its or their operational service
providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any
other party; 

</li>
<li>If, in our sole discretion,
we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate
or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our business and
assets, to defend our interests and/or to comply with our legal and
regulatory obligations; or 

</li>
<li>In the event of a bankruptcy,
merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business
combination involving us, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates. 

</li>
</ul>
</ul><br><p><b>7. Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information:</b> We maintain reasonable standards of security
and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites, it is possible
that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions
or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct
financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always
secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site
by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the
proper handling of such information and any employee found violating
our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our
disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service
providers follow the same policy. <br></p>

<p><b>8. Phishing:</b> Phishing attacks

attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account
credentials. "Phishers" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead
consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into
divulging Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account
usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. <b>WE DO NOT
SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION
OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</b> If you receive such email communication,
please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator
at <b><a class="red" href="mailto:feedback@mtvhive.com" target="_blank">feedback@mtvhive.com</a></b> , and then immediately
delete the fraudulent email from your computer. <br></p><a name="review"></a><p><b>9. Review, Update or Delete Your
Personal Information: </b>Generally, you may review, update or
delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected
by the Site. You may also correct factual inaccuracies.
However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility,
such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified
with sufficient verification of the correct information. Deletion
or attempted deletion of certain Personal Information, such as your
user name, may not be permitted and/or may result in suspension of your
account or termination of any registration you may have made. To review,
update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information
collected by the Site, please click "MY ACCOUNT" on the homepage
to sign in to your Site account with your User ID. Then, click
on "YOUR ACCOUNT INFO" to change, update, or delete your Personal
Information.

<p>If you wish to review Personal Information
collected for Promotions such as contests and sweepstakes you will need
to contact the Site's Privacy Administrator via email with a request
at <b><a href="mailto:feedback@mtvhive.com" target="_blank" class="red">feedback@mtvhive.com</a></b><b>and be prepared to provide verification of
your identity. Personal Information collected for certain entries
are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and
will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is
a child under the age of 13 years old.

<p align="justify"><a name="0.2__DV_M309">Children
under the age of 13, or others who do not meet the greater age requirements
of certain features of this Site ("<u>Ineligible Teenagers</u>"),
that are unknowingly registered on the Site are in violation of the <b></b></a><b><a class="red" href="/legal/termsofuse/">Terms of Use Agreement</a></b>. Parents (including
legal guardians) of children or Ineligible Teenagers that registered
on the Site in violation of the Terms of Use Agreement who wish to terminate
their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their
child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to
the account, and select "EDIT ACCOUNT" or alternatively, you can
send us an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator and provide us
with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to
terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration.<a name="0.2__DV_M314"></a> 
We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information
by any person without the user's User ID (please see above for
how to change your preferences or the information associated with your
account). If a parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible
Teenager's User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to
the Privacy Administrator that includes the parent's name, address,
telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible
Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus
the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth. The parent
must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent
of the ineligible child or Ineligible Teenager. MTV will send a confirming
email to the parent via the email address provided to verify that the
parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's
account and registration. The parent must then confirm by sending
a reply email to the designated return address. MTV will then
terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will
notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via
email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person
making the request. <br></p>
<p align="justify">We reserve the right
to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including
without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or
functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity
of the person trying to access the user's account or any services,
features or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access
to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your
privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we
may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases,
we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided
and contact information for further inquiries. 

</p>
<p><br><b>10. Questions:</b> If you have questions about this Privacy Policy
or if you do not understand any information about how we collect, maintain,
use or share your Personal Information, you may contact us directly
by sending an email to <b><a class="red" href="mailto:feedback@mtvhive.com" target="_blank">feedback@mtvhive.com</a></b> . <br><br><b>11. Sole Statement:</b> This document is the sole statement of the
Site's Privacy Policy and no summary, restatement or other version
thereof, or other privacy statement or policy, in any form, including,
without limitation, machine-generated, is valid. <br><br>
