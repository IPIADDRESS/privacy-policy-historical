		<p align="justify"><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Your privacy on 
		  the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we gather certain types 
		  of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms

		  MTVindia.com gathers and tracks</b></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">MTVindia.com gathers 
		  two types of information about users: Data that users provide through optional, 
		  voluntary registrations for services like bulletin board, electronic newsletters, 
		  contests, and online surveys; and data that MTVindia.com gathers through aggregating 
		  tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites 
		  and click-through on our newsletters. Such information enables us to better 
		  tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand 
		  the demographics of our audience. Because MTVindia.com derives its revenue mainly 
		  from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to 
		  keeping our service free to users. The only situation in which MTVindia.com 
		  divulges information about an individual user to a third party is with certain 
		  contests and sweepstakes -- and then, only with the user's express consent. 
		  MTVindia.com gathers user information in the following processes:</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Optional registration 
		  <br>
		  </b></font><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Several 
		  MTVindia.com services offer free, voluntary registration to users. By registering, 
		  users can participate in contests and use services (such as message boards). 
		  They can also take advantage of personalization (the ability to select content 
		  according to a user-supplied profile). During registration, the user is required 
		  to supply information such as username, password, e-mail address, age, gender, 
		  and other related information. In addition, the user can opt to subscribe to 
		  electronic newsletters. Polling MTVindia.com also offers interactive polls to 
		  users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what 
		  the MTVindia.com audience thinks about various issues. MTVindia.com uses a system 
		  to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular 
		  question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Message boards/forums 
		  <br>
		  </b></font><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Users 
		  of the MTVindia.com message board must register for this service (free of charge) 
		  in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. 
		  During registration, the user is required to supply a username, password, and 
		  e-mail address.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Electronic 
		  newsletters <br>
		  </b></font><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">MTVindia.com 
		  offers a free electronic newsletter to users. MTV india.com gathers the e-mail 
		  addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from 
		  this mailing list through the subscription management pages. The instructions 
		  for unsubscribing are also clearly stated on every electronic newsletter sent 
		  out. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration. 
		  MTVindia.com delivers newsletters, marketing and product offerings via e-mail 
		  to only registered recipients from our subscription center. The e-mail tracking 
		  system recognizes the URL that was clicked, and records some information about 
		  you and your computer, such as the e-mail address that you provided to us, the 
		  browser, operating system, and IP address. MTVindia.com also uses the feature 
		  of your browser to set a "cookie" on your system. This allows us to measure 
		  and report the click-through rate on e-mail delivered and better determine future 
		  content. While aggregate counts of click-through behavior are provided to advertisers, 
		  an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. MTVindia.com 
		  does not target advertising against specific user information. MTVindia.com 
		  will not provide specific user information to any third party company.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>"E-mail this 
		  story to a friend" service </b><br>
		  <font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On MTVindia.com, a reader can choose to electronically forward a story or article 
		  to someone else by clicking the link that accompanies that story. The user must 
		  provide their e-mail address, as well as that of the recipient. This information 
		  is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient 
		  know who sent the story. The information is not used for any other purpose.

		<p align="justify"><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Occasionally,

		  our advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific 
		  individuals with any third party. Contests and sweepstakes</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#e0e3e9" face="Verdana, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">MTVindia.com offers 
		  contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. At 
		  a minimum, the required information includes name and e-mail address; in some 
		  cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of other 
		  personal data. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify 
		  the entrant's identity and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. There 
		  are two situations in which MTVindia.com will divulge this information to a 
		  third party -- provided the user gives express consent: (1) A user may expressly 
		  choose to receive additional information from the contest sponsor, in which 
		  case the user's personally identifiable information is divulged to the advertiser. 
		  (2) Some of the contests may be hosted on the MTVindia.com site but administered 
		  by the sponsor; in such cases, the information a user provides is passed on 
		  to the third party as long as that user gives express consent. Because the rules 
		  and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly 
		  posted during the event. All contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full 
		  accordance with Singapore law.</font></p>
