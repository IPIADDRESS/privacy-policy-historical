<strong><a id="USGoverningLaw" name="USGoverningLaw"></a>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>U.S. Governing Law; Safe Harbor.&nbsp;</strong> </strong>

The Site is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S.&nbsp; We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>By participating in our Site activities, you certify that you meet the age and other eligibility requirements for this Site as set forth in our&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.mtviggy.com/legal/mtv-iggy-terms-of-use/">Terms of Use Agreement</a></strong>.

If you do not meet such age and other eligibility requirements, please discontinue using the Site immediately as your continued use of the Site indicates that you are agreeing to the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">EEA</span>”) and Switzerland, for detailed information on our privacy policy and practices with respect to personal information transferred from the EEA and Switzerland, please see our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy located at <a href="http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/VIACOM-610657-v1-Safe_Harbor_Policy.pdf">http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/VIACOM-610657-v1-Safe_Harbor_Policy.pdf</a>.

<strong><a id="CollectionUsePersonalInformationOtherInformation" name="CollectionUsePersonalInformationOtherInformation"></a>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information and Other Information (Other than Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities).&nbsp;</strong> </strong>

When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, postal address, e-mail address or telephone number. &nbsp;&nbsp;When we use the term “Other Information,” we mean any information other than Personal Information that may be collected about you <strong>(Personal Information and Other Information, together, the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information</span>”). &nbsp;</strong>

<strong>a. &nbsp; Information We Collect that You Provide Us.</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>i.&nbsp; User Registration.</strong>&nbsp; To the extent we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, you are required to select a user name and password (together, your “User ID”) and may be required to also provide other Information, such as your email address and date of birth.&nbsp; Additional Information may be requested during the registration process (but not required).

<strong>ii. In Connection with Certain Features and Functions. &nbsp;</strong>We may also provide you with access to certain features or functions that we may offer on the Site, such as the option to subscribe to a selection of free email newsletters and other periodic information, chat rooms, message boards, electronic mail services, messaging services, auctions, shopping, registration and member profile pages.&nbsp; To sign up for or participate in these<strong> </strong>features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions.&nbsp; For example, to sign up to receive email newsletters, you may be required to provide your email address, date of birth and zip code separate from any user registration.&nbsp; Further, for example, to the extent we offer such services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined in the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.mtviggy.com/legal/mtv-iggy-terms-of-use/">Terms of Use Agreement</a></strong>),&nbsp;in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and may maintain your billing address, shipping address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number and information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (<em>e.g.,</em> the referring URL).&nbsp; Your credit card or debit card number is collected via a secure transmission.

&nbsp;

<strong>iii. In Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.</strong>&nbsp; There may be a separate registration process to enter Promotions such as contests and sweepstakes which may require the submission of&nbsp;all or some of the following: your first and last name, street address, city, state and zip code, email address, telephone number and date of birth.&nbsp; Additional Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion, but submission of such Information may be optional.&nbsp; The Promotion’s entry page and/or Rules will provide the specific requirements.&nbsp; You&nbsp;may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertisers</span>”) as a result of your use of the Site in connection with many of these types of Promotions.

<strong>b. &nbsp; </strong><strong><strong>Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> </strong>

"Cookies" (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity.&nbsp;“Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Site and/or third parties may use<strong> “</strong>cookies,” “web beacons” and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tracking Technologies</span>”) to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.

We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the&nbsp;Site&nbsp;and for other purposes described in the "Use of Information," <a href="otherinformationcollectedbyus">"<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Information Collected by Us</span></strong>"</a> section below.&nbsp; These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site’s webpages, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences), may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites offered by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Site (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Identifier</span>”).&nbsp; An Identifier is automatically assigned to any Device you use to access the Site.&nbsp; Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process, but we may associate Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies with Personal Information.

By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.

This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Advertising Service Providers</span>”) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Targeting Services</span>”).&nbsp; These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited.&nbsp; Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.

These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site.&nbsp; The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as Advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about you.

<strong>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of Information.</strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>iv.&nbsp; Disclosure to Operational Service Providers. </strong>We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information and Other Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site’s services, features, functions and operations.&nbsp; We will refer to these third parties as “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">operational service providers</span>.”&nbsp; We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we disclose your Information to operational service providers for the purpose of providing services to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong></strong>

</ul>
<strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Sharing and Disclosure of Other Information.</strong>&nbsp; We may share or otherwise disclose Other Information with third parties, but we do not disclose Personal Information to them except as described in this Privacy Policy.

<a id="ReviewingUpdatingDeletingCertainInformation" name="ReviewingUpdatingDeletingCertainInformation"></a><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.</strong>

Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site by, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, by clicking “Profile” or your display name at the top of the Site and then selecting “Edit Profile.”&nbsp; However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information.&nbsp; We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.

Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>

If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children or Ineligible Teenagers</span></strong><strong>.</strong>

If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ineligible Teenagers</span>”), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child’s (or Ineligible Teenager’s) parent or legal guardian (the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parent</span>”) always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message.&nbsp; The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).

In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership must use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the “Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use” Section of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.mtviggy.com/legal/mtv-iggy-terms-of-use/">Terms of Use Agreement</a></strong> to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s member; alternatively, Parents may send an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.&nbsp; We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID.&nbsp; If a Parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth.&nbsp; The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. MTV Iggy will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.&nbsp; The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.&nbsp; MTV Iggy will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.

&nbsp;

<strong><a id="ProtectionInformation" name="ProtectionInformation"></a>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection of Information.</strong>

While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information.&nbsp; However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission.&nbsp; We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site.&nbsp; We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes.&nbsp; We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phishing</span></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials.&nbsp; “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers.&nbsp; <strong>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</strong>&nbsp; If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at&nbsp;<strong><a href="mailto:privacy-admin@mtviggy.com">privacy-admin@mtviggy.com</a></strong>, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.

<strong><a id="CaliforniaPrivacyRights" name="CaliforniaPrivacyRights"></a>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your California Privacy Rights.&nbsp; </strong>

If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as “unsubscribe”) or opt-in for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes.&nbsp; Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.

<strong><a id="ChangesPrivacyPolicyNotice" name="ChangesPrivacyPolicyNotice"></a>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy and Notice. </strong>

We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by posting an updated Privacy Policy without advance notice to you.&nbsp; Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting.&nbsp; Notice of material changes will be posted on the Site’s homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion.&nbsp; However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.
