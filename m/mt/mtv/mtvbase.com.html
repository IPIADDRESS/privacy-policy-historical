				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="box-body">
				<h2>The privacy policy sets out how we use any personal information that you give us, such as your name, address, telephone number or email address.</h2>
				<br>
				<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
				<br>
				<h2>This document sets out the privacy policy of MTV Networks Europe, a partnership between two U.S. companies in the Viacom group of companies. This policy explains how MTV Networks Europe and its affiliated companies ("we", "us", "our" or "the MTV group" <a href="/mtvbaseafrica.com/terms/companies.jhtml">[click here for a full list of who we are]</a> use your personal information (meaning any information about you which is personally identifiable like your name, address, telephone number or email address and is generally referred to throughout this policy as "your information"). It applies to personal information collected from you.</h2>
				<br>
				<h2>HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
				<br>
				<h2>General</h2>
				<p>
				We collect your personal information in two ways:
				</p>
				<p>
				Firstly, when you give it to us (for example, when you provide information about yourself on an online form when participating in a competition or promotion). We use this information to process requests or orders, to enter you for competitions or promotions which you have indicated you wish to enter, to identify your personal preferences and to match your needs with relevant services or products.
				</p>
				<p>
				Secondly, when you register for our services using our registration services.  The information you provide to us via online registration is used to provide you with access via your user name and password to our website(s), to enable you to enter competitions on the website(s) using your user name and password, to post messages on the message board, to sign up to receive newsletters and to set up a personal profile on the website(s).
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
				<p>
				In addition and with your consent we (and if applicable, our partners or other trusted third parties) use your information for certain marketing, market research, analysis and related purposes. It is up to you how much or how little information you allow us to use for these purposes. Our on screen notices will ask for your explicit permission for such additional purposes. These purposes include:
				</p>
				<p>
				- to communicate with you from time to time by email and (where you provide us with those details either via the website(s) or elsewhere) by mobile (using SMS or, if your mobile device permits, MMS messages or similar technologies) and occasionally by post, with information, offers and other material which may interest you;
				</p>
				<p>
				- to make your information available from time to time to trusted partners and third parties, for the same purposes as above;
				</p>
				<p>
				- to conduct market research, for example by asking you to participate in a survey about topical issues conducted by us or trusted partners or third parties.  We will always try to tell you before you participate in the survey how any information you provide in the survey will be used; or
				</p>
				<p>
				- to enable us and third parties acting on our behalf to analyse your information, in a non-identifying form, (generally in the form of statistics), so that we can identify trends about usage of our website(s) or services and improve them.
				</p>
				<p>
				Additionally we reserve the right to access and disclose your personal information in order to comply with applicable laws, to comply with lawful requests from governments, law enforcement agencies or parties whose request we reasonably consider to be justified in connection with any allegations by any party about your abuse of our services, to operate our systems properly or to protect ourselves or our users.
				</p>
				<br>

				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
				<p>
				In the unlikely event that we sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of our business to another party, we reserve the right to transfer your information as part of any assets sold or disposed of.
