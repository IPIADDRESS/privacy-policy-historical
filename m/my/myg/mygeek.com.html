	<font color="Red"><b><u>Information Collected and How It's Used</u></b></font></p><p>
	
	<b>Your IP Address</b><br>
	An IP (Internet Protocol) address is automatically assigned to your computer every time you establish a connection 
	on the Internet. myGeek.com uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web 
	site. myGeek.com does not link your IP address to any identifiable personal information.</p><p>
	
	<b>Cookies</b><br>
	In computer language, a cookie is used to store data on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to store your 
	e-mail ID on your computer so that you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit myGeek.com. We never use 
	cookies to capture or contain personal information from your computer. The only personal information myGeek.com has 
	is what you give to us.</p><p>
	
	This policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers who may be on the myGeek.com Web site. myGeek.com 
	uses an outside ad company to display ads on our site, and these ads may contain cookies. While myGeek.com has 
	control over cookies placed on other parts of our Web site, our ad company collects cookies received with banner 
	ads, and we do not have access to their information.</p><p>
	
	<b>Your Account</b>
	When establishing a Guest account with myGeek.com you will be asked to submit a request with your e-mail address. We 
	will also ask you to provide us some demographics information including your home zip code and the country in which 
	the product will be sent. Providing such information will allow myGeek Sellers to provide you the most accurate 
	shipping information.</p><p>
	
	We use your e-mail address information to respond to your e-mail requests and to reach you if we need additional 
	information to complete your product request. We may also contact you about promotional or upcoming events, or to 
	take part in on-line focus groups or surveys. You may opt-out of these mailings as outlined below.</p><p>
	
	You control all your personal account information and you can update it at any time. Simply select the "my Account" 
	link located on the top of every screen, or contact 
	<a href="mailto:customerservice@myGeek.com">customerservice@myGeek.com</a> to update, change or remove your 
	information.</p><p>
	
	When establishing a Seller account with myGeek.com you will be asked to complete a Seller registration form which 
	includes the company name, contact name, street address, country, phone number, user name, and e-mail address. You 
	will also be asked if you would like to be notified once a day or each time a request is made in your selected 
	categories. Sellers may update their myGeek.com registration information at any time. Simply select the "Edit

	Any personal correspondence you send to us, including e-mail and letters, as well as correspondence from other 
	customers or third parties about your activities or postings pertaining to myGeek.com, and all entries made by you 
	onto our site may be collected and stored. Any notes, ideas, suggestions, or other material submitted by Guests 
	becomes the property of myGeek.com.</p><p>
	
	myGeek.com may run contests where we ask Guests for contact information such as e-mail or physical addresses. 
	myGeek.com may retain a third party company to oversee the collection and correct entry of Guest's contact

	information to fulfill the order. We encourage you to read the privacy policies located on the Seller's web site.</p><p>
