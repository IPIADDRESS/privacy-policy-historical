    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Your  privacy is important for us. This Policy applies to all pages under  myGoogly. Here we let you know what information we collect when you  use myGoogly. Why do we collect it, and how do we handle it. </p>
    <h2><a name="information" id="information"></a>Information what we collect and use</h2>
    <p>Why:  All we do is to better serve the userâ€™s experience. The cookies allow  your browser to remember where you moved and placed your search box and  the result list on your background. Collected data allows us to display  your browser's free area for the background picture during every new  page creation, you can trim it so it fits as good for you as possible.  We also need to collect basic data to be able to build toplist, and to  make our website searchable.</p>
    <p> We  offer services that do not require you to register for an account or  provide any personal information to us. In order to provide our full  range of services, we may collect the following types of information:  URL, IP address, browser type and language, screen resolution, and the  date and time of your request.</p>
    <p>Cookies - When  you visit myGoogly, we send one or more cookies - a small file  containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely  identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our  service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends. Most  browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your  browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being  sent. However, some features and services may not function properly if  your cookies are disabled (as detailed above).</p>
    <p>Log information  - When you use our services, our servers automatically record  information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These  may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol  address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your  request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
    <p>myGoogly  processes personal information on our servers in the European Union. In  some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your  own country. We may process personal information to provide our own  services.</p>
    <!--<h2>Choices for personal information </h2>      <p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. </p>      <p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. </p>      <p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case myGoogly may not be able to provide those services to you. </p>-->

    <h2>Information sharing </h2>
    <p>We  don't share personal information with other companies or individuals  outside of myGoogly. We do not rent, sell, or share any personal  information about you.</p>
    <!--<p>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of myGoogly, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. </p>-->
    <p>If  myGoogly becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of  sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before  personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different  privacy policy. </p>
    <p>We may share with third parties certain  pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of  users who searched for a particular term for example, or how many users  clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not  identify you individually. </p>
    <p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. </p>
    <h2>Information security </h2>
    <p>We  take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized  access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of  data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage  and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical  security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where  we store personal data. </p>
    <p>We restrict access to personal  information to people inside myGoogly, who need to know that  information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These  individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject  to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they  fail to meet these obligations. </p>
    <h2>Data integrity </h2>
    <p>We  process personal information only for the purposes for which it was  collected and in accordance with this Policy. We review our data  collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only  collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide  or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the  personal information we process is accurate and current. </p>
    <!--<h2>Accessing and updating personal information </h2>      <p>When you use myGoogly services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. </p>-->
    <h2>Changes to this policy </h2>
    <p>Please  note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not  reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and  we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any  Policy changes on this page.</p>
    <p>If you have any additional  questions or concerns about this Policy, please feel free to contact us  any time through this website.  </p>
