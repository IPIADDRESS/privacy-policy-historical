	<p>Mygazines takes your right to privacy seriously, and wants you to feel comfortable using our site. This 
	privacy policy deals with personally-identifiable information (referred to as "data" below) that may be collected 
	by this site. This policy does not apply to other entities that are not owned or controlled by the site editor, nor does it 
	apply to persons that are not employees or agents of the site editor, or that are not under the site editor's control. 
	Please take time to read this site's  <a href="terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
	
	<div id="content-subtitle">1. Collection of data</div>
	<p>Registration for an account on this site requires a valid e-mail address, a user name that has not been chosen already, 
	your full name, city, postal code and date of birth. 
	You are not required to provide any other information if you do not want to. Please be aware that the user name you choose, 
	the e-mail address you provide and any other information you enter may render you personally identifiable, and may possibly 
	be displayed on this web site intentionally (depending on choices you make in your account's privacy settings) or unintentionally 
	(subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third party). As on many web sites, the site editor may also automatically receive general 
	information that is contained in server log files,  such as your IP address, and cookie information.</p>

	
	<div id="content-subtitle">2. Use of data</div>
	<p>
	We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website, which is to enable users to discover and share information with one another. 
	This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. 
	We collect the following types of information from our Mygazines users:
	
	   </p><ul>
		   
		   	<li><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong>
		   		<ul>
		     	
		     	 We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but 
		     	 then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.
		          <li>Registration: In order for you to use Mygazines services, such as uploading, archiving &amp; sharing, you must complete a registration form. 
		          As part of this registration form, we require select personal information (including your full name, city, state and e-mail address).</li>

		          
		          <li>User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration, we enable you to provide additional information, 
		          such as a bio. In addition, you may choose to include a photo of yourself in your profile. As indicated below, 
		          in the section titled "Sharing Your Information", you can control how your information is displayed and used.</li>
		   		
		   		</ul>
		   	</li>
		   		
		   	<li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong>
		   		<ul>
		          	<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Mygazines and its authorized agents automatically receive and 
		          	record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, Mygazines cookie information, and the page you requested. 
		          	Mygazines uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.</li>
		          	
		          	<li>Mygazines may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes User Profile pages.</li>

		          	<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Mygazines will not be able to provide you with a personalized 
		          	experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
	<p></p>
	
	<div id="content-subtitle">3. Cookies</div>
 	<ul>
 		
 		<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser 
 		and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Mygazines cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information 
 		collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.
    	
    	</li><li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, 
    	how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies 
    	activated because cookies allow you to use some of Mygazines' coolest features.
	
	</li></ul>

	
	<div id="content-subtitle">4. Minors</div><p>
	
	You must be 13 years and older to register to use the Mygazines website. As a result, Mygazines does not specifically collect information about children. 
	If we learn that Mygazines has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. 
	We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission before using Mygazines or sending information about 
	themselves or anyone else over the Internet.
	
	</p><div id="content-subtitle">5. Editing or deleting your account information</div>
	<p>You are provided with the ability to edit the information stored for your user account information during registration, 
	by visiting 'my account' from the top of any page. You can request that your user account be removed by emailing <a href="mailto:support@mygazines.com">support@mygazines.com</a>
	
	</p><div id="content-subtitle">6. Changes to this privacy policy</div>
	<p>Changes may be made to this policy from time to time. You will be notified of substantial 
	changes to this policy either by through the posting of a prominent announcement on the site, and/or by a mail message sent to the 
	e-mail address you have provided, which is stored within your user settings.</p>
