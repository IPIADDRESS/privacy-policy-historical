TERMS OF SERVICE</h2><li>MyUS.com will provide the Member with a suite number at the Access USA facility in the United States at which the Member can have mail and/or merchandise delivered prior to export.<ul><li>MyUS.com's services consist of acting as an agent of the Member  for consolidation and export purposes by receiving the Member's  merchandise, which will be sorted, packed, and consolidated. At the  Member's direction, MyUS.com arranges for export to the Member's specified  local address by an unaffiliated service provider, which acts as the  freight forwarder and/or carrier for the shipment. MyUS.com does not act  as an indirect air carrier of property, but rather acts as an agent of the  shipper (<i>i.e</i>., Members). All packages received by MyUS.com will be  opened by representatives of the company. Members are responsible for all  import obligations in the country to which all mail (for a Premium+Mail Member only) and packages will be  sent. Members also authorize  MyUS.com as its agent to authorize freight forwarder and/or carriers to conduct  customs clearance and entry and to certify freight forwarder and/or  carriers as the consignee solely for the purpose of designating a customs  broker to perform customs clearance and entry.</li><li>Members accept that freight forwarders and/or carriers reserve the right to open and/or inspect every shipment tendered to forwarders and/or carriers on behalf of an Access USA Member.</li></ul></li><li>For Premium+Mail Members, MyUS.com also will receive the Member's mail (<i>i.e.</i>, letters, catalogs, and newspapers), MyUS.com cannot hold or store mail that will not fit into a 4 inch-tall mailbox. MyUS.com will notify the Member via e-mail once his/her mailbox is full, and the Member will have 5 days to either (a) request shipment of the mail or (b) request that MyUS.com discard the mail. If no reply is received from the Member, MyUS.com, in accordance with these terms, understands that the Member is directing MyUS.com to send the mail to the Member's address on record through an unaffiliated freight forwarder or carrier. Any charges generated directly from this activity, including taxes, customs duties, and service charges (including any charges that may be established in the future) will be the responsibility of the Member.</li><li>The Member authorizes MyUS.com to charge his/her payment method for all services and/or account activity with MyUS.com. Such charges may include but are not limited to membership dues, shipping and handling charges, return/reroute fees, storage charges, late charges, and any optional services. Failure to provide payment for services rendered at the time of service may result in late charges, stop shipment charges, suspension of service, cancellation of membership, and involuntary return or the discarding of any remaining merchandise.</li><li>If a Member's payment method is by credit card, and if such Member has an outstanding invoice or invoices, the Member authorizes MyUS.com to charge his/her credit card for the aggregate amount of such outstanding invoice or invoices in one or more credit card transactions. By way of example, if a Member has an outstanding invoice or invoices of $3,000 in the aggregate, the Company may either charge the Member's credit card (i) one time for $3,000, (ii) three times for $1,000 each or (iii) any other combination that in the aggregate equals $3,000.</li><li>Shipping costs are based on the weight and dimensions of your shipments. Shipping costs will be charged according to the actual weight or dimensional weight, whichever is greater</li><li>MyUS.com will allow active Premium and Premium+Mail Members to store their merchandise for up to 30 days at no charge. MyUS.com will allow active Basic Members to store their merchandise for up to 5 days at no charge. After 30 days for Premium and Premium+Mail Members, or after 5 days for Basic Members, the Member agrees to pay storage charges per box per day, consistent with MyUS.com's current schedule of fees</li><li>Prohibited or restricted merchandise is not storable and will be rejected, forfeited (and sold with the proceeds donated to charity), destroyed, or provided to government officials</li><li>Insurance costs for shipments of merchandise are based on the insured value. Each US $100 of insured value costs US $2. The insured value is subject to the terms and conditions of the particular carrier's airway bill(s). All claims are reviewed individually and any claim payment will be based on the declared value</li><li>Claims for lost or damaged merchandise must be filed within the published time limits of the particular carrier. Claims are considered filed when a fully completed claim form, photograph(s), and supporting documentation, including receipts, are received by MyUS.com.
