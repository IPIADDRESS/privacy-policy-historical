We may collect Personal information: (1) when you provide it to us directly, including through forms on the Website (including, for example, when you register for our service, purchase a membership, use our services, or otherwise); (2) when you send us an email or contact us using the Help page or Live Chat; and (3) from third-party service providers who assist us in collecting and analyzing Personal information.</p>

<p>The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Website also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers, and MyUS.com is not responsible for these providers' information policies.</p>

<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>

<p>Non-Personal Information. Because non-Personal information does not identify who you are, we may share or disclose such information without restriction. For example, we may share or disclose non-Personal information with our affiliates, suppliers, employees and agents, other businesses, and the government.</p>

<p>Personal Information. MyUS.com may share or disclose your Personal information:</p>

<ol>
	<li>To affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons who work on behalf of or with MyUS.com. MyUS.com may use third party service providers to host the Website or perform other Website functions, to help MyUS.com administer our business, or to communicate with you about offers or other information relevant to your relationship with MyUS.com. For example, we may provide your payment and financial information to third party service providers to process your payments and complete your transactions. All such third parties are subject to confidentiality obligations and are contractually obligated to maintain adequate security measures to protect your information;</li>
	<li>In response to subpoenas, to law enforcement or government officials for any reason, court orders, regulatory requests, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</li>
	<li>If MyUS.com believes it is necessary or appropriate to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law;</li>
	<li>To enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions, or other contracts with you or with third parties, including for billing and collection purposes;</li>
	<li>With a potential acquirer or buyer, if MyUS.com becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding;</li>
	<li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it;</li>
	<li>As otherwise may be disclosed at the point of collection; and</li>
	<li>For any other purpose with your consent.</li>
</ol>

<p>MyUS.com will not share or disclose your Personal information except in accordance with this Privacy Policy without providing you with notice.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Transfer of Personal Information</h2>

<p>We may transfer the Personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Notice and in accordance with applicable law. We use contractual protections for the transfer of Personal information among various jurisdictions (including, for example, the European Commission's standard contractual clauses).</p>
</section>

At the Member's direction, MyUS.com arranges for export to the Member's specified local address by an unaffiliated service provider, which acts as the freight forwarder and/or carrier for the shipment.

All packages received by MyUS.com will be opened by representatives of the company. Members are responsible for all import obligations in the country to which all mail (for a Premium+Mail Member only) and packages will be sent.

MyUS.com will notify the Member via e-mail once his/her mailbox is full, and the Member will have 5 days to either (a) request shipment of the mail or (b) request that MyUS.com discard the mail. If no reply is received from the Member, MyUS.com, in accordance with these terms, understands that the Member is directing MyUS.com to send the mail to the Member's address on record through an unaffiliated freight forwarder or carrier. Any charges generated directly from this activity, including taxes, customs duties, and service charges (including any charges that may be established in the future) will be the responsibility of the Member.</li><li>The Member authorizes MyUS.com to charge his/her payment method for all services and/or account activity with MyUS.com.
