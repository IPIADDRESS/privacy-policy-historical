                    <span class="boldblack">6. How much protected is my personal

                    To keep your personal financial information private is vital 
                    and important to us. As with all personal information, Mydearvalentine.com 
                    will never rent or sell your personal financial information. 
                    Your use of certain services or features, known to us, may 
                    help us to offer you better and more relevant content and 
                    advertisements. Yet as with all personally identifiable information, 
                    we do not make this available to any third parties without 
                    your permission. </p>
                  <p>Please note that there may be places on the Mydearvalentine.com
                    network of Web sites where you can transmit credit card information 
                    in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification 
                    purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit 
                    that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use best 
                    industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption technology. 
                    This sophisticated encryption process ensures that prying 
                    eyes are unable to decode your personal data when it travels 
                    from your computer to ours. </p>

                    <span class="boldblack">7. What security precautions are there 
                    to place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information? 
                    </span><br>
                    It may not be a norm but the fact remains that no data transmission 
                    over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure always. 
                    As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, 
                    Mydearvalentine.com cannot ensure or warrant the total security 
                    of any information you transmit to us or for our online products 
                    purchase or services, and you do so at your own risk. But 
                    once we receive your transmission, we strive and make our 
                    best effort to ensure its security on our systems. </p>

                    <span class="boldblack">8. What else should I know about my 
                    privacy?</span><br>
                    Do keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
                    information online - for example on message boards, through 
                    email, on mailing lists or in chat areas - that information 
                    can be seen and collected and used by others. In nutshell, 
                    if you post personal information online that is accessible 
                    to the other public, you may receive unsolicited messages 
                    from other parties in return. </p>
                  <p>Finally, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy 
                    of your passwords and/or any registration information. Please 
                    be careful and responsible on your own whenever you're online.

                    <span class="boldblack">9. Is there any children's privacy?</span><br>
                    Yes, the safety of children is very important to us. Children 
                    should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal 
                    information to Compare Infobase Pvt. Ltd, or to anyone online 
                    for that matter. Mydearvalentine.com does not share personal information 
                    about users under the age of 13 with third parties under any 
                    circumstances unless there is a special situation and such 
                    information is requested by law enforcing agency and we do 
                    not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, 
                    regardless of their age. In addition, Mydearvalentine.com will 
                    not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they 
                    are under the age of 14 without first obtaining their parents' 
                    permission. </p>
