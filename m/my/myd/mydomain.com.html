          </p><p>This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for MyDomain, 
            Inc. ("MyDomain") and how it treats the information that 
            MyDomain collects and receives, including information related to your 
            past use of MyDomain products and services. This policy does not apply 
            to the practices of companies that MyDomain does not own or control, 
            or to people that MyDomain does not employ or manage.</p>
          <p><br>
            1. The information collected by MyDomain.<br>
            2. How information collected by MyDomain is used. <br>
            3. Communications from MyDomain.<br>
            4. Underage customers.<br>
            5. Linking to third-party websites.<br>
            6. Our internal practices.<br>

            8. Final Statement</p>
          <p>1. The information collected by MyDomain. <br>
            MyDomain will not knowingly sell, share, or rent the information collected 
            on this site to others in ways different from what is disclosed in 
            this statement. MyDomain collects information from our users at several 
            different points on our website. </p>
          <p>1.1 Information that is automatically collected.</p>
          <p>We use IP addresses, with the help of a business partner, to analyze 
            trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad 
            demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked 
            to Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"). Personally 
            Identifiable Information refers to information such as an individual's 
            name, mailing address, phone number or email address.</p>
          <p>1.2 Information that is collected by cookies.</p>
          <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing 
            information about the user. Usage of a cookie is not directly linked 
            to any personally identifiable information while on our site. By setting 
            a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password 
            more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects 
            the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this 
            is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, 
            the user will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, 
            Contests or monthly Drawings that may take place. Cookies can also 
            enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance 
            the experience on our site. </p>
          <p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, 
            advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these 
            cookies. </p>
          <p>1.3 Information that is actively submitted to MyDomain.</p>
          <p>Registration. In order to register a domain name on this website, 
            a user must complete the registration process. During registration 
            a user is required to give their contact information (such as name 
            and email address). This information is used to contact the user to 
            fulfill requests for site and service updates and for products and 
            services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is 
            optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as 
            income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security 
            number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience 
            on our site. </p>
          <p>Order. We request information from the user on our order form. Here, 
            a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) 
            and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). 
            This information is used for billing purposes, with the help of our 
            business partner, and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble 
            processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch 
            with the user. </p>
          <p>Newsletter. If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask 
            for contact information such as his or her name and email address.</p>
          <p>Surveys &amp; Contests. From time-to-time our site requests information 
            from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys 
            or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice 
            whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested 
            may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), 
            and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact 
            information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey 
            information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the 
            use and satisfaction of this site. </p>
          <p>Tell-A-Friend. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing 
            a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email 
            address. MyDomain will automatically send the friend a one-time email 
            inviting them to visit the site. MyDomain stores this information 
            for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may 
            contact MyDomain at <a href="mailto:updates@dotster.com">updates@MyDomain.com 
            </a> to request the removal of this information from their database.</p>
          <p>1.4 Third party advertisers on MyDomain's site.</p>
          <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads (using methods 
            that include Pixel Tags and Clear Gifs) when you visit our Web site. 
            Our third-party advertising company also separately places or recognizes 
            a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements 
            to this Site. These companies may use information (not including your 
            name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits 
            to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about 
            goods and services of interest to you. </p>
          <p>1.5 Information MyDomain obtains from third parties.</p>
          <p>Supplemental information collected. In certain circumstances, in 
            order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, 
            it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with 
            information from 3rd party sources. For example, to determine if our 
            customers qualify for a dotPartner open account, we use their name 
            and business information to request a credit report. Once we determine 
            a user's credit-worthiness, this document is destroyed. </p>
          <p>MyDomain Accounts created by a Third Party on your Behalf. If you 
            received your domain name from someone else, without registering for 
            it yourself, your domain name may belong to a "managed domain." 
            In a managed domain, the administrator of a company with whom you 
            have a business relationship (for example, your ISP) can create your 
            domain name for you. You can then use the domain name like any other 
            domain name. The administrator, however, has access to the domain 
            name and can edit your MyDomain profile, reset your password, and manage 
            the MyDomain account without your additional consent. In addition to 
            the terms mentioned in this policy, an account created by a Third 
            party allows any of your personally identifiable information within 
            that account to be available to that Third Party as if they were you. 
            We have no access to or control over the third party to prevent their 
            disclosure of your information. </p>
          <p>2. How information collected by MyDomain is used. </p>
          <p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners 
            and advertisers. The aggregated demographic information is not linked 
            to any personally identifiable information that can identify any individual 
            person. </p>
          <p>We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and 
            services. These companies do not use personally identifiable information 
            for any use other than credit card processing; however, we will not 
            be responsible or liable for use of the information required by credit 
            card companies in contravention of their policies, contractual obligations 
            or general good business procedures.</p>
          <p>We submit the name, address, and phone number associated with the 
            registrant/administrator/technical/billing contact of a domain name 
            to the appropriate Registry/Central database for the domain name. 
            This information is included in a publicly available 'Whois' database, 
            in accordance with ICANN rules.</p>
          <p>In certain circumstances, we partner with third parties to provide 
            specific services. When the user signs up for a specific service provided 
            by the third party, we will share names, and other information that 
            is needed for the third party to provide the selected services. We 
            cannot control the use of PII by third parties, but do make reasonable 
            attempts to limit their use of the information to providing a user 
            with the services requested. </p>
          <p>Further, we provide personally identifiable information to respond 
            to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise 
            our legal rights or defend against legal claims. Further, we believe 
            it is necessary to share personally identifiable information in order 
            to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, 
            suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical 
            safety of any person, violations of MyDomain's terms of use, or as 
            otherwise required by law.</p>
          <p>3. Communications from MyDomain.</p>
          <p>Welcome Emails. We send a welcoming email to the email address associated 
            with the account a user has created to verify the users password and 
            username. This process is designed to prevent e-mail addresses from 
            being used without permission in the creation of a MyDomain account. 
            Established members will occasionally receive information on products, 
            services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the 
            privacy of our users we present the option to not receive some of 
            these types of communications. Please see our opt-out options below. 
          </p>
          <p>Site and Service Updates. We send the user site and service announcement 
            updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, 
            which contain important information about the site and/or service. 
            We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in 
            regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. </p>
          <p>Correction/Updating Personal Information. Users must provide accurate 
            and correct contact information (name, address, phone number) for 
            their domain names Administrative/Technical/Billing contacts, which 
            will be listed in a publicly accessible 'Whois' database, in compliance 
            with ICANN rules. If a user's personally identifiable information 
            changes (such as a zip code), or if a user no longer desires MyDomain's 
            services, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or 
            remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually 
            be done under online account management (on your own) or by emailing 
            our Customer Support for assistance.</p>
          <p>Opting out. Users are provided an opportunity to 'opt-out' of having 
            their information used for purposes not directly related to the services 
            they request for order at the point where we ask for the information. 
            For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who 
            buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can 
            keep their email address off of our lists. Users who no longer wish 
            to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from MyDomain and 
            its partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying 
            to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at <a href="mailto:updates@dotster.com">updates@MyDomain.com</a>.</p>
          <p>4. Underage customers.</p>
          <p>The MyDomain site is not intended for use by anyone under the age 
            of thirteen (13), and any individual under such age should not provide 
            MyDomain with personally identifiable information. MyDomain does not 
            knowingly contact, market to, or solicit, collect or use personally 
            identifiable information from or about any individual under the age 
            of thirteen (13). It is possible that by fraud or deception we may 
            receive information pertaining to children under thirteen (13). If 
            we are notified of that MyDomain has personal information regarding 
            a person under the age of thirteen (13), as soon as we reasonably 
            verify the information, we will either obtain parental consent or 
            otherwise delete the information from our servers. If you want to 
            notify MyDomain of our receipt of information by children under 18, 
            please do so by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:updates@dotster.com">updates@MyDomain.com</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>5. Linking to third-party websites.</p>
          <p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that 
            we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 
            We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to 
            read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects 
            personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies 
            solely to information collected by this Web site. </p>
          <p>6. Our privacy practices.</p>
          <p>When users submit sensitive information via the website, the information 
            is protected both online and off-line. </p>
          <p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information 
            (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information 
            is encrypted and is protected with encryption software. While on a 
            secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of 
            Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 
            becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 
            'surfing.'</p>
          <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, 
            we also take efforts to protect user-information off-line. Only employees 
            who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
            billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access 
            to personally identifiable information. In addition, the servers that 
            we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure 
            environment, behind a locked cage. </p>
          <p>It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your MyDomain 
            account password and not to share this information during chats, in 
            postings in newsgroups, or in other public forums. If you choose to 
            reveal or share your password and MyDomain account name, MyDomain is 
            unable to guarantee the security of your MyDomain account. </p>
          <p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you 
            can send an email to <a href="mailto:updates@dotster.com">updates@MyDomain.com</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>7. Changes to our privacy policy.</p>
          <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a notice 
            on our Home page so our users can review the changes and be aware 
            of what information we collect, how we use it, and under certain circumstances, 
            if any, we disclose it. </p>
          <p>8. Final Statement</p>
          <p>We at MyDomain will use your information in accordance with the privacy 
            policy that is currently in effect.</p>
          <p>(Effective Date - August 11, 2003)</p>
