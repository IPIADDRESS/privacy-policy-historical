                <h5><a name="2"></a>Information We Collect and How We Use It </h5>
                <p>We do NOT sell, rent, loan, trade, lease, or  otherwise share any personal information you provide or we collect with any  third party outside TelTel.com without your explicit consent. This section  describes all the ways in which we use your information.<br>
                <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="2a"></a>Registration </h5>
                <p>In order to use the TelTel, you must  first complete the registration form. During registration you are required to  provide a valid email address and to choose a password and display name. We use  your email address and password to validate your identity each time you login.  Your display name identifies you to other TelTel users. Other TelTel users do  not see your email address. </p>
                <p>When you register, we send you a single welcome  email. Clicking on the link in the welcome email allows us to verify that the  email address you provided is active and correct.<br>
                <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="2b"></a>Add A Friend Feature </h5>
                <p>If you choose to invite another person to  register with TelTel and join your Friend List, you have the option of sending  the invitation by email. The invitee's name (optional) and email address, and  your name (optional) are stored temporarily and are used only to generate the  email invitation. After the invitation is sent, we delete this information. In  particular, we do not store your name and if the invitee chooses not to  register with TelTel, we store no information about him or her. If the invitee  chooses to register with TelTel using a different email address, we store only  the information he or she explicitly provides during registration.<br>
                <a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>
                <h5><a name="2c"></a>Communications Contents </h5>
                <p>TelTel.com does NOT monitor or store the  contents of any call or conference in which you participate. The contents of  any Call Me request that you send or receive are stored on our servers until  they expire, until the sender and the receiver complete a call, or until the  sender removes them, AT WHICH TIME WE DELETE ALL RECORD OF THE CALL ME REQUEST.  A Call Me request comprises a sender, a receiver, an importance (High, Medium,  or Low), a short text message (optional), and an expiration time.<br>
                <a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>
                <h5><a name="2d"></a>Call Detail Records </h5>
                <p>All telephony applications retain Call Detail  Records (CDRs) for administrative and, possibly, billing purposes. A CDR is a  record of the caller, the callee, the date and timestamp, the elapsed time, and  the call failure class (in the case of an unsuccessful call). As stated in the  previous section, a CDR does not include any record of the call contents. CDRs  are automatically generated by our system and are stored centrally on TelTel.com  servers in the United States and/or China. <br>
                  <br>
                  TelTel.com uses the information contained in  CDRs in an aggregated statistical form for the purposes of improving service  quality and of detecting fraud or misuse. We reserve the right to share  aggregate usage data with third parties, but we do NOT sell, rent, loan, trade,  lease, or otherwise share personally identifiable information about your usage  patterns without your explicit consent. <br>
                  <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="2e"></a>Cookies </h5>
                <p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your  hard drive. TelTel.com uses encrypted ?î¯Šookies??to enable TelTel users to add  friends to their Friend Lists. Specifically, we do NOT use cookies to track  user behavior. Because the cookies are encrypted, they represent no threat to  the security of your personal information even if someone were to gain access  to your computer.<br>
                <a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>
                <h5><a name="2f"></a>Call Forwarding and Find-Me services</h5>
                <p>If users wish to use the TelTel Call-Forwarding and Find-Me services, users need to provide telephone numbers in order for the service to be provided. Collected information for such purposes is stored in TelTel servers through user submission.<br>
                  <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
                <h4><a name="3"></a>Risks and Disclaimers </h4>
                <p> </p>
                <h5><a name="3a"></a>Information You Share With Other TelTel Users </h5>
                <p>When you contact another TelTel user or  join a phone conference with other TelTel users, you should be aware that any  personal information you share with that user is potentially subject to misuse  and abuse. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information  that you choose to share with other TelTel users. </p>
                <p>Also be aware that, as with any peer-to-peer  communication application, another user of the TelTel software may be able to  obtain your IP address if you join a call or conference with that user. <br>
                <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="3b"></a>Legal Requests </h5>
                <p>In response to a verified request by a law enforcement or government agency relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can disclose your email address and usage patterns without a subpoena if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of this information is necessary to prevent imminent physical or mental harm, or financial loss. We will not disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government agencies for any other reason in the absence of a subpoena or court order. <br>
                <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="3c"></a>Personal Information Review and Change Request</h5>
                <p>We do not maintain any procedure for you to review or request changes to the information that we collect about you, except that you may request that we remove all information about you from our database by contacting us in accordance with the Account Deactivation and Deletion section below.<br>
                  <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="3d"></a>Account Deactivation and Deletion </h5>
                <p>Upon your request, we will deactivate your  account and delete all your personally identifiable information from our  databases as soon as reasonably possible provided we are under no obligation to  retain this information in response to a criminal investigation as described in  the previous section. Send your deactivation requests to <a href="mailto:delete@teltel.com">delete@teltel.com </a>. We will confirm receipt of your request and before deactivating  your account will verify that you sent the request.<br>
                <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="4"></a>Security </h5>
                <p>TelTel.com stores your information centrally on  servers in the United States and China. We use procedural and technical safeguards (including firewalls,  encryption, and access control lists) to protect this information against loss,  theft, or unauthorized access. Although we follow generally accepted industry  standards to protect the information you submit, both during transmission and  once we receive it, no method of transmission over the Internet or of  electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use  commercially acceptable means to safeguard your personal information, we cannot  guarantee its absolute security.<br>

                <h5><a name="5"></a>Change of Ownership</h5>
                <p>In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell our company or our assets, including the information collected through this website. If our Company or substantially all of our assets are acquired, customer information may be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer.<br>
