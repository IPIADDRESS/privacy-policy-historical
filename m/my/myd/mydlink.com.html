D-Link Corporation and its family of companies (alternatively referred to herein as "D-Link", "we" or "us") are committed to protecting your privacy. We recognize that the trust placed in us by our customers and web visitors requires comprehensive and responsible privacy protections, and we are therefore committed to providing you with a positive, easy, and secure online experience. 
<br><br>
We recognize the need to maintain the confidentiality of information that customers and web visitors reasonably expect to remain private. Our customers and web visitors expect, deserve and receive nothing less than our fullest commitment to their privacy. We also have an obligation to assist law enforcement and other government agencies responsible for protecting the public welfare, whether it be an individual or the security interests of the entire nation. If and when we are asked to help, we do so strictly within the law and under the most stringent conditions. 




<br><br>
<p style="font-weight:bolder; font-size:14px">The Scope of this Privacy Policy</p>

This Privacy Policy addresses the privacy of customers and web visitors in the United States. Where applicable, D-Link will comply with the laws of other countries that contain requirements that differ from this Policy. In certain jurisdictions outside the United States, a member of the D-Link family of companies may adopt a separate privacy policy to reflect the requirements of applicable local laws. For customers, this Privacy Policy is subject to the MyDlink Terms of Use and other agreements between you and D-Link. If you are a customer, please refer to the Terms of Use or such other agreements regarding certain rights and limitations with respect to your use of D-Link's web site and services. 
<br><br>
Our Privacy Policy explained: 
<br><br>
<p class="hilite">1. What information is collected?</p>

Any information you enter during the submission of forms or an order on any of D-Link's web sites may be collected and stored. In order to better define the type of information that is collected, we have identified and grouped it into three categories: 
<br>
a) Personal Information<br>
b) General Non-Specific &amp; Demographic Information<br>
c) Customer Proprietary Network Information <br><br>

<p style="font-weight:bolder">Personal Information</p>

We collect personal information regarding our customers, including information customers give us, information collected as a result of the customer's relationship with us and information we may obtain from other sources. Personal information, as defined by this Privacy Policy, is any information that can be used to identify you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, title, occupation, social security number, credit card number, and other information required to provide a service, deliver a product, or carry out a transaction you have requested. <br><br>

<p style="font-weight:bolder">General Non-Specific &amp; Demographic Information</p>

Any non-personal information either entered by you or recorded as part of the transaction process is considered to be General Non-Specific &amp; Demographic Information. This is information that does not contain personal information, and may include the type and quantities of products purchased, your web browser and operating system types, the identity of the web page from which your browser entered our web site, and any other demographic information which does not specifically identify any one individual. Such information is typically collected by the use of cookies, web logs, and web beacons. 
<br><br>
We may collect web usage information, such as the web pages you visit on our web sites, the amount of time you spend on such web pages, and whether you re-visit our web sites/pages. Such information may be tracked by recording the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), as well as your computer's IP address.<br><br>

<p style="font-weight:bolder">Customer Proprietary Network Information</p>

Should we provide telecommunications services to you, we may collect and maintain certain customer proprietary network information ("CPNI"). Your CPNI might include the types of telecommunications services you receive, usage information, and related billing information. Your telephone number, name, and address are not CPNI. <br><br>

We are committed to respecting and protecting your CPNI. Except as may be required by law or authorized by you, we do not sell, trade, or share your CPNI - including your calling records - with anyone outside of the D-Link family of companies or with anyone not authorized to represent us to offer our products or services, or to perform functions on our behalf.<br><br>

Generally, we may use your CPNI in the provision of services you purchase, including billing and collections for those services. Additionally, we are permitted to use or disclose CPNI to offer telecommunications services of the same type that you already purchase from us. We may also use or disclose your CPNI for legal or regulatory reasons such as in response to a court order or subpoena, or to investigate fraud and prevent the unlawful use of our network and services. We may additionally use CPNI to protect other customers.
<br><br>
<p class="hilite">2. What do we use the information for?</p> 

In order to provide you with the best online experience possible, we collect both personal and non-personal information to give us a better understanding of the demographic and geographic profile of our customers. The information we collect is reviewed closely to assist us in determining the most popular products of interest to our customers, and to better design our products and site(s) to suit your needs. 
<br><br>
By tracking your IP address through our site, we can better understand the types of products and information that are relevant to our customers, and may from time to time use this information to provide our customers with information or promotions that match their various geographical and demographic dynamics. 
<br><br>
From time to time, we may send surveys to our customers via email or online through our web sites in order to solicit feedback on improvements we should make to our products and/or web sites. These surveys are completed on a voluntary basis and personal and general information are not required. Refusal to complete the survey or poll will not result in any penalization of the customer(s) standings with our organization. Should you not wish to receive notification of subsequent surveys or polls, you can click the link supplied at the bottom of every promotional email we send you to request that you not receive such notifications in the future. 
<br><br>
We may also run contests and/or sweepstakes at various times. By entering the sweepstakes you agree to disclose your personal information for our use in future marketing campaigns. Your consent for our use of your information may be a condition of your participation and eligibility for any such contest or sweepstakes. 
<br><br>
In some cases we may combine web usage information related to your access to our web sites with personal information. We use the combined information to provide our customers and web visitors with a better online experience by providing customized features, services, and advertising. Once combined, the resulting data is protected as personal information as described in this Policy. 
<br><br>
We may occasionally provide you with the ability to create personal profile areas and view protected content. Your personal and/or other information may be required for such purposes. 
<br><br>
Additional ways in which we may use your personal and other information include: contacting you to provide you with shipping and billing information, exchanging information for purposes of accepting customer feedback and providing support, allowing you to forward information to another individual such as a friend or co-worker, and meeting contractual obligations. 
<br><br>
Should you contact us via the Contact Us page on our site, or via email, telephone or written correspondence, we may keep your comments on file for future use in our contact database.
<br><br>
<p class="hilite">3. Sharing Your Personal Information</p>

Your personal information will not be sold, traded, or rented to third-parties unless you grant us permission to do so and except as otherwise stated in this Policy. 
<br><br>
We may share your personal information within the D-Link family of companies for purposes of data processing or storage. We may also provide personal information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with D-Link under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help D-Link communicate with you about offers from D-Link and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share your information. 
<br><br>
When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that these parties agree to process such information strictly in accordance with our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 
<br><br>
We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your personal information and other related information if required by law. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
<br><br>
We may collect and possibly share personal information and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of D-Link's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law. 
<br><br>
We will ask you for your opt-in consent to share your personal information with a third party for any purpose not described above or as otherwise required by applicable law.
<br><br>
<p class="hilite">4. Use of Cookies</p> 

"Cookies" are files that are created by web sites and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can contain a variety of information, such as a simple count of how often you visit a web site or information that allows us to customize our web sites for your use. 
<br><br>
D-Link or a third party acting on our behalf may use cookies to tailor and improve the content we deliver to our web visitors, to improve our web sites by assessing which areas, features, and products are most popular, and to personalize our web sites and make recommendations based on information, including product choices, a particular visitor has previously provided. We may also use cookies to store user preferences, complete online order activity, and keep track of transactions. 
<br><br>
You can configure your web browser to alert you when a web site is attempting to send a cookie to your computer and allow you to accept or refuse the cookie. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer, including third party cookies, or delete cookies previously accepted, by adjusting your web browser preferences. Some web pages may not work correctly if you have cookies disabled. 
<br><br>
Web beacons (also known as "clear gifs" or "one-pixel gifs") are small graphic images on a web page or in an email that allow us to monitor the activity on our web sites or to make cookies more effective. D-Link or a third party acting on our behalf may use web beacons in certain of our web pages and emails to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and email correspondence.
<br><br>
<p class="hilite">5. Network and Information Security</p>

We maintain a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. When you are ordering services via the MyDlink web site, we use the Internet encryption protocol Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to protect the security of your personal information. The SSL protocol is also implemented for (i) guarding your account information when you are viewing your bills or orders on our web sites, and (ii) securing all logs of settings and online services of your device(s). D-Link will continue to revise its policies and implement additional security features as new technologies become available. However, no system or service can provide an absolute assurance of security, especially services that rely to some extent on the Internet. Therefore, by using our services and web site(s), you acknowledge the risk that third parties may gain unauthorized access to your information. If we determine that a security breach has occurred and that such breach creates a risk of identity theft or service disruption, we will make reasonable attempts to notify you. 
<br><br>
<p class="hilite">6. Linking to Third Party Sites and Services</p>

Our web sites or services may provide links to third party sites or services not maintained by D-Link. D-Link is not responsible for the privacy, security, or content of such sites and services. If you are asked to provide information on such sites or in connection with such services, we strongly encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies before sharing any information.

D-Link does not assume any liability for third parties that have been provided with information as permitted by this Privacy Policy or who have collected information as permitted by this Privacy Policy (such as advertisers using third party cookies).
<br><br>
<p class="hilite">7. Children's Privacy</p>

D-Link does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information on a child under the age of 13 without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian, we will delete that data from our systems. 
<br><br>
<p class="hilite">8. Effective Date and Policy Updates</p>

This Privacy Policy is made effective as of January 1, 2008 and supersedes and replaces all previously posted privacy policies. We reserve the right to update this Policy to reflect any changes we make in our privacy practices. As changes to our information gathering practices change, we will update this Policy as required. Information contained in this Policy may change at any time without notice, so please be sure to check our Privacy Policy statement regularly before disclosing any personal or non-personal information through this web site. 
<br><br>
<p class="hilite">
