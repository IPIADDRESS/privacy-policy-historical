<h2>What information does My Damn Channel collect?</h2>

<p>For visitors to our website and registered users, we log standard technical information, such as your IP address. If you choose to register with us, My Damn Channel requires you to provide your name, email address, and each user has a user ID and password that they choose. To maintain privacy it is important not to share your password with anyone.

In addition, for registered users, My Damn Channel will require you to provide geographical information such as your physical address.  In the future My Damn Channel may ask you to provide other demographic information, such as age, gender, interests or occupation. We may collect other personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or communicate with others through our systems.
