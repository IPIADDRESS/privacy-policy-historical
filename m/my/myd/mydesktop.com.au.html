    <p>
		You have come through to this page from a website which is owned and operated by Fairfax Media Limited.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this policy, "us", "we" or "our" means Fairfax Media Limited (ABN 15 008 663 161) and its related bodies corporate.
        <br>
        <br>
        This policy sets out:
        <br>

        </p><ul style="padding-left:40px">
			<li> what is considered personal information;</li>
			<li> what personal information we collect and hold;</li>
			<li> how we collect, hold, use or disclose personal information;</li>
			<li> the purposes for which we collect personal information;</li>
			<li> what happens if we are not able to collect personal information;</li>
			<li> how to seek access to and correct your personal information;</li>
			<li> whether we disclose personal information outside Australia; and</li>
			<li> how to contact us.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
		We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (subject to exemptions that apply to us under that Act).  However, due to the nature of some of our business activities, from time to time, we will handle personal information relying on the media exemption in the Act where appropriate.  Where we do so, we will ensure that we comply with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards.   We may also rely on related bodies corporate and employee records exemptions in the Act.  If you require more information on the collection and use of personal information in the course of journalism, please visit the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards at <a href="http://www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles">http://www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles</a>.

        <br>
        <br>
		We may, from time to time, review and update this policy, including taking account of new or amended laws, new technology and/or changes to our operations. All personal information held by us will be governed by the most recently updated policy. Your privacy matters to us, so whether you are new to Fairfax or are a long time user, please take the time to get to know our practices.

        <h2>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
			When used in this policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Act. In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This may include (but is not limited to) your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card, direct debit or PayPal account information. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.

        <div class="sstrap">
            <h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOLD</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
			We may collect the following types of personal information:
			</p><ul style="padding-left:40px">
				<li>name;</li>
				<li>mailing or street address;</li>
				<li>email address;</li>
				<li>telephone number;</li>
				<li>age or birth date;</li>
				<li>profession, occupation or job title;</li>

        <h2>COOKIES</h2>
        <p>
			In some cases we may also collect your personal information through the use of cookies. When you
			access our website, we may send a “cookie” (which is a small summary file containing a unique ID
			number) to your computer. This enables us to recognise your computer and greet you each time you
			visit our website, without bothering you with a request to register or log-in. It also helps us keep track of
			products or services you view, so that we can send you news about those products or services. We also
			use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to determine which areas of our websites have been visited, and
			to measure transaction patterns in the aggregate. We use this to research our users’ habits so that we
			can improve our online products and services. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your
			browser so that your computer does not accept them. We may also log IP addresses (the electronic
			addresses of computers connected to the internet) to analyse trends, administer the website, track user
			movements, and gather broad demographic information.
			<br>
			<br>
			We may also collect anonymous data (which is not personal information) relating to your activity on our
			websites (including IP addresses) via cookies, or we may collect information from you in response to a
			survey. We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services,
			diagnose problems and target and improve the quality of our products and services. To the extent this
			information does not constitute personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else,
			the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply and we may use this information for any purpose and by
			any means whatsoever.

        <p>
			You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us

			with suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you. We will not charge for
			simply making a request and will not charge for making any corrections to your personal information. If
			you make an access request, we will ask you to verify your identity. There may be instances where we
			cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, we may need to refuse
			access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others, or if it would result in a breach of
			confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.

			<br>
			If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then
			you may request us to amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not
			agree that there are grounds for amendment, then we will add a note to the personal information
			stating that you disagree with it.
