    <b>A WORD OF CAUTION</b>
    <p>Identity theft is one of South Africa's fastest growing crimes and one that can result in significant damage to an individual's credit report. There are a number of ways that you could fall victim to this crime, including "phishing" (seemingly genuine but forged e-mails from a seemingly reputable company that ask you to provide them with personal information in a linked website) and "garbage sifters" (individuals who sort through your rubbish looking for bank statements, invoices, etc. that reveal your personal information. The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to be alert and aware of suspicious activities and modus operandi used by potential fraudsters.</p>

    <b>CONTACTING TRANSUNION</b>
    <p>Consumers' are welcome to contact TransUnion should they require more information or have any questions. We can be contacted using the details indicated in this Privacy Policy above.</p>
