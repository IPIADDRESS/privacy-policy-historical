		<div class="pagetext"><p><strong>MyTopFreeGames.com Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Updated: </strong>February 10, 2011</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information Play Turtle LLC (the “Company” or “we”) collects from individuals who visit the mytopfreegames.com website (the “Site” or “mytopfreegames”) and/or participate in the resources offered by mytopfreegames (“User(s)” or “you”). This Policy also explains how the Company uses and maintains that information.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first email <a href="mailto:support@mytopfreegames.com">MyTopFreeGames Support</a></p>
<p><strong>Partnership:</strong></p>
<p><strong>MyTopFreeGames.com </strong>Is Powered by IWON a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC (NASDAQ: IACI).</p>
<p>In order to access the free games on MTFG users will need to download and install the MyWebSearch Toolbar.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy, the mytopfreegames home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on the mytopfreegames home page.</p>
<p><strong><br> This Policy applies only to Information collected on mytopfreegames and not to information collected or obtained from other sources. </strong></p>
<p>We collect two kinds of information (“Information”) through the Site. The first kind is information that can identify you as a specific individual – such as your nameand email address (“PII”). <strong>We only collect PII when you have contacted us directly or forwarded content from our site to someone else</strong>. (See “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</span>” below). The second kind of information is the kind of non-personally identifiable information (“NPII”) collected and stored automatically by many websites. It includes, for example, information about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on mytopfreegames. Although this information is related to you, it is not associated with your PII and cannot be linked to you personally. If you register to play Premium Games, the NPII collected may also include your internet protocol and HTML information about the content of web pages you visit.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not want your Information to continue to be collected and used as provided in this Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site again.</strong></p>
<p>Game players have access to the Games at no charge in exchange for their agreement to install the IWON Software (the “Software”) on their computers or other computing device. The Software allows us to provide a User with the MyWebSearch Toolbar. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No PII is collected through the Software</span>.</p>
<p><strong><br> Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>PII is collected by MyTopFreeGames by using one of the following Site features:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you communicate with us via the <em>Contact Us</em> page, mytopfreegames asks for your name and e-mail address so that you can      receive a response.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br> If you do not want us to collect your PII as described above or to use and share your PII as described further below in this Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through any of the mytopfreegames features described above. By providing us with your PII using any of these features, you are authorizing our use and sharing of your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Policy that we may publish on the Site.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br> Updating Your Personally Identifiable Information.</strong></p>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or remove it by emailing our Customer Support at<br> <a href="mailto:support@mytopfreegames.com">MyTopFreeGames Support</a></p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
<p>mytopfreegames and the content available or emails delivered in connection withmytopfreegames, are neither intended for, nor directed to, nor to be accessed by, persons under the age of 13.<br> <strong>We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>Play Turtle LLC reserves the right to use PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as stated above; (2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; or (3) as disclosed in this Policy.</p>
<p>In addition, if Play Turtle LLC goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on the mytopfreegames home page for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your PII.</p>
<p>Play Turtle LLC reserves the right to disclose PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p>
<p><strong><br> Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>As with manywebsites, when you visit mytopfreegames, mytopfreegames automatically gathers certain NPII based on your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information is used to customize your experience at mytopfreegames, to help us improve the quality of mytopfreegames and to make your visits to mytopfreegames easy, convenient and fun. mytopfreegames also collects your IP (Internet protocol) address to help diagnose problems with the Site server and for Site administration purposes.</p>
<p>Finally, we and some of our Third Party Advertisers as well as third party ad servers also use cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs, and other monitoring technologies to gather anonymous information. The most common of these technologies are described in more detail below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies</span>. Cookies are small data files that the mytopfreegames server places on an individual’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site and the Company. We do not tie any PII to the cookies that we set. Cookies also enable us, or our Third Party Advertisers, to use anonymous behavioral profiles and demographic inferences to increase the relevance of online ads that Premium Members receive. Some mytopfreegames ads include “web beacons” and some of our Third Party Advertisers may include web beacons on some of their web pages at our request. These web beacons allow us to access the cookies we set and provide ad campaign analysis. While some Web browsers allow a User to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the User’s computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that our cookies provide. If you ever uninstall the Software, no Play Turtle LLC cookies or tracking assets will remain. <strong>. The use of cookies by Third Party Advertisers or ad servers is not subject to this Policy, but is subject to those third parties’ respective privacy policies. If you have a question about such third parties’ privacy policies, you will have to go to their websites for more information and/or contact them directly</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clear GIFs</span>. We employ or our third party business partners may employ a common technology known as a “Clear GIF” or “1-by-1 Pixel” on the Site and in e-mail communications with Users. A Clear GIF, or “graphic interface format” is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1×1 pixel) that is placed on the Site or in an e-mail. The GIFs do not contain any PII but they, provide us with important information about how Users use mytopfreegames and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, mytopfreegames or our Business Partners are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative presentations. We may also allow our Third Party Advertisers the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track Premium Users who link from the Third Party Advertisers’ respective sites to mytopfreegames, but this ability to track does not allow the Third Party Advertisers access to Premium User PII.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use and Sharing of Non-Personally Identifiable Information (NPII)</strong></p>
<p>Play Turtle LLC shares NPII with our Business Partners in order to customize the services they and mytopfreegames provide to you. And of course, we may also disclose any of the NPII collected through mytopfreegames or the Software in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect our rights and property or thatof or our Users.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect Information from unauthorized access and improper use. We keep Information on servers that are protected by firewalls and located in a physically secure facility accessible only to authorized our employees. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though, that, despite our reasonable efforts, no security measures are impenetrable and any connection to mytopfreegames or information transmitted to us or to mytopfreegames will be at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Links from the Site</strong></p>
<p>Mytopfreegames provides links to the websites of many of our Business Partners. If you link to any of these third party Web sites, our privacy policy will not apply to your use of, and activities on, those sites. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these sites, including their privacy policies. Play Turtle LLC shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, these sites. All inquiries concerning the use of PII by a third party must be communicated to that third party and not to mytopfreegames or Play Turtle LLC.</p>
<p><strong>Deactivate Software</strong></p>
<p>Premium Users who have downloaded the Software and who do not want their NPII collected as described above should immediately deactivate the Software. You may deactivate the Software by visiting the <a href="http://www1.iwon.com/software_products/uninstall/">Uninstall Page</a> and following the directions to remove the Software from your computer, or by selecting the appropriate entry in your Control Panel using the “Add or Remove Programs” icon. Deactivating the Software means that you will no longer have access to the Premium Games on the Site.</p>
