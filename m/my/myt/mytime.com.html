do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to law
enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts where we operate. If MyTime is involved in
a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email
and/or prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your
Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal
Information. </li>
<li>We encourage MyTime Merchants and Partners to adopt and post privacy policies.
However, the use of your Personal Information by such third parties is governed by the
conduct and privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control. </li>
<li>We may also disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable. For
example, we may utilize or provide our merchants, business partners, or other third
parties with reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our users. </li>
<li>If a user of the MyTime Scheduler has a client who is a MyTime user, that Merchant may
appear in the MyTime user’s Favorites page, and MyTime may contact this user through
email, text, or push notification to promote booking at that Merchant or others in the
MyTime marketplace. MyTime users have the option of managing their communications
preferences or opting out. </li>
<li>MyTime may contact Merchant employees through email to invite them to create a
MyTime account with a restricted login. </li>
<li>When a particular merchant is added to your Favorites Page, that information will be
automatically made public and will enable other users to search, visit, or book
appointments from your Favorites Page. Additionally, your page will display your real
name, partial name, or pseudo name, as well as any other information you provided,
including photographs, bios, and city and state. You may, however, hide this information
from the public by marking your Favorite Page as Private. </li>
<li>If you are a Merchant or are using the MyTime Scheduler:</li>
<ul>
<li>We may share some or all of your Personal Information, including but not limited
to Calendaring Program Information, Staff Member Names, Service Offerings,
Ratings and Reviews, Prices and Discounts, appointment availability, and related
data (collectively "Merchant Information") with end users who have signed up or
registered for MyTime and with MyTime Business Partners and affiliates with
which MyTime is working; </li>
<li>We may feed Merchant Information to third party websites (excluding customer
lists), which may result in Merchant Information appearing on a third-party
website, mobile application or in search engine results; and such results may
include a corresponding link to schedule an appointment through MyTime. </li>
<li>We may use certain Contact Information to promote your goods and services
through a variety of online and offline advertising and promotion mediums,
including, but not limited to Google, Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, Twitter,
email distribution lists, and third-party Business Partners and Affiliates. </li>
<li>If you have participated in any joint MyTime service offerings or promotions with
other Partners, MyTime may disclose your Personal Information to its Partners
and/or advertisers, as part of such offer, contest, or other activity that is provided
by or in conjunction with MyTime and its business partners and in which you
have elected to participate. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Collection and Use of Information About Your Computer</b></p>
<p>Certain features of the MyTime Service and MyTime Scheduler connect to MyTime computer
systems over the Internet. You will not receive a separate notice when these features connect. By
using the MyTime Service or MyTime Scheduler, you expressly consent to the transmission and
use of this information as set forth herein. These services use Internet protocols, which send to
the appropriate systems computer information, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address;</li>
<li>type of operating system; </li>
<li>browser and name and version; </li>
<li>your hardware information; </li>
<li>your regional and language settings; </li>
<li>version of the Software you are using; and </li>
<li>language code of the device where you installed any MyTime software. </li>
</ul>
<p>MyTime uses this information to make other features and services available to you. MyTime
may use the computer information to improve the MyTime Service. We may also share such
non-personal information with others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may use the
information to improve how their products run with the MyTime Service. </p>
<p><a name="cookie"></a><b>Cookies and Related Technologies</b></p>
<p>When you use the MyTime Site, we collect certain information by automated or electronic
means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools,
and web server logs. As you use the MyTime Site, your browser and devices communicate with
servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the
interactivity and fill your requests for services and information. </p>
<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in
web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to the
MyTime Site by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies
managed by us, our business partners or our service providers. </p>
<p>For example, when you visit the MyTime Site, MyTime and our service providers may place
cookies, including persistent cookies, on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to
recognize you when you return, track and target your interests in order to provide a customized
experience. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain
information you have previously provided (such as your user ID if you asked to be remembered),
and storing your preferences (e.g., the cities for which you want to be shown MyTime Service
offerings). </p>
<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that
allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access these
pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to
us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications
and improve our web pages and promotions. </p>
<p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For
example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access the MyTime Site, your
operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings,
as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers
routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the IP
addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Sites. We may also collect information
about the website you were visiting before you came to the MyTime Site and the website you
visit after you leave our Site, if this information is supplied to us by your browser. </p>
<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in nonidentifiable
ways, the MyTime Site but we may also associate the information we collect using
cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. Additionally, if the settings on your
location-aware device allow us to receive Mobile Location Information, we will collect that
automatically. This Privacy Policy governs how we would use these types of information. </p>
<p>MyTime has relationships with third party advertising companies to place advertisements on our
behalf onto other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for the MyTime Site
and our advertisements. These third parties may automatically collect information about your
visit to the Site and other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use to visit
this Site. They do this by using cookies, clear gifs and other technologies. Information collected
may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better
understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other websites tracked by these third
parties. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection methods or use of the information
collected by these third parties, and MyTime is not responsible for cookies or clear gifs in third
party ads. We encourage you to review the privacy policies or statements of these third party
advertising companies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technologies. If you
would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this
information used by third party advertisers, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>. </p>

information in connection with your use of our Site. If you wish not to be tracked by our third
party web analytics service, please click on the following link(s) for further instructions on how

<p>We also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store user preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.</p>
<p><b>Referral Programs</b></p>
<p><b>A. Referring Friends to MyTime.</b> MyTime enables you to refer friends to MyTime. If you wish
to refer friends to MyTime, we provide you a unique referral link, which you can share directly
with others via email, social media websites, or other communications methods. If someone
clicks your link and takes a qualifying action, we may attribute that referral to you for certain
purposes such as awarding reward credit. MyTime does not collect Personal Information about
the persons with whom you share your link until the persons click the link and engage directly
with MyTime. </p>
<p><b>B. Referring Merchants to MyTime.</b> MyTime enables you to refer Merchants to MyTime. When
you refer a new Merchant, we send out an email to such Merchant indicating that you are the
referral source. Except for your name, no other information is provided to the Merchant in our
email. </p>
<p><b>C. Authorization.</b> By using the referral features on MyTime, you hereby agree to and authorize
the following: (a) MyTime may use your e-mail address to email your contact about MyTime,
(b) MyTime may use your name and e-mail address to identify who you are in any such
invitation, and (c) MyTime may follow up with any invitations initiated by you with two
reminder emails to some contacts if they do not respond to the initial invitation. </p>
<p><b>Your Choices</b></p>
<p>We think that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we know more about you
and the kinds of service offerings you like. However, you can limit the information you provide
to MyTime, and you can limit the communications that MyTime sends to you. </p>
<p>You can manage your email preferences by logging into your account through
www.mytime.com, entering the "My Account" section, and updating your Email Communication
preferences under "Account Info." You can also manage your subscriptions by following
subscription management instructions contained in the commercial messages that we send you.
You may choose to subscribe to some types of messages, and may choose to unsubscribe from
others. You may update your subscription preferences from time to time. Please note that even if
you unsubscribe from promotional email or text messages, we may still need to contact you with
important transactional information related to your account and your purchases. For example,
even if you have unsubscribed from our promotional email or text messages, we will still send
you confirmations when you book a service through the MyTime Site. </p>
<p>You may manage how your browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting its
privacy and security settings. Browsers are different, so refer to instructions related to your
browser to learn about cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be
available. You can opt-out of being targeted by certain third party advertising companies online
at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>. </p>
<p>You may manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share Location Information with
MyTime, as well as how your mobile browser handles cookies and related technologies by
adjusting your mobile device privacy and security settings. Please refer to instructions provided
by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your
settings. </p>
<p>You may also manage the sharing of certain Personal Information with us when you connect
with us through a social media platform or application, such as through Facebook Connect.
Please refer to the privacy settings of the social media website or application to determine how
you may adjust our permissions and manage the interactivity between MyTime and your social
media account or your mobile device. </p>
<p>If you wish to opt out of receiving offers directly from MyTime merchants or business partners,
you can follow the opt-out instructions in the emails that they send you. </p>
<p><b>Accessing and Correcting Personal Information</b></p>
<p>Keeping Personal Information about you current helps ensure that we offer you the best service
offerings available through our Merchants and Business Partners. You can access, update and
delete your Contact Information, Financial Account Information, and the other information you
provided to use in your profile by logging into your account and accessing the "My Account"
section of the Website or sending us an email at <a href="mailto:support@mytime.com">support@mytime.com</a>. </p>
<p>If you want to close your account or have other questions or requests, please contact us. While
we are ready to assist you in managing your subscriptions, closing your account, and removing
your active profile, we cannot always delete records of past interactions and transactions. </p>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
services and to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting purposes. If you
wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you
services contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mytime.com">support@mytime.com</a>. We will retain and use your information as
necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
<p><b>Security of Personal Information</b></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. MyTime has implemented an
information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that
are designed to reasonably safeguard Personal Information. When you enter sensitive
information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of
that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both
during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its
absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at
<a href="mailto:support@mytime.com">support@mytime.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>Notice to Residents of Countries outside the United States of America</b></p>
<p>MyTime is headquartered in the United States of America. Personal Information may be
accessed by us or transferred to us in the United States or to our affiliates, business partners,
merchants, or service providers elsewhere in the world. By providing us with Personal
Information, you consent to this transfer. We will protect the privacy and security of Personal
Information according to our Privacy Policy, regardless of where it is processed or stored. </p>
<p><b>Privacy Practices of Third Parties</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information by MyTime through
your interaction with the MyTime Site. Other websites that may be accessible through links from
the MyTime Site may have their own privacy policies and personal information collection,
use, and disclosure practices. Our Merchants may have their own privacy policies, too. We
encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies provided by these other parties
prior to providing them with information or taking advantage of an offer or promotion. </p>
<p><b>Communities </b></p>
<p>The MyTime Site may contain Communities and other areas where you may be able to publicly
post information, communicate with others such as discussion boards or blogs, review products
and merchants, and submit media content. Prior to posting in these areas, please read our Terms
of Use carefully. All the information you post will be accessible to anyone with Internet access,
and any Personal Information you include in your posting may be read, collected, and used by
others. For example, if you post your email address along with a public merchant review, you
may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. Please avoid publicly posting Personal
Information. If you have questions about Personal Information posted in our Communities,
please contact <a href="mailto:support@mytime.com">support@mytime.com</a>. </p>
<p><b>Facebook Connect</b></p>
<p>MyTime offers Facebook users the opportunity to interact with friends and to share on Facebook
using Facebook Connect. If you are logged into both MyTime and Facebook, when you use the
Site's Facebook connection functions, we will link your Facebook account with your MyTime
account if the email addresses match. If the email addresses do not match, we may ask you if you
want to link them and you must validate that you control the accounts. If you are already logged
into MyTime but not logged into Facebook, when you use the Site's Facebook connection
functions, you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to sign up for Facebook.
By proceeding through any of these scenarios, you grant MyTime permission to access your
Facebook profile information and to use it in accordance with the Facebook terms of use and this
Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>If you are not currently registered as a MyTime user and you use the Site's Facebook connection
functions, you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option
to register and join MyTime. Once you register with MyTime and connect with Facebook, you
will be able to automatically post recent MyTime activity back to your Facebook wall. Please
refer to the privacy settings in your Facebook account to manage the performance of your
Facebook account. </p>
<p><b>Social Media Widgets</b></p>
<p>The MyTime Site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook “like” button, Pinterest
Pin button, and Twitter Follow button. These Features may collect your IP address, the page you
are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social
Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.
Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company
providing it. </p>
<p><b>Testimonials</b></p>
<p>We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mytime.com">support@mytime.com</a>. </p>
<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy to clarify our practices or to reflect new or
different privacy practices, such as when we add new features to the MyTime Site. If we make
any material changes we will notify you by means of notice on the MyTime Site prior to the
change becoming effective and additionally may, at our discretion, notify you by email (sent to
the email address specified in your account) of such changes. We encourage you to periodically
review this page for the latest information about our privacy practices. </p>
<p><b>Links to Other Websites</b></p>
<p>The MyTime Site contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an
endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not
exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or
other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you.
Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable
information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of
the other websites you visit. </p>
<p><b>Children</b></p>
<p>The Sites are not directed to persons under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without the parent or guardian's consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mytime.com">support@mytime.com</a>. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from minors under 18. If we become aware that a minor under 18 has provided us with personal identifiable information, we will use reasonable commercial efforts to promptly delete such information from our files. </p>
<p><b>California Privacy Rights</b></p>
