			<br>
							<br>Money Mart collects, uses and discloses personal information for the following purposes:
				</p><ul class="privacy-list terms-list">
								<li>
									<span>To provide financial services to customers;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To develop, manage and market products and services to meet the needs of customers;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To obtain credit information and credit reports from credit reporting agencies to assess credit history and credit worthiness and to confirm accuracy of information provided by individuals;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To confirm details of customer employment;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To contact customers for products and services that may be of interest;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To determine the eligibility of customers for different products and services that may be of interest;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To extract certain information for the purpose of generating statistics for our internal purposes;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To ensure a high standard of service to customers;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To record, track and respond to customer feedback and complaints;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To meet legal and regulatory requirements;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To confirm the identity of a customer; and</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>To collect debt that may become owed to Money Mart by a customer.</span>
								</li>
							</ul>

			<p>Money Mart will identify any new purpose(s) for which  personal information is being collected, used or disclosed. Customers will be informed by either posting a notice on the Money Mart website (<a href="http://www.moneymart.ca">www.moneymart.ca</a>), written notification or direct communication.</p>

<h2>CONSENT</h2>
       <p>Notice will be given and consent obtained when collecting, using and disclosing personal information, except when deemed inappropriate.
			<br>
							<br>Money Mart will make a reasonable effort to ensure that all customers have an understanding of the purpose(s) for which personal information is collected, used or disclosed.
			<br>
							<br>Money Mart will obtain consent to use and disclose personal information at the time the personal information is collected. Money Mart may also obtain consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected, but prior to the personal information being used or disclosed for a new purpose.
			<br>
							<br>Consent shall not be obtained through deception. An  individual’s consent may be explicit or implied. Consent can be given either orally, electronically or in writing. Use of products and services offered by Money Mart constitutes implied consent for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information for all identified purposes.
			<br>
							<br>Money Mart may collect, use or disclose personal information without the individual’s knowledge and consent in certain circumstances. For example:<br>
							<br>
							</p><ul class="privacy-list terms-list">
								<li>
									<span>When the collection, use, and disclosure is permitted or required by law;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>When the collection, use, and disclosure is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely manner;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>When seeking the consent of the individual may defeat the purpose of collecting the information;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>When use of the information is for an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an individual;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>When needed to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or as otherwise required or authorized by law;</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>When the information is solely for Journalistic, Artistic, or Literary Intent; or</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>When the information is publicly available.</span>
								</li>
							</ul>
			
			<p>An individual may withdraw consent at any time subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Refusal or withdrawal of consent by a customer may prevent Money Mart from providing a product or service to that customer. Money Mart will not unreasonably withhold products or services from a customer who refuses or withdraws consent, but if the personal information is required to offer the product or service, Money Mart may decline to deal with the customer who will not consent to the use of such personal information. Money Mart may be contacted for more information regarding the method by which consent can be withdrawn.</p>
