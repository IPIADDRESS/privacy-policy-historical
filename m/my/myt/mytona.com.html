</p>
<p>In certain specific circumstances you have a right to ask us to delete your Personal Data which we are holding about you. We will pass your request onto other recipients of your personal information unless that is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. If you would like to ask us for further information on the specific circumstances, and who the other recipients are, and/or exercise your right to erasure please contact us, using the contact details described in Section 12 below. Please note some things can only be deleted when you delete our games from your mobile devices and clear our cookies from any device that you have used for our Services. In that case you will permanently lose all your game progress, Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods without the right to data recovery or refund. Where we delete Personal Data about you, we may still retain some or all of that information for other purposes such as maintaining financial records, protecting or enforcing legal rights, maintaining marketing suppression lists or for technical reasons such as maintaining technical security or our database integrity. We may also retain your information in an anonymised form. In some instances, personal information about you that is visible through gameplay such as username, avatar, your high scores and any chat messages may be cached on other players‚Äô devices and we may not be able to remove or update that data from those devices, for example if that device is not connected to a network. You can ask us for further information on the specific circumstances and who the other recipients are, using the contact details described in Section 12 below.
</p>
<p>11.4. Right to restriction of processing your personal data.
</p>

</p>
<p>11.5. Right to object at any time to processing of your personal data when processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
</p>
<p>11.6. Right to opt-out of direct or target interest advertising on mobile applications by checking the privacy settings on your device settings menu. Please note that even if you use your right to opt-out it you will still receive advertising, but not direct or target interest. On Apple you can opt-out this by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Advertising and turning on ‚ÄúLimit Ad Tracking‚Äù. On Android you can opt-out by going to Settings &gt; Google services &gt; Ads and turning on choosing ‚ÄúOpt out of Ads Personalization‚Äù.
</p>
<p>11.7. Right to portability of your personal data. In some circumstances, you may have the right to request that data which you have provided to us is provided to you, so you can transfer this to another data controller.
</p>
<p>11.8. Right to withdraw your consent at any time if we are processing your personal data with your consent.
</p>
<p>11.9. Right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
</p>
<p>11.10. We do not carry out any decision-making based solely on automated processing, including profiling unless we have your consent or we need to do so to perform a contract with you.
