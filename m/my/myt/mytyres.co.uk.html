<h1>Privacy policy</h1><h4>I. General</h4>
<p><strong>1. Information regarding the collection of personal data</strong></p>
<p>In the following we inform about the collection of personal data when using our website. Personal data are all data that refer to you personally e.g. name, address, email addresses, user behaviour.</p>
<p>The party responsible pursuant to Article 4 para. 7 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is Deltilog Ltd. 6 Langdale Court Market Square Witney Oxfordshire OX28 6FG, Telephone: 0207 6640702, Email: info@delti.com, Website: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mytyres.co.uk">www.mytyres.co.uk</a> (see our imprint details). Our Data protection officer can be reached at <a href="mailto:datenschutz@delti.com">datenschutz@delti.com</a> or at our postal address with the addition "FAO Data protection officer".</p>
<p>The use of our website functions is fundamentally possible without the processing of personal data. Please refer to the corresponding remarks below concerning the (personal) data transmitted technically to us by you. If we use contracted service providers for the individual functions of our offer or if we wish to use your data for advertising purposes, we shall inform you in detail below regarding the respective procedures. Finally, we also name the criteria of storage duration established.</p>
<p><strong>2. Purposes and legal basis of the processing</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated or specified, the purpose of our data processing activities is the pursuit of our own business purposes.</p>
<p>We use different legal bases for the data processing.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you give us consent for certain processing operations of personal data, the legal basis is Article 6 I lit. a of the GDPR hereinafter also referred to as "<strong>consent</strong>").</li>
<li>If the processing of personal data is necessary for the initiation or performance of a contract whose (potential) contracting party is the data subject, e.g. if you inquire about products and/or order goods with us and the data processing is necessary for the delivery of the goods, Article 6 I lit. b of the GDPR is the legal basis (hereinafter also referred to as "<strong>contract performance</strong>").</li>
<li>If the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation, e.g. for the fulfilment of tax filing obligations, Article 6 I lit. c of the GDPR is the legal basis.</li>
<li>If the processing of personal data is necessary for the protection of vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, e.g. if a visitor to one of our warehouses were injured and his/her data had to be forwarded to a doctor and/or hospital, Article 6 I lit. d of the GDPR is the legal basis.</li>
<li>The processing of personal data may, according to Article 6 I lit. f of the GDPR, be permitted under data protection law if it is necessary for the protection of a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, insofar as the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the person concerned do not predominate (hereinafter also referred to as "<strong>balance of interests</strong>"). We consider the performance of our business in the interest of safeguarding the jobs of our employees and of the well being of shareholders as our fundamental legitimate interest. This is also covered by the legitimate interests of companies expressly described by the European legislator. Therefore, a legitimate interest can be assumed if the data subject and the company are in a customer relationship (Recital 47 sentence 2 of the GDPR) or personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Your rights</strong></p>
<p>You have the following rights regarding us with respect to the personal data concerning you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right to information</li>
<li>Right to rectification or deletion</li>
<li>Right to restriction of processing</li>
<li>Right to object to the processing</li>
<li>Right to data portability</li>
</ul>
<p>You also have the right to complain to us about the processing of your personal data by means of a data protection supervisory authority. Your rights are regulated in Chapter 3 of the GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>4. Existence of automated decision making</strong></p>
<p>You are welcome to pay for your order on account. We would like to draw your attention to the fact that, when selecting this payment method, we perform a credit risk assessment based on mathematical statistical procedures at the credit agency CEG Creditreform Boniversum GmbH, 41460 Neuss (Scoring). For this purpose, the personal data necessary for the credit check, [name, date of birth, address, bank details] are transferred to the credit agency, whereby your address data are also taken into account. The collection, storage and disclosure is therefore for the purpose of a credit check to avoid payment default and on the basis of Article. 6 para.1 S.1 lit. b of the GDPR and of Article 6 para. 1 S. 1 lit. fâ of the GDPR. On the basis of this information, a statistical probability for loan default and therefore your solvency is calculated. If the credit check is positive, an order on account shall be possible. If the credit check is negative, payment on account shall not be possible. The decision as to whether an order is possible on account, is based solely on an automated decision of our online shop system, which is carried out by our commissioned credit agency, so that an individual manual examination of your documents by one of our employees is not performed.</p>
<p><strong>5. Opposition to or revocation of the processing of your data</strong></p>
<p>If you have given your consent to the processing of your data, you can revoke it at any time. Such a revocation will affect the legitimacy of the processing of your personal data after you have notified us.</p>
<p>Insofar as we base the processing of your personal data on the balance of interests, you may object to the processing. This is the case if, in particular, the processing is not required to fulfil a contract with you, which is described by us in each case in the following description of functions. In the event of such a revocation, we shall ask you to explain the reasons why we should not process your personal data as we have done. In the case of a justified objection, we will examine the situation and will either discontinue or adapt the data processing or inform you of our compelling legitimate reasons with which we continue the processing.</p>
<p>Of course, you are entitled to object to the processing of your personal data for advertising and data analysis purposes at any time. Concerning your objection to advertising, you can contact us using the details shown in section 1.</p>
<p><strong>6. Recipients and categories of recipients of your personal data</strong></p>
<p>Information about our customers is important to us and helps us optimise the services we offer. We only pass on the information we receive to third parties in the extent described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Associated companies: Delticom forwards personal data (and user data) to associated companies and their subsidiaries for the purposes of order processing. These companies are either subject to this privacy policy, or follow guidelines which provide at least as much protection as this privacy policy.</li>
<li>Service providers: We engage other companies and individuals to fulfil certain tasks for us. Examples include: Parcel delivery, sending letters or emails, processing payments (credit card, direct debits, invoices), maintenance of our customer lists, analysis of our databases, advertising activity and customer service. These service providers have access to the personal information they need to fulfil their tasks. However, they may not use this for other purposes. Furthermore, they are obligated to handle the information in accordance with this privacy policy and the current data protection legislation.</li>
<li>Service providers outside the EU/EEA: We can not rule out that our subcontractors use other service providers in third countries. Pursuant to Article 28 para. 4 of the GDPR we obligate all service providers to adhere to adequate and appropriate guarantees in accordance with Article 44 ff. of the GDPR (transfer to third countries).</li>
<li>"Predict" Service"<br> We always strive to improve our service to the customer and to make the purchase up to the acceptance of the goods customer friendly, time saving and self-determined. We now offer you the so-called "Predict" service in the national shipping of goods purchased from us. You will first be informed by our service provider via SMS and/or email that your parcel is on its way and the delivery is expected to take place the following day. If this day is suitable for you, you do not have to do anything else. If the day is not suitable, you have various change options which make receiving the goods more flexible, pleasant and safe for you. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.dpd.com" target="_blank">www.dpd.com</a></li>
<li>Newsletters/Surveys: We offer you the opportunity to subscribe to our newsletter, for example on <a href="https://www.mytyres.co.uk" target="_blank">https://www.mytyres.co.uk</a>. If you do not want to receive such offers, you can unsubscribe at any time at <a href="https://www.mytyres.co.uk" target="_blank">https://www.mytyres.co.uk</a> or send us an email to <a href="mailto:info@delti.com">info@delti.com</a>. In the future, you will also be able to change your settings simply via your user account "My account".<br> At the end of every order, you have an opportunity to take part in a survey and give us permission to pass on your data to third parties for marketing activities. We only pass on your data to specially selected partners or send offers to you on behalf of other companies if you actively confirm this option. If you do so, this company shall not receive your name or address or other personal data which could identify you. There is no connection between the survey and the passing on of your data to third parties for marketing purposes. That means you can also complete the marketing survey without giving us permission to pass on your data to third parties and vice versa, if you wish. The legal basis is Article 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR ("Consent").</li>
<li>Protection of Delticom and third parties We pass on customer account and personal data about customers if we are legally obligated to do so, or if this is required to implement our general terms and conditions of business or other agreements, or to protect our rights as well as the rights of our customers and third parties. This includes the exchange of data with companies who specialise in the prevention and minimisation of the effects of misuse of credit cards and fraud. We explicitly state that in this regard, the data is not passed on for commercial use which contradicts the terms of this privacy policy.</li>
<li>Information concerning the verification of your address (check for deliverability) is available from infoscore Consumer Data GmbH, Rheinstrasse 99, 76532 Baden-Baden. For this purpose, we send the required data (your full name, address and, if applicable, date of birth) to the named company. In the future, it will also use this data for purposes of address verification or identity checks against other companies as well as for corresponding scoring applications. Scoring calculates, based on mathematical statistical methods, the probability values for specific future behaviour and uses the corresponding data for this purpose. The legal basis of the data processing is Article 6 para. 1 S.1 lit. f of the GDPR ("Balance of interests").</li>
<li>Voluntary data forwarding: After successfully placing an order, you have the option of taking part in a marketing survey voluntarily, so we can continue to improve our services for you. Example: Newsletter despatch for partner companies. The legal basis is Article 6 para.1 lit. a of the GDPR ("Consent").</li>
<li>Assignment of claims (factoring): We offer the payment method AfterPay from Arvato Payment Solutions GmbH, GÃ¼tersloher Str. 123, 33415 Verl, Germany ("AfterPay"). If you decide to conclude your purchase with AfterPay as a payment method, your personal data shall be transmitted to AfterPay, for example: First and last name, date of birth, address (billing and delivery address), email address, telephone number, account number, billing information, credit card information (card number, CCV code, expiry date), direct debit information (IBAN, BIC). Your data shall only be transmitted to AfterPay after your express consent. The legal basis for the data transmission is Article 6 para.1 lit. a of the GDPR ("Consent"). Further information regarding data protection for AfterPay: <a href="https://www.afterpay.de/datenschutz" target="_blank">https://www.afterpay.de/datenschutz</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Criteria for the storage of personal data</strong></p>
<p>We process personal data in accordance with the legal basis stated in this declaration and store personal data. If the data is routinely no longer required to initiate a contract or fulfilment of the contract, it shall be deleted in accordance with the respective statutory retention period.</p>
<p><strong>8. Changes to the privacy policy </strong></p>
<p>For legal and/or company organisational reasons, changes or adjustments to our privacy policy may be required in the future, even at short notice. Please note the current version of our privacy policy.</p>

If you do not wish any processing of the Flash cookies, you must install a corresponding add-on, e.g. âBetter Privacy" for Mozilla Firefox or the Adobe-Flash-Killer-Cookie for Google Chrome. You can prevent the use of HTML5 storage objects by using private mode in your browser. In addition, we recommend that you regularly delete your cookies and the browser history manually.</p>
<p><strong>5. Use of our webshop</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to order in our webshop, for the conclusion of the contract it is necessary for you to provide your personal data (first and last name, address, email address, date of birth, telephone number), which we need for the processing of your order. Obligatory information which is necessary for the processing of the contracts is marked separately, further details are voluntary. We process the data provided by you to handle your order. For this purpose we can pass on your payment data to our own bank. The legal basis for this is Article 6 para.1 S.1 lit. b of the GDPR ("Contract performance").</p>
<p>You may voluntarily create a customer account that will allow us to store your subsequent data for further purchases, your past and current order information and your interaction with Delticom:</p>
<p>Your above mentioned customer data</p>
<p>Overview of your completed and current orders at Delticom with details of order number, brand, article name, profile, dimension, number, order date, delivery date, delivery status, details, etc.</p>
<p>Your last login data with date, day and time are displayed.</p>
<p>Costs of your order, billing address, delivery address, order history, information regarding scheduling and status, etc.</p>
<p>When you create an account under "My Account", the data you provide will be revocably stored. All other data, including your user account, can always be deleted in the customer area. The legal basis for the use is Article 6 para.1 S.1 lit. f of the GDPR ("Balance of interests").</p>
<p>We may also process the information you provide to inform you of other interesting products from our range or to send you emails with technical information. Due to trade and tax regulations, we are obligated to save your address, payment and order data for a period of ten years. However, we impose restrictions on processing, i.e. Your data shall only be used to comply with legal obligations.</p>
<p>The ordering process is encrypted to prevent unauthorised access to your personal data by third parties, especially financial data, .</p>
<p><strong>6. Use of social media</strong></p>
<p>We currently use the following social media plug-ins: Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube. We use the so-called two click solution. That means, when you visit our site, no personal data is initially passed on to the providers of the plug-ins. The provider of the plug-in is recognised by the respective logo. We give you the opportunity to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button. Only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it, will the plug-in provider receive the information that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online service. In addition, the data specified in this policy shall be transmitted. In the case of Facebook, according to the respective providers in Germany, the IP address is anonymised immediately after collection. By activating the plug-in, personal data is transmitted by you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (with US providers in the USA). As the plug-in provider carries out the data collection in particular by means of cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies before clicking on the greyed-out box by means of the security settings of your browser.</p>
<p>We have no influence on the collected data and data processing operations, nor are we aware of the full extent of data collection, the purpose of the processing, or the retention periods. We also have no information regarding the deletion of the data collected by the plug-in provider.</p>
<p>The plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or needs based design of the website. Such an evaluation is performed in particular (also for non-logged in users) for the display of needs based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the formation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise it. By means of the plug-ins we offer you the opportunity to interact with the social networks and other users, so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Article 6 para.1 S.1 lit. f of the GDPR ("Balance of interests").</p>
<p>The data transfer takes place regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there. If you are logged into the plug-in provider, your data collected by us shall be assigned directly to your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you press the activated button and for example, if you link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. We recommend logging out regularly after using a social network, but especially before activating the button, as this will prevent you from being mapped to your profile with the plug-in provider.</p>
<p>For more information on the purpose and extent of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider, please refer to the privacy statements of these providers shown below. There you will also find further information about your rights and the configuration options for the protection of your privacy.</p>

<p><strong>5. DoubleClick by Google</strong></p>
<p>This website continues to use the online marketing tool DoubleClick by Google. DoubleClick uses cookies to configure adverts that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports, or to prevent a user from seeing the same adverts multiple times. Google uses a cookie ID to determine which adverts are running in which browser and can prevent them from being displayed multiple times. Furthermore, DoubleClick uses cookie IDs to track conversions related to advert requests. This is the case if a user sees a DoubleClick advert and later goes to the website of the advertiser with the same browser and buys something there. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server. We have no control over the extent and the further use of the data, which are collected by the implementation of this tool by Google and inform you therefore according to our knowledge level: By the inclusion of DoubleClick, Google receives the information that you have accessed the relevant part of our website or have clicked on an advert from us. If you are registered in a service which is provided by Google, Google may associate the visit with your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a possibility that the provider will find and store your IP address.</p>
<p>You can prevent participation in this tracking process in several ways: a) by setting your browser software accordingly, in particular, the suppression of third party cookies will prevent you from receiving any third party advertisements; b) by disabling the cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain "www.googleadservices.com", <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a>, whereby this setting is deleted when you delete your cookies; c) by disabling the interest based adverts of the providers that are part of the "About Ads" self-regulation campaign via the link <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, whereby this setting is deleted when you delete your cookies; d) by permanent disabling in your browser Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome under the link <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin</a>. We inform you that in this case you may not be able to use all the features of this offer to their full extent.</p>
