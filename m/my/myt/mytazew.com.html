	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>My Tazew is committed to customer service and we intend to uphold 
		this by providing a private and secure browsing experience at My Tazew. The following policy will help you to understand how we will treat your 
		personal information. As we continue to improve our site and as we take 
		advantage of developments in technology, this policy may change from time to 
		time so please check this policy on an ongoing basis for revisions and updates.</p>
	<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
	<p> My Tazew collects information from our web site in several ways. 
		During registration, My Tazew asks for information such as your 
		name, email address, and phone number. Once you have submitted this information 
		and chosen a valid password, you will be able to take full advantage of 
		everything My Tazew has to offer. You may also be asked for 
		personal information when you report a problem with our site, or services; or, 
		if you otherwise contact My Tazew. Of course, we will require 
		credit card information, as well as billing information when you establish an 
		My Tazew account. My Tazew also collects information 
		using cookies, which are small pieces of information that are stored by your 
		browser on your computer's hard drive. This information allows us to 
		automatically link our customers to their personalized accounts. Most web 
		browsers automatically accept cookies. Please check your browser's guidelines 
		should you wish to prevent cookies. My Tazew is the sole owner of 
		the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this 
		information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this 
		statement. Information is collected with the sole purpose of providing My Tazew services.</p>
	<h3> Information Disclosure</h3>
	<p> When you are on the My Tazew site and are asked for personal 
		information, you are sharing that information with only My Tazew, 
		its agents and representatives. My Tazew will not disclose any of 
		your personally identifiable information except when we have your express 
		permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith 
		that the law requires it. My Tazew may also disclose account 
		information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this 
		information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against 
		someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally 
		or unintentionally) My Tazew's rights or property, other My Tazew users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 
		My Tazew will comply with the requests of all recognized legal 
		entities to aid in the stopping of spam, distribution of illicit sexual content 
		to minors, or any other illegal activity brought to our attention through such 
		channels.</p>
	<p>My Tazew may occasionally send you e-mail about products and 
		services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only My Tazew (or 
		agents or representatives working on behalf of My Tazew) will send 
		you these emails. You may unsubscribe from the service information updates 
		without any future correspondence or questions by filling out the <a href="/unsubscribe/">Opt-Out 
		Form</a>.</p>
