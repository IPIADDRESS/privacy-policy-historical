<p>The Isle of Man’s Data Protection Act 2002 has been drafted to meet the standards set out in the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and is similar to the UK’s Data Protection Act 1998. On 28 April 2004, the European Commission formally recognised that the legislation provides an adequate level of protection.</p>
<p class="p2">Please be aware that information we collect will be processed in the Isle of Man, British Isles, a jurisdiction in which the data protection laws may not offer the same level of protection as those in the country in which you reside. By using the Site or App and providing information to us, you consent to the transfer to and processing of data by MYZONE in the Isle of Man, British Isles and you also consent to the transfer to and processing of data by your facility in their jurisdiction (which is likely to be the jurisdiction in which you reside). If you wish to withdraw your consent for your facility to access your Personal Information (perhaps because you have left your facility and have moved to another jurisdiction) you should inform us in writing.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s3"><b>Do we use cookies?</b></span></h3>
<p>Yes (cookies are small files that a site transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) enabling us to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information).</p>
<p>We use cookies to help us remember and process site preferences so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We do not share cookies with third parties.</p>
<p>Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be “tracked” online.&nbsp; At this time, we do not modify your experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s3"><b>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</b></span></h3>
<p>We do not share your personally identifiable information with any other party (whether by way of sale, trade, or otherwise) except in the following situations:</p>
<p class="p4"><strong><span class="s3">Subcontractors.</span></strong><span class="s1"> From time to time we may share information with subcontractors that provide us with services.&nbsp; These services include, among other things, assisting us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you.&nbsp; Our subcontractors are required to keep the personal information that they receive confidential. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><strong><span class="s3">Your Facilities.</span></strong><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; If you register or use your MYZONE<sup>®</sup> belt at a facility (health club, community hub, social hub, school or employer etc.) or if our records indicate that the MYZONE<sup>®</sup> belt has been sold to such a facility, your information may be accessed by individuals engaged by those facilities (for example, so that they can deliver a service to you) and you expressly consent to your personal information being used in this manner. It must be noted that such individuals are not our employees or agents (except to the extent that they may collect in some situations consent to our privacy policies on our behalf) and you should satisfy yourself that the facility has procedures in place to protect your privacy (and, if applicable, the privacy of any child – see ‘Children’s Online Privacy’, below). To enable users to enjoy the MYZONE<sup>®</sup> experience it is mandatory and unavoidable for facilities to have access to personal information including the name, email address, gender, date of birth, belt ID, and maximum and resting heart rates of belt users. Facilities can also access data showing when belt users have participated in any class activity, the duration of such activity, and the number of calories burnt. In addition, facilities can access the names of your social connections linked with their facility and access the number of “likes” and the number of comments you have made against activities of other belt users. If you do not consent to facilities having access to such information you should not proceed with your belt registration. The facilities do not have access to any personal biometric data unless you permit them to have such access.</span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><strong><span class="s3">Distributors</span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>.</strong> Our products are sold through third party distributors.&nbsp; If you decide to purchase a product, in order for you to enter into an agreement with the distributor, and for the distributor to fulfill the agreement, we may transfer any information that you provide to us to the distributor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><strong><span class="s3">Payment Processors</span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>.</strong> We provide information to providers of merchant / transaction fulfilment services so that payment can be collected from you.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><strong>Business Transition.</strong>&nbsp;In the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, your information will be transferred to the acquiring company.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><strong><span class="s3">Sharing Your Information with Law Enforcement.</span></strong><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></b><span class="Apple-converted-space">We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity.&nbsp; In addition, we reserve the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that the release of your information may protect the safety or property of any person or entity.</span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><strong><span class="s3">Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law.</span></strong><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted by, law.&nbsp; This may include sharing your information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.</span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><strong><span class="s3">You may Permit other MYZONE</span><span class="s4"><sup>®</sup></span><span class="s3"> Users to Access Your Information.</span></strong><span class="s1"> You may choose to permit other MYZONE<sup>®</sup> users to access your activities, food diary, biometrics and (provided you are aged 18 or over) images. If coaches/trainers connected with a Facility wish to access this information (and your phone number) through their coach account, you will be advised by email and can choose to refuse such access.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Notwithstanding the above, we may provide anonymised (non-personally identifiable) information to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="p1">Managing Your Privacy Options</h3>
<p>We have provided you with a means of managing your privacy settings. You can update your default settings in the App and control what and with whom you share your Personal Information.</p>
<p>The default settings are as follows:</p>
<p>Allow my connections to see my “moves” data = ON (visible)</p>
<p>Allow my connections to see my photos = ON (visible)</p>
<p>Allow my connections to see all my connections = ON (visible)</p>
<p>Allow me to be viewed as a connection of a connection = ON (visible)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s3"><b>Security</b></span></h3>
<p>If you choose to purchase any of our products, credit card information will be collected by a third party payment processor which has represented to us that the payment data that you transfer is encrypted (turned into unidentifiable code) by a method known as SSL (secure sockets layer).</p>
<p class="p2">While we take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect data that you submit directly to us, remember that the Internet is a global communications vehicle open to threats, viruses and intrusions from others and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that we will be able to protect your information at all times and in all circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s3"><b>Children’s Online Privacy</b></span></h3>
<p>We are mindful that the belt and system will be attractive and of benefit to users under the age of 13 and it is our policy, regardless of the country in which the facility is located, to ensure that parents or teachers (if they are authorised and it is legal for them to do so) can monitor data collected in respect of such persons. We try to achieve this through adopting an approach which is compliant with the United States legislation known as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (‘COPPA’).</p>
<p>Our Site, App, products and services are all available to persons who are below 13 years of age.&nbsp; A parent or teacher (as advised to us) of any child who has not attained 13 years of age can review their child’s/student’s personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s information. If the parent or teacher wishes to exercise this right they should contact us in writing using the information below. We only collect personal information that is required to provide the service: <strong>please note that the removal of such personal information will render the belt and service inoperable</strong>.</p>
<p>The parent or teacher of any person aged below 13 years is required to consent to the collection and use of their child’s or student’s personal information at the time of registering a belt. Parents and teachers must communicate this consent through completion of a consent form which is available through us or our distributors. These consent forms must be verified as follows:(1) in the case of a parent, a Parental Consent Form in respect of the child must be completed and then verified by the facility in which the belt is registered; or (2) in the case of a teacher, an Educational Institution Consent Form must be completed and verified, through the education facility where the belt is registered, by providing in respect of that teacher, a Union Card, State Issued Teaching Certificate, Home Schooling Certificate, State Issued Preschool/Day-care Facility Certificate/License, Home Schooler Affidavit or IHIP Approval Letter from School District or State.</p>
<p>Parents and teachers (as applicable) will receive a copy of all email communications that are sent to their child or student, until such child or student has attained the age of 13. This will enable them to monitor data in respect of such children and/or students.</p>
