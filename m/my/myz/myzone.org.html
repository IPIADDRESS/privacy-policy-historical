    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="legal bold">Effective April 09, 2014</p>
    <p class="legal">Please read our Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing this website ("Site") or using our mobile application ("App") or other MYZONE product or service on any computer, mobile phone, tablet, console or other device (each a "Device") you consent to our Privacy Policy and to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In this Policy "we", "us" and "our" mean Myzone (defined below) and "you" means the individual who is accessing or using the Site or App.</p>
    <p class="legal bold underlined">Who are we?</p>
    <p class="legal">By "Myzone" we mean Myzone Limited and its subsidiaries and affiliates which include Myzone (UK) Limited, Myzone (Worldwide) Limited, Myzone Moves (UK) Limited and Myzone Moves (Worldwide) Limited. All these companies have their registered office at 29/31 Athol Street, Douglas, Isle of Man IM1 1LB, British Isles.</p>
    <p class="legal bold underlined">What information do we collect?</p>
    <p class="legal italic underlined">Regarding your use of the Myzone system</p>
    <p class="legal">a)	If you are a belt user:</p>
    <p class="legal">We collect information from you when you register your Myzone belt on this Site or via the App.</p>
    <p class="legal">When registering your Myzone belt on this Site or via the App, you will be asked to enter information including your name, email address, date of birth, gender, height, weight, phone number and member/employee number (if applicable). In addition you may provide (either through manually inputting data or through the use of compatible devices) biometric data such as blood pressure, bone mass, fat mass, basal metabolic rate, waist circumference, fat free mass, total body water, visceral fat and metabolic age.</p>
    <p class="legal">If you have installed the App on a Device you may also capture images to record food consumption and, (for users aged 18 or over only), body shape.</p>
    <p class="legal">We also collect information passively from the Myzone belt, including heart rate data.</p>
    <p class="legal">b)	If you are a licensed Myzone facility:</p>
    <p class="legal">We collect information from you if you are a Myzone facility (a health club, community hub, school or employer etc. which operates the Myzone system). Myzone facilities will be asked to provide contact details of relevant staff including their name, telephone number and email address.</p>
    <p class="legal">c)	If you are or wish to be a Myzone distributor:</p>
    <p class="legal">If you wish to become a Myzone distributor we may request you to complete an application form which requires you to provide particular information such as your name, contact details (including address, email address and telephone number) and business related data. We will retain this information if your application is approved and you become a Myzone distributor; otherwise we will delete it.</p>
    <p class="legal italic underlined">Regarding use of the online shop</p>
    <p class="legal">We will collect the following information about you:</p>
    <p class="legal">1.	Your name</p>
    <p class="legal">2.	Postal Address</p>
    <p class="legal">3.	Email address</p>
    <p class="legal">4.	Telephone number (including mobile number)</p>
    <p class="legal">In order to complete your transaction we may refer you to a third party’s website, or a third party’s payment portal, that will collect information about your payment card.  The information that you submit to them is not transmitted to us, and you should review any privacy statements issued by the third party provider before submitting your information.</p>
    <p class="legal bold underlined">What do we use your information for?</p>
    <p class="legal italic underlined">Regarding the Myzone belt</p>
    <p class="legal">The primary reason for requesting information is to personalise your experience and to allow you to enjoy the full benefits of being able to monitor your physical activity through measuring, recording and displaying your heart rate while using the Myzone belt.</p>
    <p class="legal">We request information from you if you are a Myzone facility so that we can register you as a Myzone site owner, allowing you access to the names of users who have registered belts at your facility so you can communicate with them, and to enhance belt users’ experience of the Myzone system.</p>
    <p class="legal">We request information from you if you wish to become a Myzone distributor so that we can process your application. If you are a Myzone distributor any information gathered either through you completing an application or through our processing of your application is used to maintain our business relationship with you.</p>
    <p class="legal">The information we collect from you may also be used in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To improve our Site or App (we continually strive to improve our Site and App based on the information and feedback we receive from you)</li>
        <li>To improve customer service (your information helps us to respond more effectively to your customer service requests and support needs)</li>
        <li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or similar function.  (Note: you can unsubscribe from receiving marketing communications at any time by contacting us in writing.)</li>
        <li>To send periodic emails. The email address you provide will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your Myzone belt or matters which we believe may be of interest.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="legal italic underlined">Regarding the online shop</p>
    <p class="legal">The primary reason for requesting information is to fulfil your order.</p>
    <p class="legal bold underlined">How do we protect your personal information?</p>
    <p class="legal">Myzone Limited is registered as a data controller in the Isle of Man under the Data Protection Act 2002 and has Notification Number N002814. Accordingly, any personal information we hold must be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used fairly and lawfully</li>
        <li>Used for specific and lawful purposes, in a manner that is compatible with those purposes</li>
        <li>Adequate, relevant and not excessive</li>
        <li>Accurate and where necessary kept up to date</li>
        <li>Kept for no longer than necessary</li>
        <li>Used in accordance with the rights of individuals under the Act</li>
        <li>Kept secure to avoid unauthorised or unlawful use, accidental loss, or damage</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="legal">Advice and a copy of the Register are available from the Office of the Data Protection Controller <a href="http://www.gov.im/odps" class="legalA" target="blank">www.gov.im/odps</a>.</p>
    <p class="legal">The Isle of Man’s Data Protection Act 2002 has been drafted to meet the standards set out in the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and is similar to the UK's Data Protection Act 1998. On 28 April 2004, the European Commission formally recognised that the legislation provides an adequate level of protection.</p>
    <p class="legal bold underlined">Do we use cookies?</p>
    <p class="legal">Yes (Cookies are small files that a site transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables us to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information).</p>
    <p class="legal">We use cookies to help us remember and process site preferences so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We do not share cookies with third parties.</p>
    <p class="legal">Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be "tracked" online.  At this time we do not modify your experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.</p>
    <p class="legal bold underlined">Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</p>
    <p class="legal">We do not share your personally identifiable information with any other party (whether by way of sale, trade, or otherwise) except in the following situations:</p>
    <p class="legal"><span class="underlined">Subcontractors</span>. From time to time we may share information with subcontractors that provide us with services.  These services include, among other things, assisting us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you.  We require our subcontractors to agree to keep confidential all personal information they receive from us.</p>
    <p class="legal"><span class="underlined">Your Facilities</span>.  If you register or use your Myzone belt at a facility (health club, community hub, school or employer etc.), your information may be accessed by individuals engaged by those facilities (for example, so that they can deliver a service to you) and you expressly consent to your personal information being used in this manner. It must be noted that such individuals are not our employees or agents (except to the extent that they may in some situations obtain your consent to our privacy policies on our behalf) and you should satisfy yourself that the facility has procedures in place to protect your privacy (and, if applicable, the privacy of any child – see ‘Children’s Online Privacy’, below).</p>
    <p class="legal">To enable users to enjoy the Myzone experience it is mandatory and unavoidable for facilities to have access to personal information including the name, email address, gender, date of birth, belt ID, and maximum and resting heart rates of belt users. Facilities can also access data showing when belt users have participated in any class activity, the duration of such activity, and the amount of calories burnt. If you do not consent to facilities having access to such information you should not proceed with your belt registration. The facilities do not have access to any personal biometric data unless you permit them to have such access.</p>
    <p class="legal"><span class="underlined">Distributors</span>. Our products are sold through third party distributors.  If you decide to purchase a product, in order for you to enter into an agreement with the distributor, and for the distributor to fulfil the agreement, we may transfer any information that you provide to us to the distributor.</p>
    <p class="legal"><span class="underlined">Payment processors</span>. We provide information to providers of merchant / transaction fulfilment services so that payment can be collected from you.</p>
    <p class="legal"><span class="underlined">Business Transition</span>. In the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, your information will be transferred to the acquiring company.</p>
    <p class="legal"><span class="underlined">Sharing Your Information with Law Enforcement</span>.  We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity.  In addition, we reserve the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that the release of your information may protect the safety or property of any person or entity.</p>
    <p class="legal"><span class="underlined">Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law</span>.  We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted by, law.  This may include sharing your information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.</p>
    <p class="legal"><span class="underlined">You may Permit other Myzone Users to Access Your Information</span>. You may choose to permit other Myzone users to access your activities, food diary, biometrics and (provided you are aged 18 or over) body images. If coaches/trainers connected with a Facility wish to access this information (and your phone number) through their coach account you will be advised by email and can choose to refuse such access.  Myzone users can allow friends that use Myzone to see their activities if a ‘friendship request’ is sent and accepted.</p>
    <p class="legal"><span class="underlined">References and Due Diligence</span>. If you apply to become a Myzone distributor you expressly consent to your personal information being used so that we can process your application which may involve due diligence enquiries.</p>
    <p class="legal">Notwithstanding the above, we may provide anonymised (non-personally identifiable) information to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
    <p class="legal bold underlined">Security</p>
    <p class="legal">If you choose to purchase any of our products, credit card information will be collected by a third party payment processor which has represented to us that the payment data that you transfer is encrypted (turned into unidentifiable code) by a method known as SSL (secure sockets layer).</p>
    <p class="legal">While we take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect data that you submit directly to us, remember that the Internet is a global communications vehicle open to threats, viruses and intrusions from others and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that we will be able to protect your information at all times and in all circumstances.</p>
    <p class="legal bold underlined">Children’s Online Privacy</p>
    <p class="legal">We are mindful that the belt and system will be attractive and of benefit to users under the age of 13 and it is our policy, regardless of the country in which the facility is located, to ensure that parents or teachers (if they are authorised and it is legal for them to do so) can monitor data collected in respect of such persons. We try to achieve this through adopting an approach which is compliant with the United States legislation known as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (‘COPPA’).</p>
    <p class="legal">Our Site, App, products and services are all available to persons who are below 13 years of age.  A parent or teacher(as advised to us) of any child who has not attained 13 years of age can review their child's/student’s personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's information. If the parent or teacher wishes to exercise this right they should contact us in writing using the information below. We only collect personal information that is required to provide the service: <span class="bold">please note that the removal of such personal information will render the belt and service inoperable</span>.</p>
    <p class="legal">The parent or teacher of any person aged below 13 years is required to consent to the collection and use of their child's or student’s personal information at the time of registering a belt. Parents and teachers must communicate this consent through completion of a consent form which is available through us or our distributors. These consent forms must be verified as follows:(1) in the case of a parent, a Parental Consent Form in respect of the child must be completed and then verified by the facility in which the belt is registered;  or (2) in the case of a teacher, an Educational Institution Consent Form must be completed and verified, through the education facility where the belt is registered, by providing in respect of that teacher, a Union Card, State Issued Teaching Certificate, Home Schooling Certificate, State Issued Preschool/Day-care Facility Certificate/License, Home Schooler Affidavit or IHIP Approval Letter from School District or State.</p>
    <p class="legal">Parents and teachers (as applicable) will receive a copy of all email communications that are sent to their child or student, until such child or student has attained the age of 13. This will enable them to monitor data in respect of such children and/or students.</p>
    <p class="legal bold underlined">Online Privacy Policy Only</p>
    <p class="legal">This online privacy policy applies only to information collected through a Site or Device and not to information collected offline.</p>
