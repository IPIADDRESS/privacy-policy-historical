<p><strong>Privacy Policy<br>Effective: May 12, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the web site (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) of Zeo, Inc. (“<strong>Zeo</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” and/or “<strong>our</strong>”). Through the Site, including without limitation the corporate-branded area and the area of the Site made available to registered owners of the Zeo Personal Sleep Coach (the “<strong>MyZeo Coach</strong>”), you will have access to an educational tool and motivational program that helps you learn about your sleep and which habits and behaviors may be keeping you from enjoying the sleep that you need (collectively, the “<strong>Zeo Services</strong>”). The Zeo Services are neither a medical device nor a medical program and are not intended for the diagnosis and/or treatment of sleep disorders.</p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us at Zeo. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our policy with respect to personally identifiable data (“<strong>Personal Data</strong>”) and other information that is collected from those who use our Site.</p>
<p><u><strong>Information We Collect:</strong></u></p>
<p>When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through Registration:</strong> We collect Personal Data from you when you register with the Site and create an account.&nbsp; Except in connection with your order to purchase a product through the Site, we do not collect any credit card or other financial account information, driver’s license numbers and/or social security numbers. </p>
<p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through Other Use of the Site:&nbsp;</strong> We also collect Personal Data from you when you access the Zeo Services and/or other parts of the Site and elect to provide Personal Data through the Site.&nbsp; For example, when you use the MyZeo Coach, we will collect sleep data that you upload to the Site and information that you input in your sleep journal, such as details regarding your sleeping environment, your feelings, behaviors and other factors that may impact your sleep.</p>
<p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Zeo and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>At no time shall Personal Data collected from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any information or materials derived from such Personal Data be deemed to be an electronic health record or an electronic medical record for any purpose whatsoever under any law or regulation, including without limitation for purposes of compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. <br></strong><br><strong>Other Information:</strong> When you access the Zeo Services through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot be used to specifically identify you. Zeo may store such information itself and/or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Zeo affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><strong><u>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information.<br></u></strong>Zeo uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We may use your Personal Data for the purpose for which it was provided, including without limitation for the purposes described further below:</p>

</li><li><strong><em>Surveys, Contests and Other Special Offers:</em></strong> From time to time, we may offer our users the opportunity to participate in surveys, contest and other special offers.&nbsp; If you elect to participate in these services, you will need to provide certain Personal Data. <br><strong><em></em></strong>

</li><li><strong><em>Research and Data Analysis:</em></strong> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Sites and the Zeo Services, Zeo often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on&nbsp; de-identified Personal Data and other information provided to us.

This information will not identify you personally <br><strong><em></em></strong>
</li><li><strong><em>Service Improvement: </em></strong>We may use your Personal Data, aggregated Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Zeo Services. <br><em><strong></strong></em>

</li><li><em><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong></em> Zeo, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, and maintaining databases. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.&nbsp; <br><em><strong></strong></em>
</li><li><em><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong></em> Zeo may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Zeo, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. <br><em><strong></strong></em>
</li><li><em><strong>Third Parties Upon Opt-In: </strong></em>If you opt-in to allow us to share your Personal Data with third parties because you agree to be contacted by such third parties with respect to products, services and/or events that may be of interest to you, your Personal Data with such third parties. <br><em><strong></strong></em>

<p><u><strong>Your Choices.<br></strong></u>You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data. However, if you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain areas of the Site and/or certain Zeo Services.&nbsp; For example, you will not be able to use the Zeo Services without creating an account, establishing a sleep profile and providing the necessary registration information.&nbsp; You will have the choice as to whether or not you wish to be contacted by us and/or by any third parties with offers for products, services and/or events that may be of interest to you.
