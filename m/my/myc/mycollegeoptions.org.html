          Welcome! This Privacy Policy describes how My College Options, Inc. (<strong>“myCollegeOptions,” “we,” “us,” “our,”</strong> etc.) collects, uses, 
           and shares information about you, including the choices myCollegeOptions offers with respect to that information, in connection with (a) the 
           “Personal Profile Information” (defined below) you provide during "Registration” (defined below), and (b) your use of the “myOptions Program” 
           (defined below).
        </p>
        <p><b>
            <u>Registration</u></b> Registration for the myOptions Program consists of the completion and submission of an online or offline form distributed to U.S. secondary 
           schools; OR directly accessing the Program online via the Service (defined below). By registering for the Program, you consent to our collection, 
           use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy, and any additional privacy statements that may be posted on 
           an applicable part of a Registration form or Service information collection page. If you do not agree and consent, do not participate in the 
           myOptions Program or access or use the Service. Our program is entirely voluntary and not required by your school.
        </p>
        <p><b>
            <u>Personal Profile Information</u></b> Your Personal Profile Information means the Personal Information and Demographic Information you provide when registering for the Program AND 
           any updates you make to your Personal Profile Information online via the Service.
        </p>
        <p><b>
            <u>The myOptions Program</u></b> The myOptions Program (<strong>“Program”</strong>) refers to the Registration process, subsequent updates to your Personal Profile Information, use of the  <a href="http://myoptions.org" target="_blank">myoptions.org</a>, <a href="http://mycollegeoptions.org" target="_blank">mycollegeoptions.org</a>,  <a href="http://admitted.ly" target="_blank">admitted.ly</a> and/or <a href="http://admittedly.com" target="_blank">admittedly.com</a> websites, the myOptions mobile app, and any  other online service location (e.g., website or mobile app) that posts a link to this Privacy Policy (<strong>“Service”</strong>), regardless of 
           how you access or use it, whether via computer, mobile device, consumer electronics device, or otherwise. The Program includes mycollegeoptions, 
           mycareeroptions, myscholarshipoptions and such other program components as we may add from time to time.

           and applications.
        </p>
        <p><b>
            <u>Our Data Practices</u></b> The most important benefit of registering for the Program is that we use and share your information to help you connect with colleges, universities 
           and other providers of Education-related Products and Services (defined below) so you can receive information and resources directly from them and 
           through this program. Information you and your family may receive includes information from colleges and universities, as well as other

                  The primary mission of myCollegeOptions is to facilitate connections between registered students and accredited colleges and universities. 
                   These institutions can access student profile information and communicate with students directly and/or reach out through the Service itself.

                <p>
                  Any other education-related organizations wishing to connect with registered users of the program are individually reviewed to determine 
                   whether or not they offer a “redeeming educational value” AND that they fit in one of the following approved categories defined within the 
                   Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and other applicable law:

            <p>
              From time to time, our Service may include co-branded pages, or sections of a page, related to one of our marketing partners. We will try to show 
               clearly, by placing our marketing partner's name or logo in a prominent place or otherwise, whether a page, or section of a page, is co-branded. 
               If you provide your information on or through one of these co-branded opportunities, the information you submit (which may include pulling from 
               your Personal Profile Information if you so elect) may be shared by you with that marketing partner, and it may associate its own Tracking 
               Technologies with you. In such case, that party's privacy policy and its terms and conditions of use apply to you with respect to that third party. 
               Some of these marketing partners may be commercial marketers, or have relationships with commercial marketers, so by sharing your information with 
               them, you may be consenting to receive direct marketing that is not restricted to Educational-related Products and Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Service may also include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, 
               applications or services operated by third parties (<strong>“Third Party Service(s)”</strong>). These Third-Party Services may use their Tracking 
               Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third party 
               social networks (<strong>“Social Features”</strong>). Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos 
               between the Service and a Third Party Service; “liking” or “sharing” our content; logging in to the Service using your Third Party Service account 
               (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third Party Service (e.g., to pull or push 
               information to or from the Service). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access 
               to may be publicly displayed on the Service or by the Third Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service 
               that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with myCollegeOptions in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in 
               connection with the Service or otherwise by us. Also, both myCollegeOptions and the third party may have access to certain information about you and 
               your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Service may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service, and/or on third-party 
               services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interests based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the Internet over time, 
               sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” (<strong>“Interest-based Advertising”</strong>), 
               which may include sending you an ad on a third party service after you have left the Service (i.e., “retargeting”).  See <a href="#sec10">Section 10</a> for information on certain choices offered by third parties regarding Interest-based Advertising.
            </p>

              Our Service may use Google Analytics and other Service Providers for analytics services. These analytics services may use cookies and other

               (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. 
               (or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling 
               statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other Internet usage.  See <a href="#sec10">Section 10</a> for information on certain choices offered by Google Analytics and other third parties regarding analytics.
            </p>
            <p>Except to the extent we combine information from Service Providers, Third-Party Services or other third parties with Personal Profile Information,  in which case we will treat the combined information as Personal Profile Information under this Privacy Policy (See <a href="#sec2">Section 2</a>.C), data obtained  by us from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to our limitations regarding Personal Profile Information under 
               this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, the information collected, stored and shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and 
               practices, including whether they continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible 
               to others on third-party services.

              We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties, including without 
               limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services associated with the Service, and encourage you to familiarize yourself with  and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.

Monitoring may 
               result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through our Service. If you do not consent to these

              The myOptions Program is based in the U.S. and the information we and our Service Providers collect is governed by U.S. law. If you are 
               accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Service may be transferred to, 
               processed, stored and used in the U.S. Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those of your country of residence. Your 
               use of the Service or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, 
               sharing and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the U.S. as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

            <p>
              The Service is intended for a general audience and not directed to children less than 13 years of age. The Program does not intend to collect 
               personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (<strong>“COPPA”</strong>) (<strong>Children’s Personal 
               Information</strong>) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected Children’s  Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact us <a href="mailto:peggy@mycollegeoptions.org">here</a> and we will  remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.
            </p>
            <p>Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who posted content or information on the  Service, can request removal by contacting myCollegeOptions <a href="mailto:peggy@mycollegeoptions.org">here</a>, detailing where the content  or information is posted and attesting that you posted it. myCollegeOptions will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post 
               from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This 
               removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished or archived content by 
               search engines and others that myCollegeOptions does not control.

California minors  should see “Children” at <a href="#sec8">Section 8</a> regarding removal of certain content they have posted on the Service. We will make  good faith efforts to make requested changes in the myCollegeOptions then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always 
               possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or postings from our databases and residual and/or cached data may 
               remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably 
               necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

                   in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately.
                   Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5

For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website&nbsp; <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Please be aware that if you disable  or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service, your ability to limit 
                   browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by 
                   uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.

                  Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there 
                   is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many online services, we currently 
                   do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,”  you can visit&nbsp;<a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party  information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. One way to potentially identify  cookies on our Site is to add the free&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ghostery.com/" target="_blank">Ghostery plug-in</a>&nbsp;to your browser, which according to  Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the websites (but not mobile apps) you visit and

Please be aware that,  even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. 
                   Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean

                   emails to click on the unsubscribe link, or if available by changing your communication preferences by logging onto your account. 
                   Please note that your opt-out is limited to the email address and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. If you opt-out of only 
                   certain communications, other subscription communications may continue. Even if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, 
                   we may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, 
                   servicing, or our ongoing business relations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By providing a phone number you consent to be contacted at that number, including promotional phone calls related to us and educational 
                   related companies we think you may find of interest, and administrative texts regarding the Program or Service that do not include 
                   advertising messages.  For promotional calls, you may opt-out of pre-recorded calls by following the automated prompts and for live 
                   promotional calls you may opt-out by telling the operator.  Such an opt-out will prospectively end our promotional calls to you, and 
                   we will no longer share your number with educational related companies for their promotional calling, unless you subsequently opt back in. 
                   However, you will need to opt-out of any educational related companies that received your number prior to your opting out with us 
                   directly with those third parties.  For text messages, you may withdraw consent by replying “STOP” to our texts, but if you thereafter 
                   provide a number to receive texts you will have opted back in.  We may offer separate text subscription programs for different purposes, 
                   in which case you must opt-out of each one separately.  If you have provided multiple numbers, you must opt-out of each number separately. 
                   These calls and texts may be made using autodialers and/or pre-recorded messages. You are not required to consent as a condition of 
                   purchasing any property, goods or services and no purchase is necessary to subscribe. Calls from or to us may be recorded; if you do not 
                   consent to call recording, discontinue the call.

              California’s “Shine the Light” law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are 
               shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. 
               Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers 
               to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We provide California residents with the option to opt-out of sharing “personal information” as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” 
               law with third parties for such third parties’ own direct marketing purposes. California residents may exercise that opt-out, and/or  request information about our compliance with the “Shine the Light” law by contacting us&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@mycollegeoptions.org">here</a>&nbsp; or by sending a letter to My College Options, Inc., 3651 NE Ralph Powell Rd., Lee’s Summit, MO 64064 (Attn: Privacy Coordinator/Legal 
               Compliance). Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street
