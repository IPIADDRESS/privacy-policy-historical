<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.
MyCallBot and its authorized agents automatically receive and record "traffic data"
on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie
information, and the page you requested.
</p>

<h3>Communications from the Site</h3>

<p>
  Generally, MyCallBot does not initiate communication with users. Service
  related announcements will be made through the site itself on its homepage or
  similarly recognizable location.
</p>

<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<p>
  We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release
  is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our
  <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> and other policies; or to
  protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our employees, our
  users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies
  and organizations for fraud and risk protection.
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>
  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for
  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the
  information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you
  submit while on our site.
</p>

<p>
  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies
  to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires
  when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for
  an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following
  directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
</p>

<p>
  Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
  enhance the experience on our site.
</p>

<p>
  If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some
  areas of our site will be limited.
</p>

<p>
  Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We
  have no access to or control over these cookies.
</p>

<p>
  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by MyCallBot only and does
  not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
</p>

<h3>Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms</h3>

<p>
  If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware
  that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read,
  collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send
  you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally
  identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
</p>

<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p>
  This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled
  by MyCallBot. Please be aware that we, MyCallBot, are not responsible for
  the privacy practices of such other sites.
</p>

<p>
  We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy
  statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable
  information.
</p>

<p>
  This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.
</p>

<h3>Children Under 18 Years of Age</h3>

<p>
  MyCallBot does not specifically collect information about children. If we
  learn that MyCallBot has collected information from a child under the age of
  13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
</p>

<h3>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h3>

<p>
  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this
  privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that
  you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
  circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
</p>

<p>
  We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please
  review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will
  notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
