        <p><b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
        <p>This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. We will notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new policy on this website. Review our Privacy Policy regularly so that you can stay informed of our practices, as they may change in the future.</p>
        <p>By using our services or submitting information, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Your assent to these practices is essential for us to provide our services. Similarly, we need you to provide accurate personal information so that you can be contacted. You can opt-out and decide not to provide the requested personal information. However, by doing so, you will not receive the information and/or service you are requesting.</p>
        <p>The personal information we collect includes name, business name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number, EIN, user name, password, and demographic information such as gender and income level. Other personal information that you may submit is clearly labeled at the time you submit it. We use the information that we collect to provide our services, to contact you regarding new offers, and to improve our site. We also use this information—directly, indirectly, and in combination with data we purchase from their parties—to introduce you to the informational, service, and/or product offerings of others. We do this by selling, licensing, transferring, and/or sharing your personal information with third parties who want to contact you regarding other informational, service, and/or product offerings in which they hope you will be interested. Once a third-party obtains your personal information, its subsequent use is controlled by the business practices of the third party, which is beyond our control. Note, however, that your payment information is used only for order processing purposes, and that your social security number and/or EIN are used only for tax reporting purposes.</p>
           <p>When registering and submitting your information on this site you agree to receiving third party newsletters from CarbonCopyPRO or trusted third party offers. There is no cost to receive this newsletter(s). You can unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email.</p>
        <p>We automatically collect certain information from visitors to, and members of, the site, such as Internet addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit page, operating system, timestamps, and clickstream data. We also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our site so that we can constantly improve the quality of the services we provide.</p>
        <p>If you pay for anything on our site using a credit or debit card, we collect the personal information needed to complete the transaction. This information includes your name, card number, and other necessary information, all of which is clearly labeled on the form you use to submit payment. We use an unaffiliated, credit card processing company to process your payment. We transfer your payment information—and you authorize us to do so—to this company solely for this purpose. The company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
        <p>Anything you send us, post on our site, or use with our service, such as emails or voice recordings, or if other users or third parties send us anything about your activities or postings, we will collect such information into a file specific to you. We use information in the file that we maintain for you, and other information that we obtain from your use of the services, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our customer agreements.<br>
            <br>
          We take measures to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We carefully limit access to the database in which your personal information is stored. Additionally, we require any third party with which we sell, license, transfer, and/or otherwise share your personal information to enter into binding legal agreements, which permits us to audit the ways in which the third parties are using your personal information.</p>
        <p>We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. We may also (and you authorize us to) disclose personal information about you to credit agencies, collection agencies, and/or merchant database agencies, as we deem necessary</p>
        <p>Contact us at the address below if you want us to change or delete any information that we have about you. We will respond to your request to access, update, or delete your information within ten (10) business days. Before we are able to provide you with any information, correct any inaccuracies, or delete any information, however, we may ask you to verify your identity.<br>
