<font size="3"><b>PRIVACY POLICY FOR MYCITY.COM</b></font>
<br>
MyCity.com is committed to protecting your privacy. We encourage you to
review this privacy policy to better understand our views and
practices, and how they pertain to you as a member of MyCity.com's Web
service. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to
MyCity.com via e-mail at <a href="mailto:CustomerCare@mycity.com">CustomerCare@mycity.com</a>, or by snail mail to: <strong>10559 Jefferson Boulevard, Suite C, Culver City CA 90232</strong>
</font><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>What information does the MyCity.com site gather and track?</b>
MyCity.com strives to provide our LOCALS with a superior, personalized
and customized Internet experience. To do so, MyCity.com gathers
information about each of our members' geographic location, personal
interests, and preferences. As part of the MyCity.com registration
process, we will ask you to provide individually identifiable
information such as your first name, e-mail address, and zip code. As
you continue to move throughout the service, additional personalization
features will enable you to further customize content areas or topics
of specific interest to you. </font></p><p>

<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">We also monitor and catalog
traffic patterns throughout the MyCity.com site. We accomplish this
through a feature of your browser called a "cookie," which in turn
assigns a random number, or "User ID," to your browser. Cookies, by
themselves, cannot be used to isolate the identity of any single user.
Your MyCity.com User ID only identifies your computer. Unless you
specifically tell us, MyCity.com will never know who you are, even
though we assign your computer a cookie. Most browsers are initially
set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser
either to notify you when you've received a cookie, or to refuse to
accept cookies. You should understand that certain areas of the
MyCity.com site will not function properly if you set your browser to
refuse cookies. </font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Companies, which purchase
advertising on the MyCity.com service, also have the ability to assign
their cookie to your computer, in a process which MyCity.com does not
control. But since cookies aren't able to identify individuals (you'll
be just a number to them). </font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>How does MyCity.com use this information?</b>
We hope to make MyCity.com the starting point for all your local online
needs. More importantly, we want to deliver a compelling online
experience that will keep you coming back to visit the service again
and again. MyCity.com uses the information supplied to us as a means to
personalize portions of the service. Some of these personalized
services are made available directly by MyCity.com, while others are
offered by our content partners. In addition, we analyze and evaluate
member preferences, comments, and criticisms of MyCity.com's offerings
in order to make improvements to the present and future versions of the
service. </font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">To help our advertisers better
understand our Local's preferences and interests, MyCity.com provides
summary or aggregate - not individual - reports on a regular basis. (An
example of the type of information provided in a summary report might
be, "40,000 people clicked on Advertisement 'X' today and of those
people, 50% had previously indicated they were interested in local
sports"). MyCity.com's advertisers use this information to determine
the effectiveness of their creative and media investments. </font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">MyCity.com automatically sends
all registered Locals an introductory e-mail which confirms the Local's
username and password and provides information on contacting
MyCity.com's member service and support staff. In addition, at your
discretion, we will send you the MyCity.com Newsletter, which provides
you with information about new products, services, or special
promotions. In every such e-mail, we will also include instructions on
how to unsubscribe to future communications of this type.
</font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">MyCity.com reserves the right to
share or transfer information to 3rd parties for marketing
opportunities, and when required by law.
</font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Will MyCity.com disclose any of my personal information?</b>Individually
identifiable information provided to MyCity.com is used throughout the
service to provide a personalized experience for our members. We
reserve the right to share and transfer data to 3rd parties for
marketing opportunities, as well as share data with our content
partners. MyCity.com retains no responsibility or liability for privacy
policies of our content partners
</font></p><p>

<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Companies that purchase
advertising on MyCity.com may track your navigation to and from their
sites and collect aggregate information about you when an ad is
displayed or when you click on their ads. MyCity.com does not control
this collection of information, nor do we monitor the use of this
information once our advertisers obtain it. You should contact these
advertisers directly if you have questions about their use of this
information. Additionally, MyCity.com does not control the information
collection and distribution policies on sites outside of the MyCity.com
service. </font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">As part of our
community-building tools, MyCity.com allows members to interact and
participate in various chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news
groups. Please be aware that any information disclosed in a chat room
or news group, or on a message board, becomes public information.
Members should exercise serious caution when deciding to disclose
individually identifiable information in one of these areas. Your
personal privacy is important to us; however, MyCity.com cannot ensure
the protection or security of information disclosed within these areas.
</font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">In addition, if you choose to
make a purchase through an online store or service linked from
MyCity.com, be aware that any information given, such as a credit card
number or home address, will be received by the company operating the
store. These merchants have separate and distinct privacy and data
collection practices. MyCity.com retains no responsibility or liability
for the privacy policies of these online stores. To obtain more
information about an individual vendor's policy on privacy, please
visit their homepage and review their privacy statement before making a
purchase decision. </font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>What are MyCity.com's opt-out features?</b>
MyCity.com's policy on communications directed to our members is very clear:<br>
You can tell us if you don't want to receive communication from
MyCity.com, such as MyCity.com's e-mail newsletters announcing
contests, new features, or offerings from our content partners, when
you first provide the information to MyCity.com, or simply by replying
to the e-mail with "Unsubscribe" written in the subject line. </font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Any modifications to this policy
will be posted in this space. We welcome any questions or comments you
have; please direct them to <a href="mailto:CustomerCare@mycity.com">CustomerCare@mycity.com</a>.
</font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>What Is MyCity.com's policy towards children?</b>

MyCity.com takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of
young people using our services. The MyCity.com site does not knowingly
collect information about children and the majority of our site is not
specifically directed to children. We believe that children should get
their parents' consent before giving out any personal information. We
encourage you to participate in your child's experience in cyberspace
and to review our important safety tips before your child explores the
Internet. </font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">MyCity.com recommends that
parents and kids try the "Family" section of the site together. Kids
should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal
information to MyCity.com, or to anyone online for that matter. </font></p><p>
