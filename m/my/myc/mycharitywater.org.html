            <br>
			When you visit our website, you may provide us with personal information (such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone numbers and/or credit/debit card information) that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is collected on an individual basis for various purposes. These purposes include registering to receive e-mail newsletters or other materials, requesting further information from us about projects and services, donating to us, ordering merchandise, making requests, submitting a form on our website, or simply asking a question.

            <br>
			charity: water does not sell, rent, give-away or share its e-mail addresses or other information with outside sources.
            <br>
            <br> 
			Should any material changes be made to the ways in which we use personally identifiable information, charity: water will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain e-mail consent from you. We will also post the changes to our use of personally identifiable information on our site at least 30 days prior to a change.
			<br>
			<br>
			<span class="body_big_dark_2">Our Commitment to Data Security</span>
