		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>How Long do we Retain your Information?</strong></span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We retain personal information we collect from you for as long as we: (i) have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so in connection with the purposes set out at “How Does Beachbody Use the Information It Collects?” above (for example to process your information whilst you are a customer and afterwards in order to deal with complaints and queries); or (ii) where required by law (for example we are required to keep financial records for a certain period under VAT and accounting rules).&nbsp;</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information</strong><br>
		Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
	<p>

	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><u>Effective Date</u>: May 24, 2018</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This Cookie Notice explains how Beachbody UK Ltd. (“<strong>Beachbody</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) uses cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our websites or applications on mobile or connected devices.&nbsp; It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong><br>
		Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.&nbsp; Cookies are widely used by many companies and website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Cookies set by Beachbody are called "first party cookies".&nbsp; Cookies set by parties other than Beachbody are called "third party cookies".&nbsp; Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content and analytics).&nbsp; The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Why Do We Use Cookies?</strong><br>
		We use first party and third party cookies. Cookies help us manage and report on your interaction with our websites or mobile applications. Through cookies, we are able to collect information that we use to improve our websites and mobile applications, and improve your overall experience on them. For example, through cookies, we can keep count of return visits to our website or our advertisers' or partners' websites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, authenticate your login credentials, and manage multiple instances of our websites in a single browser. We may also collect other data through cookies, such as the page or website that referred you to us, the date and time you visited us, and your current IP address.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may be able to remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your browser's "help" section.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our websites. Third parties serve cookies through our websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Some of the first and third party cookies we commonly serve through our websites and the purposes they perform are described directly below. Please note this list is not intended to be exhaustive, but is intended to illustrate primary reasons for certain types of cookies set by Beachbody and third parties on our websites and applications. Also, the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific website you visit. Since we are always making improvements to our websites and applications to better serve you, the list of companies named below may change from time to time. We will take commercially reasonable efforts to update this Cookie Notice as frequently as possible to reflect the most accurate information.</span></span></p>

		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What About Other Tracking Technologies, Like Web Beacons?</strong><br>
		Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website. We also collect information through the use of other, similar technologies, such as "pixel tags" on our websites and in e-mail messages we may send to you which may be placed by us or a third party with whom we partner. “Pixels”, also known as "Web beacons," are tiny graphic files or code snippets, not visible to the human eye, that can be included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages and web pages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail programme, the recipient's computer or device will communicate with our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with the recipient's e-mail address, the date and time the recipient viewed the e-mail message, the fact that the recipient's e-mail client is capable of receiving HTML-encoded e-mail, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag may also see or read cookies. Beachbody may use pixel tags in order to measure and understand traffic better, improve site performance, track visitor behaviour to improve user experience, and for tracking promotional and marketing campaign response, among others. You can disable the pixel tag feature by changing the settings on your e-mail client to prevent the automatic downloading of images, changing your browser settings to omit images, disabling Javascript, or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Do You Use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</strong><br>
		Our websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Do You Serve Targeted Advertising?</strong><br>
		We also work with third parties that use tracking technologies on our websites in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These third party partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive. Advertisers and third party advertising partners may use third party cookies in order to collect information about you, which may include how many times you have seen their ads or whether you have interacted with an ad. They may also use third party cookies to provide you with interest-based or behavioural advertising. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide this information.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>How Can I Control Cookies?</strong><br>
		You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or reject cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our websites, however your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be severely restricted.</span></span></p>

Opting out relies on information in the unique cookies placed on your web browser by our partners, so if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again.&nbsp; Please note that if you use your browser settings to block all cookies you may not be able to access parts of our or others' websites. The “Help” feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its developer. Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to utilize certain critical features on our websites, such as adding items to your shopping cart, proceeding to checkout, or using essential features or services that require you to sign in.</span></span></li>

If you choose to turn off these cookies, you will still be served with advertisements on the Internet, but it may not be tailored to your interests. Whilst many companies involved in using advertising cookies and serving online behavioural advertising appear at the links above, not all do, so please remember that even if you choose to turn off cookies used by all of the companies listed, you may still receive some advertising cookies and some tailored advertisements from other companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li>

We do this by using information that you provide to us or we obtain through tracking technologies. To prevent this, some web browsers offer a “Do Not Track” signal that is a HTTP header field indicating your preference regarding tracking or cross-site user tracking. Like many other websites and online services, we do not currently alter our practices when we receive Do Not Track signals as there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you may wish to visit&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutdnt.com/</a>.</span></li>
