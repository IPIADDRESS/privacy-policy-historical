Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to   monitor website or game usage.

Most browsers are automatically set to accept  cookies  whenever you visit a website. You can disable cookies or set  your  browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. To disable your   cookies, please visit <strong><a title="www.crytek.com/support" href="http://www.crytek.com/support" target="_blank">www.crytek.com/support</a></strong>.</p>
<p>We may also use flash cookies, also known as "local shared objects,"   on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small  files  similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site's  settings  to personalize the look and feel of the site. Flash cookies  only  collect data in the aggregate. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies  are  represented as small files on your computer.

                            <p><strong>2.&nbsp; Third Party Ad Serving Technology</strong></p>
<p>The companies that serve the ads that may appear on our websites may   also collect information regarding your activities online, including  the  sites you visit. For more information on such services or to opt  out of  those services, please visit such services’ websites.</p>

<h2>IV.&nbsp; What Happens To The Information Crytek Collects?</h2>
<h3>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; How Crytek Uses Your Information</h3>
<p>Crytek uses your information to operate Crytek’s games, fulfill your   specific requests, purchase orders and to send you purchase  confirmation  and other account-related information. In addition, if you  choose to  receive communications from us about Crytek products and  news, the  personal information you provide will allow us to send you  messages  about things including new products, features, enhancements,  special  offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest.  You may  also later opt out of this service from Crytek.</p>
<p>Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is also   conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public   display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and   achievements) generated through your participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>B.&nbsp; Will Crytek Share My Information With Third Parties?</h3>
<p>Crytek will never share your personal information with third parties   without your consent. We may, however, share non-personal data in the   aggregate (in a form that does not personally identify you) with third   parties. You may also opt in to allow Crytek to share your personal   information with companies and organizations that provide products or   services that we believe may be of interest to you. To opt out of   further communications from a marketing partner or sponsor with whom   your information has been shared, please contact that partner or sponsor   directly.</p>
<p>From time to time, Crytek employs third party contractors to collect   personal information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product,   or promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card   processing, shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting   these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address,   telephone number and email address to our contractors. We ask some third   party contractors, such as credit agencies or market research firms,  to  supplement personal information that you provide to us for our own   marketing and demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve   our sites and related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and   preferences.</p>
<p>When our third party contractors collect and/or have access to the   personal information you provide to Crytek, Crytek requires that they   adhere to our stated privacy policies and protect the confidentiality of   personal information they collect or have access to in the course of   their engagement by Crytek. These third parties are prohibited from   using your personal information for any other purpose without your   specific consent.</p>
<p>You will be notified before your personal information is collected by   any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can  make  an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information  with  that party.</p>
<p>We may also disclose personal information to law enforcement, or the   appropriate civil authorities to enforce legal rights and comply with   the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other   competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure   is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference  with  our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be  harmed or  may suffer loss or damage, or when we believe that disclosure  is  necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a   judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Crytek.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
