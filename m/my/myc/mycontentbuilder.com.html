            <p><b>Information We Gather or Track</b></p>
            <p>The following are details of the information we collect:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>My Content Builder collects data so that we may display personalized
                content to our visitors. Additionally, usage information may be
                analyzed so that we can judge our system's performance or execute
                your customized features. </li>
              <li>Your computer reaches us via an particular IP (<b>I</b>nternet
                <b>P</b>rotocol) address. This can tell us things like what part
                of the world you're coming from or what service provider you are
                using, but About.com does not link your IP address to any personally
                identifiable information about you. </li>

  <li>Your browser offers so-called "cookies" which -- if you allow their
    use -- store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any
    of our sites. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like
    best. And when you re-visit our GuideSites<sup><small>TM</small></sup>, cookies
    can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. However,
    cookies tell us nothing about you personally unless you specifically give
    us additional information. The About.com Web site is viewable even if a user
    disables the cookie function within the Web browser, however, some advanced
    features use cookies to assist in keeping track of your location within the
    About.com Web site in order to provide navigational trails and similar navigational
    features. These cookies are not used to personally identify your surfing patterns,
    and are merely used to provide navigation links. Disabling your cookies simply
    means that some of these features will not have custom navigation available
    to you. </li>
              <li>Our registration form asks for contact and demographic information
                used to send news about our products or promotional material from
                our partners. You will be able to opt-out of receiving any mailings.
              </li>
              <li>Surveys may ask for contact information or unique identifying
                information to increase the value of the results. Contests may
                require contact information or other demographic/personal information
                in order to determine your eligibility. </li>

            <p><b>What We Do with Collected Information</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>We sometimes use provided information to personalize features
                of our site based upon your preferences.
              </li>

  <li>From time to time, we extend various offers through our partner companies.
    These may include news or additional details on their products and services.
    Your personal preferences or usage history may result in your being offered
    special screens or products. These offers would be sent via Cutts Group and
    your personal information is not shared with entities outside of Cutts Group
    llc. </li>

  <li>We produce aggregate reports for advertisers. For example, we tell advertisers
    how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally, how many people
    saw or clicked on ads in different portions of our service. Where available,
    we may offer additional information about viewer characteristics. <em>However,
    this does <b>not</b> include personally identifiable information about you
    or your online usage patterns</em>. Our advertisers allow us to provide our
    service to you. In return, they need to know how to effectively place their
    ads to potential customers.</li>

  <li>We'll use your email contact information to provide you with newsletters
    to which you subscribe, or for similar information we think you may find of
    interest. However, you can choose to opt out of these mailings. By providing
    your contact information, you will be eligible to acquire user ID's and passwords
    that will allow you to participate in our discussion features, including chat
    and bulletin boards. </li>

            <ul>
              <li>As mentioned in our "What We Do With Collected Information"
                section, we provide our advertisers with aggregate reports on
                advertising activity. </li>
              <li>Please be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information
                online, personal or otherwise, that information can be collected
                and used by others. For example, using chat, bulletin boards,
                or your e-mail, if you post personal information online you may
                receive unsolicited messages from others. My Content Builder will
                have no means to control this. </li>

              for specific contests or to enable your participation within our
              discussion areas, some degree of personal and contact information
              will be necessary. You can always choose not to receive additional
