    <div align="center"><h1 class="header">Online  Privacy Policy (Last Updated 10/27/2009)</h1></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your privacy is  important to us at MyContent.com, LLC(“MyContent”). Our online privacy policy  (“Privacy Policy”) describes the types of information we gather from those  persons visiting the Internet website www.mycontent.com  (the “Site”) and how we use that information.&nbsp; </p><h3 class="subheader"><p>By accessing this Site, you agree to be bound by the Privacy  Policy.&nbsp; If you do not agree to the terms  of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Site.&nbsp; Each time you use the Site, the current  version of the Privacy Policy will apply.&nbsp;  Accordingly, when you use the Site, you should check the date of this  Policy (which appears at the top) and review any changes since the last  version.</p></h3><p></p>
    
    <h3 class="subheader">1.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General</h3>
     <p> We  may collect two types of information from users of our Site: "personally  identifiable information" (such as first name, last name, e-mail address,  phone number, etc.) and "aggregate information" (such as frequency of  visits to the Site, Site pages most frequently accessed, browser type, etc.).&nbsp; We use this information in an effort to  improve your experience on the Site, to communicate with you about the Site or  special offers, and to help us develop and improve our Site.&nbsp; </p>
    <p></p><h3 class="subheader">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection of Personally Identifiable  Information </h3> <p></p>
    <p>We only collect  personally identifiable information that is voluntarily provided by  visitors&nbsp; of the Site when visitors  become a registered member of the Site.&nbsp;  For example, registered members must provide their first name, last  name, and email address as part of the registration process. </p>
    <p>In order to view  and purchase content on the Site that is <u>not</u> designated as free by a  content owner, you must be a registered member.&nbsp;  In addition, to view content that is <u>not</u> designated as free, you  will need to provide your credit card information to make the proper payment. </p><h3 class="subheader"></h3><p></p>
    <p>If you want to view  content that has been offered for free by content owners on the Site, you are not required to become a registered member or  provide any personally identifiable information.&nbsp; </p>
    <p></p><h3 class="subheader">3.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection of Aggregate  information</h3>
      <p>We also collect  aggregate information, which is non-personally identifiable/anonymous  information, such as frequency of visits to the Site, Site pages most  frequently accessed, browser type, etc.&nbsp;  Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, and no single  person can be identified by that compiled information. </p>
    <p></p><h3 class="subheader">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection  and Use of IP Addresses</h3>
    <p>We may collect IP  addresses to obtain aggregate information on the Site.&nbsp; An IP address is a number assigned to your  computer by a web server when you are on the web.&nbsp; When you are on our Site, we have a back-end  server that logs your computer's IP address.&nbsp;  We only use the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in  the aggregate, such as how many users entered a specific area of our Site, and  not to track a specific IP address to identify an individual user. However, we  may use such information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may be  safety and/or security issues or to comply with legal requirements. </p>
    <p></p><h3 class="subheader">5.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing,  Selling, and Trading Personally Identifiable Information Collected Online with  Third Parties</h3><p></p>
    <p>We do not share,  sell or trade with third parties your personally identifiable information  gathered online, except as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p>We will not sell, share,  trade or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information with third  parties for their own marketing purposes.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>We may share  personally identifiable information with third party service providers, such as  companies who send e-mails on behalf of MyContent, credit card processing  companies, etc. These third parties are not authorized to retain, share, store  or use your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than  completion of the services for which they were hired.</p>
    <p>We do not share  personally identifiable information collected on the Site with content  owners.&nbsp; If you become a fan of a  particular content owner, then the content owner will have access to your user  name only (and any additional information you voluntarily decide to provide to  the content owner).</p>

    <p>Finally, in the following circumstances we may share or transfer  personally identifiable information to unrelated third parties: (i) to comply  with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or  legal process served on us; (ii) to  investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) in  connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or  dissolution of either of our companies; or (iv) when we believe it is  appropriate to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of our  companies or other persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p></p><h3 class="subheader">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing,  Selling and Trading Aggregate Information Collected Online With Third Parties</h3>
      <p>We may sell, share or trade compiled aggregate information with third  parties. As stated earlier, no single person can be identified by such  aggregate information. </p>
    <p></p><h3 class="subheader">&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Message Boards/Profile Pages</h3>
    <p>On the Site, we provide message boards and profile pages for registered  members to post comments and messages for others to read.&nbsp; We may collect technical information about  your post, such as the IP address from which you posted, and associate this  information with your messages.&nbsp; Even if  messages are deleted, we may retain copies and attendant information indefinitely. </p>
    <p>When you post messages to the message boards or profile pages, certain  registration information, such as your user name, may be available to the  public. Also note that any personally identifiable information you include in  the body of your message or on profile pages will be available to the public so  it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when  deciding to reveal personally identifiable information in these areas. </p>
    <p>
    </p><h3 class="subheader">8.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use  of Cookies&nbsp; </h3>
