    <h1>General Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Privacy is fundamental to BEEMOOV. This “General Privacy Policy” applies to all
    visitors and users of <a href="http://www.mycandylove.com">www.mycandylove.com</a>. 
    You must agree to the <a href="/cgu.html">Terms of Service</a> before enjoying the benefits of a registered user.</p>
<p>
    Each MEMBER can share personal information on forums accessible by other
    MEMBERS. Here’s how it works:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Any MEMBER can view Forum discussions, comments or any other private
        information that a MEMBER may post to the PLATFORM.
    </li>
    <li>
        We don’t share your private information with anyone (except for operating the
        Website).
    </li>
    <li>
        If you post any content on the Website, you are making it available publicly.
        Your submission of any content is subject to the right of BEEMOOV to remove
        inappropriate postings.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    BEEMOOV has instituted measures to protect the security and content of the forums.
</p>
<p>
    BEEMOOV regularly monitors its forums through a team of volunteers, a country
    manager and potentially others acting on behalf of BEEMOOV. BEEMOOV does
    not control the content of any messages before publication. Any delays in such post-publication
    review may result in potentially substantial distribution to an online audience
    before actual review.
</p>

<p><strong>
        You should avoid disclosing any personal information that you do not wish to make
        public to other MEMBERS.
    </strong>
</p>

<h3>
    Collection of Information
</h3>
<p>
    When you visit our Website we may collect information regarding your visit from your
    computer. Such information helps us to determine information about how you found our
    Website, the date that you visited our Website and search engines that may have led you
    to our Website. We collect this information in order to continually improve and enhance
    the functionality of <a href="http://www.mycandylove.com">www.mycandylove.com</a>
</p>

<p>
    Generally, you may provide us with two types of information, User Content, which
    may include Personal Information, and Website Usage Information, both of which are
    discussed in greater detail below.
</p>

<h4>
    Retention of Information
</h4>

<p>
    Your Personal Information may be retained for the period of your ongoing use plus up
    to three years after you expressly terminate your membership or your account is dormant
    for a period of four months. The tracking cookies may be retained for the period of your
    ongoing use after such termination or dormancy. Such retention periods may be extended
    if mandated by law or otherwise required for the protection of our rights.
</p>

<h4>

</h4>

    <strong>
        This website is not directed to children under the age of 13 years. If you are under

        are under 13, you should be smart and not provide any information on

        do so under your parent’s consent and supervision.
    </strong>
</p>

<h3>
    Personal Information You Choose to Provide
</h3>

<p>
    In order to make your visits to our Website as enjoyable as possible, we may ask you for
    Personal Information. Personal Information includes, for example, your email
    address, which you are asked to provide when registering with BEEMOOV.
    Below is a description of some of the ways that you may provide Personal Information to
    us, as well as further details on how we may use such Personal Information.
</p>
<div class="indent">
    <h4>
        1. Sign-Up Information and Profile
    </h4>
    <p>
        You provide us with Personal Information, such as your email address,
        when you register a Member account with the Website. You may also choose to
        add information to your profile.
    </p>
    <h4>
        2. Contact Us/Feedback
    </h4>
    <p>
        If you email us at <a href="mailto:support@beemoov.com">support@beemoov.com</a>, we may ask you for information such as your name and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. If you choose to correspond with us via email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our response to you. In certain cases, and with your permission, we may post content from your emails to us on the BEEMOOV Website.
    </p>
    <h4>
        3. Questionnaires and Surveys
    </h4>
    <p>
        We may occasionally ask users of our Website to complete online surveys and
        opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us
        better serve you and improve the usefulness of BEEMOOV. In requesting your
        participation in these surveys we may ask you to provide your name and email
        address to us.
    </p>
    <h4>
        4. User Content
    </h4>
    <p>
        Our Website offers its users the opportunity to share User Content – for instance, on your user profile, status, the forum and through private messages. If you choose to use these features, you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit through
        these features can be read, collected, or used by other viewers of these forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums.
    </p>
    <h4>
        5. Import Contacts
    </h4>
    <p>
        We may utilize an “import contacts” feature to help you keep in touch with your
        contacts and other members. This may make it easier for you to invite people from your
        email address book to join you on our Website. If implemented, you can manually import a file from your email program or you can provide us with your email username and
        password and the BEEMOOV program will import your email contacts for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you import your contacts, we may ask you if you wish to invite or follow
        your colleagues from your same domain. If you indicate that you would like to
        follow them, we will send them an invitation from you (with a return address
        of <a href="mailto:support@beemoov.com">support@beemoov.com</a>) to activate a BEEMOOV account and join the same
        domain network as you. We may also send one reminder message after the
        original invitation if we do not hear back from them. People you invite to join the
        Website may opt out of receiving further emails from BEEMOOV as described in
        the Rights to Opt In/Opt Out section below.
    </p>

<h3>
    Website Usage Information
</h3>
<div class="indent">
    <h4>
        1. Cookies
    </h4>
    <p>
        We may use “cookies” on or in connection with our Website to maintain
        information about you. A cookie is a very small text document, which often
        includes an anonymous unique identifier. BEEMOOV employs the use of both
        “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your
        hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your
        browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed
        by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and
        disappears after you close your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you visit our Website, our computer may ask your computer for permission
        to employ the use of a session or persistent cookie. Our Website will then send
        a cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect
        your privacy) your browser only permits our Website to access the cookies it has
        already sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most web browsers can be adjusted to inform you when a cookie has been sent to
        you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. However, refusing
        a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the
        display or function of, our Website or certain areas or features of our Website.
    </p>
    <p>
        We work with business partners who provide advertising, technology services
        and other that goods and services to make your visit more interesting. We permit
        such business partners to add cookies to your computer and track your use of their
        information or services. We require such business partners to respect our privacy
        policy.
    </p>
    <h4>
        2. IP Address and Clickstream Data
    </h4>
    <p>
        Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when
        you visit us. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the website you visit after this Website; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral website; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may also link this information with Personal Information. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Any or all of these activities with regard to the above-described Website Usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our third-party service providers. (See “Sharing Information with Third Parties” section below).
    </p>
</div>
<h3>
    Rights to Opt In/Opt Out
</h3>
<p>
    Information. For example, if you are prompted to provide Personal Information on this
    Website or in connection with our communications to you, you may have the opportunity
    to elect whether you would like to receive such correspondence from us. You may opt
    out of BEEMOOV’s promotional e-mails by clicking on the opt-out or “unsubscribe”
    link within the email you receive. You can also make this request by sending an email to
    <a href="mailto:support@beemoov.com">support@beemoov.com</a>, specifying whether: (i) you would like to opt out of receiving
    promotional correspondence from BEEMOOV in general, or just via e-mail, postal
    mail and/or by phone, and/or whether (ii) you would only like to opt out of certain of
    BEEMOOV’s e-newsletters or correspondence.
</p>
<p>
    Please understand that if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us,
    we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and
    communications with us.
</p>

<h3>
    Use and Disclosure of Personal Information
</h3>
<p>
    We will use your Personal Information to respond to your requests and to provide you
    with our product and service offerings. We may match information collected from you
    through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and
    Website Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained
    from other sources, including (without limitation) any of our other websites and third
    parties. If you choose to import your address book contacts as part of BEEMOOV’s
    invitation process, we may store those names and emails and display them to other
    MEMBERS in a forum on the Website in order to customize the Service for you and to enable you and coworkers in your Network to generate subsequent invitations. We may send you notices (for example, in the form of emails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies, events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt out of receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the Rights to Opt In/Opt Out section above.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, we may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our
    Website and emails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. BEEMOOV will
    not share, rent or sell your Personal Information to other parties, except as provided in
    this Privacy Policy.

<h3>
    Sharing Information with Third Parties
</h3>
<div class="indent">
    <h4>
        1. Service Providers
    </h4>
    <p>
        We may use third-party partners to help us operate and maintain our Website and
        deliver our products and services. We may also share your Personal Information
        and Website Usage Information with our service providers and other third parties
        (“Affiliated Parties”) that provide products or services for or through this Website
        or for our business (such as website or database hosting companies, address list
        hosting companies, communications providers, email service providers, analytics
        companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, credit card processing
        companies and other similar service providers that use such information on our
        behalf).
    </p>
    <p>
        Third-party service providers are contractually restricted from using or disclosing
        the Personal Information and Website Usage Information except as necessary to
        perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements, or otherwise
        subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h4>
        2. Aggregate Statistics
    </h4>
    <p>
        We may disclose non-personally identifiable aggregate statistics regarding user
        behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and emails to third
        parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic
        reports, which do not describe or identify any individual user. Information
        relating to aggregate statistics may be collected through the use of third-party
        cookies and other third party tracking devices.
    </p>
    <h4>
        3. Legally Compelled Disclosures
    </h4>
    <p>

    By providing Personal Information to us through this Website, you agree that it may be used by us and our Affiliated Parties for the purposes described herein and you further understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories, which may have different privacy laws from your country of residence and which may afford varying levels of protection for your Personal Information. Regardless of the laws in place in these countries, we will treat the privacy of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By providing your Personal Information to this Website, you consent to our transmission to, and processing of your information in, any jurisdiction, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

<h3>

    You retain the right to decline to submit Personal Information through BEEMOOV, in which case BEEMOOV may not be able to provide certain services to you. However, if you choose to provide Personal Information to BEEMOOV, we will provide you with the ability to access, correct, update or delete the Personal Information you have provided to this Website by emailing <a href="mailto:support@beemoov.com">support@beemoov.com</a> We will respond to your request within 30 days.

<h3>
    Third-Party Websites
</h3>
<p>
    When you are on this Website you may have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other websites, including other websites operated by BEEMOOV or by unaffiliated third parties. These websites may collect Personal Information about you, and because this Privacy Policy does not address the information practices of those other websites, you should review the privacy policies of such other websites to see how they treat your Personal Information.
</p>
<h3>
    Security
</h3>
<p>
    BEEMOOV and our partners uses commercially reasonable and industry standard physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information. We also use Secure Sockets Layer (BEEMOOV’s business partners, who permit purchases undertaken by players, use SSL technology) encryption to transmit sensitive information. While BEEMOOV endeavors to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to this Website, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.
</p>
<p>
    If you contact us by email or a “contact us” or similar feature on the Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. An unaffiliated third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
</p>
<p>
    In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email. You consent to our use of email as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@beemoov.com">support@beemoov.com</a> with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.
