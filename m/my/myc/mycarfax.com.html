	      CARFAX will collect your name, mailing address, email address, 
	      and payment card information when you purchase CARFAX® Vehicle 
	      History Reports™ ("CARFAX Reports").  For services offered at no cost 
	      to you, such as myCARFAX and Hot Listings, CARFAX may require you to 
	      provide an email address.  CARFAX may also require a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) 
	      or license plate information to provide the relevant vehicle history information.  
      </p>

      <p>
	      CARFAX also allows you to (1) enter information regarding your vehicle when you use myCARFAX, 
	      and (2) share feedback related to third party products or services and submit other content 
	      or materials through public postings on CARFAX web sites.  Please be aware that if you disclose 
	      personally identifiable information or other sensitive information through public postings on 
	      CARFAX web sites the information will be viewable by others.
      </p>

      <p>
	      CARFAX web sites may contain <b>web beacons</b> to collect data regarding user traffic patterns. 
	      CARFAX web sites use <b>cookies</b> to collect information about your computer hardware (desktop, 
	      laptop, mobile devices etc.) and software, including without limitation, referring domains, 
	      the type of browser used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, 
	      IP addresses and plug-ins. We may collect, or have a third party collect on our behalf, data 
	      on the number of visits, paths taken, time spent on CARFAX web sites, how visitors use and navigate 
	      through the CARFAX web site (examples include, the number of users who visit various pages within 
	      the CARFAX web sites, information accessed by such visitors, whether they scroll up or down on 
	      particular pages or complete any forms), and other anonymous information that you may submit in the 
	      course of searching for vehicles such as zip code and/or type of vehicle viewed.  We use this 
	      information to improve the CARFAX web sites and learn about users, and may disclose it to our affiliates 
	      or to third parties. We may include web beacons in some of our email communications to gauge the effectiveness 
	      of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.
      </p>

      <p>
	      If you choose to participate in CARFAX surveys while on CARFAX web sites you may be asked 
	      to provide other anonymous demographic information such as zip code, age, gender, preferences 
	      and interests.
      </p>
      
      <p><b><a name="use">Use of the information</a></b><a href="#top"><font size="1">(back to top)</font></a><br>
        CARFAX uses the information you provide to deliver services requested by you.  You may also receive emails 
        from CARFAX offering additional CARFAX products and services and other special offers and promotions related 
        to the used car buying and ownership process.  Information related to your vehicle that you submit through 
        myCARFAX may be included in the vehicle history information for that vehicle.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We use information collected through cookies and web beacons to analyze usage and deliver customized content 
        and advertising and uncover ways in which we can improve CARFAX web sites and make them easier to use.  
        Information provided by visitors to the CARFAX web sites who choose to complete user surveys helps us better 
        understand how visitors to the CARFAX web sites are using CARFAX information and develop better products and 
        services for you. CARFAX occasionally appends data collected through CARFAX web sites with third party data to 
        effectively plan customer communications and marketing campaigns and analyze how the CARFAX web sites are used.
      </p>


      <p><b><a name="protect">Protection of the information </a></b><a href="#top"><font size="1">(back to top)</font></a><br>
	      We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards against unauthorized access to the information 
	      CARFAX collects.  For example, when you complete the CARFAX Report order form, all information you enter is 
	      encrypted via a secure sockets layer (SSL) before it is sent over the Internet to our secure servers and/or 
	      credit card processor, as applicable.  We do not retain the full payment card account number submitted in 
	      the process of purchasing a CARFAX Report in our systems, but we may store partial payment card number for up 
	      to six months for our reference.  To protect against unauthorized access to your account, we recommend that 
	      you protect your password, log out of your account and close your browser after each use.
