  <h2>Keep yourself safe online</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Never reveal your password to anyone or write it down</li>
  <li>Don’t use a password that could be easily guessed  by someone else</li>
  <li>Change your password immediately if you suspect  someone else could know it</li>
  <li>Log off when you’ve completed your transaction</li>
  <li>Keep your PC updated with current anti-virus  software and the latest browser versions</li>
  <li>Don’t send us any confidential account information  by email</li>
  <li>Treat emails you receive with caution. Remember that  we’ll never ask you to disclose your personal or account information to us by  email</li>
  <li>We recommend that you regularly visit the <a href="http://www.banksafeonline.org.uk/" title="http://www.banksafeonline.org.uk" target="cashplus">http://www.banksafeonline.org.uk</a> website  to keep up-to-date with tips to protect yourself from the latest scams</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Username and  Password</h3>
<p>On registering a Cashplus account with us, you’ll have a username and  password which must be used in order to access certain restricted parts of the  website. Your username and password are used by us to identify you, so they’re  very important. You’re responsible for all information posted on the website by  anyone using your username and password. Any breach of security of a username  and password should be notified to us immediately.</p>
<p>We recommend you also read our <a href="/customer-help/card-security.aspx" title="Keeping your card safe">guidelines  on keeping your Cashplus prepaid Gold MasterCard<span class="reg">®</span> safe</a></p>

<a name="our_system_security" title="Our system security"></a>
<h2>Our system security</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Our systems operate on 128-bit secure encryption.  Look for the yellow padlock symbol in your browser status bar</li>
  <li>A team of independent security experts regularly  tests our website
  </li><li>Your session will time out if you don’t use your  keyboard for more than 15 minutes</li>
  <li>Your Cashplus Account Members’ log-in will be  locked out after three failed access attempts. You’ll need to <a href="/contact-us/default.aspx" title="Contact Us">contact us</a> to reset your account</li>
  <li>We’ll verify your identity before disclosing  confidential information over the phone or resetting your password</li>
  <li>We don’t guarantee the website will be fault free and  don’t accept liability for any errors or omissions </li>
</ul>
  
<p>
All forms and online account pages, i.e. those pages that show your  information, use 128-bit encryption. Encryption makes your information  unreadable to anyone who might intercept it. In addition, a Secure Sockets  Layer (SSL) is used to connect your browser to our secure servers.
</p>
<p>
The latest browsers support 128-bit encryption. Older browsers (such as  Internet explorer 5.0) support lower levels of encryption (40-bit or 56-bit)  but they still remain extremely secure. 
</p>

<h3>Secure Socket Layer  (SSL)</h3>
<p>
A "Secure Socket Layer" is a commonly used method of managing  the security of messages transmitted across the Internet and is used by us to  connect your computer to our secure server. You can tell that SSL is in use if  you are using Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator when a small padlock icon  appears on your browser status bar. If you have problems getting to secure  mode, install one of the latest browsers and try the website again.
</p>
<h3>Which browser do I  need to view this website?</h3>
<p>
Our website has been designed to work with a variety of the latest browsers  on either Apple Macintosh computers or Windows based PCs. 
</p>
<p>
If you’re using an older browser such as Internet Explorer 3, Opera 3  and 4, you’ll be able to view the information pages, but you may not be able to  apply for a card or access your account information. To make an application  online we recommend that you upgrade to the latest versions.
</p>
<h3>Need to change  your screen resolution?</h3>
<p>
We recommend viewing this website with a screen resolution of 1024x768 or  above. 
</p>
<h3>Do you need  plug-ins?</h3>
<p>
"Plug-ins" are additional software programs required by some  websites to make them work properly. An example is Flash Player from Adobe. Our  website doesn’t need any plug-ins to work effectively.
</p>
<h3>Having difficulty  accessing your account from work?</h3>
<p>
Most organisations have what is known as a "firewall" to  protect their networks and their computers. A firewall is a secure server  through which all communication passes and which protects the organisation's  computers from unauthorised access by filtering the information getting in and  out. Depending on how the firewall is set up, access to another secure server  may be denied.
</p>
<p>
If you’re having problems accessing your account from work but can  access it from home with no difficulties, check with your IT department to see  if a firewall is in place that may be affecting access to our website and how this  has been set up.
</p>

<a name="use_of_email" title="Use of email"></a>
<h2>Use of email</h2>
<p>
Please note that ordinary email is not secure.
</p>
<p>
Please don’t send us any confidential information via email. We’ll only  use email to send you account information, such as your account balance and  transaction information or special offers, if you’ve given your consent. We  won’t use e-mail to send other confidential personal information to you. We  can’t accept any responsibility for the unauthorised access by a third party  and/or the corruption of data being sent by individuals to APS. It’s our policy  that if any of our customers are victims of unauthorised access to their  accounts, and provided that you have not breached our security procedures,  acted fraudulently or without reasonable care, we’ll cover any direct financial  loss which you may have suffered.
</p>
<p>
We’ll never send emails to you requesting security or any other  confidential information. Don’t reply to any such emails or disclose any  personal information. If you think you’ve received a fraudulent email that’s  designed to look as if it was sent from us, forward the entire email including  the header and footer to <a href="mailto:fraud@apsgroup.com" title="fraud@apsgroup.com" class="mail">fraud@apsgroup.com</a> then delete it from your email account.
</p>

<a name="use_of_cookies" title="Use of cookies"></a>
<h2>Use of cookies</h2>

<h3>What we use  cookies for:</h3>
<p>
Internet cookies are common and don’t harm your system. They are small  text files placed on your computer by a web browser, which has been sent to you  by a web server. They just store or gather website information. It’s essentially  an 'identification card' relating to you. They help you do things online, like  remembering your logon details so you don't have to re-enter them when  revisiting a website.
</p>

<h3>We use cookies to:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gather customer journey information across our website
  </li><li>Ensure your privacy in our secure websites</li>
  <li>Store login details for our secure websites</li>
  <li>Temporarily store details input into our  calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstrations</li>
  <li>Store details of your marketing, product and  business unit preferences to improve our targeting and enhance your journey  through our websites</li>
  <li>Evaluate our website’s advertising and promotional  effectiveness</li>
</ul>

<p>

We don't use cookies to track people's Internet usage after leaving  our websites and we don't store personal information in them that others could  read and understand. We won’t sell or distribute cookie information without  your prior consent.
</p>
<p>
You can disable cookies from your computer system by following the instructions at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" title="All about cookies website" target="cashplus">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> but if you don’t accept incoming cookies, the performance of our website on your  system may not be to the full standard, or our website may not serve you at all.
</p>

<h3>Services that need  enabled cookies:</h3>
<p>
Some of our services require cookies in your browser to view and use  them and to protect your financial and personal information such as www.Cashplus.co.uk.  This website uses cookies to enable information about you and your preferences  to be stored and to prevent unauthorised access to your account online. If you’re  accessing your Cashplus account, we need cookies to be used to ensure that your  data is secure. If you reject cookies, you won’t be able to use the Cashplus  service.
</p>

<a name="phishing"></a>
<h2>Phishing</h2>
<p>
Some customers may receive an email claiming to be from APS, AFL with a  link to what appears to be our, AFL's website, where they are prompted to enter  their personal and account details. APS is in no way involved with this email  and the website does not belong to us, AFL. APS will never send emails to its  customers requesting security or any other confidential information. Don’t  reply to any such emails or disclose any personal information in these  websites. If you think you’ve received a fraudulent email that looks like it is  from APS or AFL, forward the entire email including the header and footer to  fraud@apsgroup.com and then delete it from your email account.
</p>

<a name="personal_information"></a>
<h2>Personal  Information</h2>

<h3>Data Protection:</h3>
<p>
When you apply for a product or service from us (or another party), you’ll  be asked for personal information that’s needed to process your application.  The information that you provide will only be used for the purposes described  at the time of your application and where applicable in the terms and  conditions that apply to the relevant product or service. 
</p>
<p>
We’ll also collect, store and process your personal information on the  APS computers to; (a) personalise aspects of our overall service to you; or (b)  communicate with you; or (c) learn from the way you use and manage your  account(s), for example from the transactions you make and from the payments  which are made to your account; or (d) We may retain information about you and your account for up to 6 years after your account is closed. We will use your personal information to manage  your account(s), and provide our services, for assessment and analysis  (including credit and/or behaviour scoring, market and product analysis), and  to develop and improve our services to you. If you don’t want to receive  information about our products and services, please write to Customer Services  at PO Box 466, Salford, M50 2XU  or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@apsgroup.com" title="info@apsgroup.com" class="mail">info@apsgroup.com</a>.

<ul>
  <li>To fraud prevention agencies and other  organisations who may use the information to prevent fraud and money laundering</li>
  <li>To persons acting as our agents under a strict code  of confidentiality</li>
  <li>To anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our  rights and duties under our terms and conditions with you</li>
  <li>As required by law or regulation</li>
</ul>
<p>
If we transfer your information to a service  provider or agent in another country outside the European Union, we’ll make  sure that the service provider or agent agrees to apply the same levels of  protection as we’re required to apply to personal information held in the UK,  and to use your information only for the purpose of providing the service to us.
