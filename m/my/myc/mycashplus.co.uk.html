								<h4>Security and privacy</h4>
<p>You may have concerns about the security of your money on the internet or how your personal information is protected from misuse. This section explains our web security promise, the measures we take to protect you and what you can do to protect yourself from online fraud.</p>
<p><strong>What we do:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Our systems operate on 128-bit secure encryption. Look for the yellow padlock symbol in your browser status bar.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>A team of independent security experts regularly tests our website.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Your session will time out after 15 minutes of keyboard inactivity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Your log-in account will be locked out after three failed access attempts. You will need to call us to reset your account.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>We will verify your identity before disclosing confidential information over the telephone or re-setting your password.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We do not guarantee the Site will be fault free and do not accept liability for any errors or omissions that occur.</p>
<p><strong>Your Username and Password</strong></p>
<p>On registering an account with us, you will have a username and password which must be used in order to access certain restricted parts of the Site. Your username and password are used by us to identify you and so are very important. You are responsible for all information posted on the Site by anyone using your username and password. Any breach of security of a username and password should be notified to us immediately.</p>
<p><strong>What you should do</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Never reveal your password to anyone or write it down.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Do not use a password that could be easily guessed by someone else.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Change your password immediately if you suspect someone else could know it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Log off when you have completed your transaction.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Keep your PC updated with current anti-virus software and the latest browser versions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Do not send us any confidential account information via email.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Treat emails you receive with caution. Remember we will never ask you to disclose your personal or account information to us by email.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend that you regularly visit the <a title="Bank Safe Online Link" href="http://www.banksafeonline.org.uk/">www.banksafeonline.org.uk</a> website to keep up to date with tips to protect yourself from the latest scams. </p>
<p><strong>Security Notice</strong> </p>
<p>All forms and online account pages, i.e. those pages that show your information, use 128-bit encryption. Encryption makes your information unreadable to anyone who might intercept it. In addition, a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is used to connect your browser to our secure servers. </p>
<p>The latest browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer 6, Netscape 6, Opera 5) support 128-bit encryption. Browsers older than this support lower levels of encryption (40-bit or 56-bit) but they still remain extremely secure. You should note that ordinary e-mail is not secure. </p>
<p>Please do not send us any confidential information via email. We will only use e-mail to send you account information such as your account balance and transaction information or&nbsp;special&nbsp;offers if you have given&nbsp;your consent for us to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not use e-mail to send other confidential personal information to you. We cannot accept any responsibility for the unauthorised access by a third party and/or the corruption of data being sent by individuals to APS. It is our policy that if any of our customers are victims of unauthorised access to their accounts, and provided that you have not breached our security procedures, acted fraudulently or without reasonable care, we will cover any direct financial loss which you may have suffered. </p>
<p><strong>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</strong> </p>
<p>A "Secure Socket Layer" is a commonly used method of managing the security of messages transmitted across the Internet and is used by us to connect your computer to our secure server. You can tell that SSL is in use if you are using Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator when a small padlock icon appears on your browser status bar. If you have problems getting to secure mode, install one of the latest browsers and try the site again.</p>
<p><strong>Which browser do I need to view this site?</strong> </p>
<p>Our site has been designed to work with a variety of browsers on either Apple Macintosh computers or Windows based PCs. It will run on versions 4 and later of Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator and America On-Line (AOL), as well as Opera 5. </p>
<p>If you are using an older browser such as Internet Explorer 3, Netscape 3 or Opera 3 &amp; 4, you will be able to view the information pages but you may not be able to apply for a card or access your account information. To make an application online we recommend you upgrade to the latest versions. </p>
<p><strong>How do I change my screen resolution?</strong> </p>
<p>We recommend viewing this site with a screen resolution of 800x600 or above. To change the screen resolution depends on the operating system you use. Please consult your operating system manual for instructions. </p>
<p><strong>Do I need plug-ins?</strong> </p>
<p>"Plug-ins" are additional software programs required by some sites to make them work properly. An example is Flash Player from Macromedia. Our site does not need any plug-ins to work effectively. </p>
<p><strong>I am having difficulty accessing my account from work</strong> </p>
<p>Most organisations have what is known as "firewalls" to protect their networks and their computers. A firewall is a secure server through which all communication passes and which protects the organisation's computers from unauthorised access by filtering the information getting in and out. Depending on how the firewall is set up, access to another secure server may be denied. </p>
<p>If you are having problems accessing your account from work but can access it from home with no difficulties, check with your IT department to see if a firewall is in place that may be affecting access to our site and how this has been set up. </p>
