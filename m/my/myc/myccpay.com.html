               <p>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protecting the privacy and security of your personal information is a top priority for
               Total Card, Inc. This Privacy Policy Notice will help you understand how we safeguard
               and use information, and applies to all applicants, customers or former customers who
               obtain financial services from us for personal, family or household purposes. It also
               identifies the sources from which we collect non-public personal information about you,
               details the measures we take to secure that information, and describes the information

               This Privacy Policy Notice explains how you can exercise your privacy rights by electing

               information that would enable anyone to contact you via telephone, email or U.S. Mail.  (A "cookie" is a small piece of information which a website stores in the web
               browser of your PC and can later retrieve.  A "cookie" cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the "cookie".  You can set your web browser to inform
               you when "cookies" are set to prevent "cookies" from being set.)<br><br>

               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Disclosure of Personal Information.</strong><br><br>

               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may disclose all of the information that we collect, as described above.  We may disclose non-public
               information about you to the following types of third parties:<br><br>

               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have safeguards to keep your non-public personal information confidential and secure.  We restrict access
               to non-public personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.  We maintain physical,
               electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your non-public personal information.<br><br>

               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Our server is located behind a firewall/router to prevent unauthorized people from being able to retrieve any applicant data stored there.<br><br>
