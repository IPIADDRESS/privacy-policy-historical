        resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you.  Although we
        may disclose information we collect and retain, its use will be limited to what we 
        reasonably believe is appropriate and necessary to carry on our business and to facilitate
        your application for the services and/or products you expect and deserve.  In addition,
        unless you opt-out as specified herein, we may share the information with affiliates or
