    </p>

    <h5>The My.jobs Platform</h5>

    <p>
        We share your job search activity and profile data with employers with whom you have

        interacted via our services. Employers may use your job search activity and profile data to send

        you messages, such as job opportunities, hiring events, career fairs, and general information

        about their company. Employers may also export your profile data to load into career marketing,

        customer relationship management, and applicant tracking systems. You may opt-out or decline

        such sharing of information by updating your <a href="https://secure.my.jobs/account/edit/">account settings</a>.
    </p>

    <h5>Service Providers</h5>

    <p>
        We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with

        our business activities such as offering customer service or sending emails. These companies are

        authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us and

        are contractually obligated to keep your information confidential.
    </p>

    <h5>Legal Disclaimer</h5>

    <p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
        <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request</li>
        <li>if DE is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information</li>
        <li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User Access and Choice</h3>

    <p>
        If your personal information changes, you may correct, update, amend, remove, or ask to have

        it removed by making the change on your user <a href="https://secure.my.jobs/account/edit/">account settings</a> page or by submitting a service

        request via the My.jobs <a href="https://secure.my.jobs/contact/">Contact</a> page. You may deactivate or delete your account from the

        account settings page at any time, or contact us directly. We will respond to your request within

        30 days.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide

        you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal

        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
    </p>

    <h5>Opt-out Preferences</h5>

    <p>
        If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send

        the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our

        newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these

        emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us via

        the My.jobs <a href="https://secure.my.jobs/contact/">Contact</a> page.
    </p>

    <h5>Tracking Technologies / Cookies</h5>

    <p>
        A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.

        We use cookies on our sites to identify and track visitors, their usage of our websites, and their

        website access preferences across multiple requests and visits. We link the information we store

        in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
    </p>

    <p>
        We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you

        close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period

        of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet

        browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but the functionality

        of some areas of our site will be limited.
    </p>

    <h5>Web Beacons / Pixels</h5>

    <p>
        The analytics service we employ uses a software technology called clear pixels (a.k.a. Web

        Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is

        effective. Clear pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,

        and are used to track the online activities of website users. In contrast to cookies, which are

        stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear pixels are embedded invisibly on web pages and are

        about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear

        pixels to your personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h5>Analytics / Log Files</h5>

    <p>
        As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log

        files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service

        provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream

        data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends,

        to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic

        information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to

        personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h5>3<sup>rd</sup> Party Tracking</h5>

    <p>
        The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3<sup>rd</sup> party

        assets (such as social media) on the site is not covered by our privacy policy. These 3<sup>rd</sup> parties

        may use cookies, clear pixels, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content

        on our site. We do not have access or control over these technologies. We do not tie the

        information gathered to your personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h5>Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting</h5>

    <p>
        We may partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website or to

        manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to

        collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites

        to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this

        information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">here</a>.

        Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive

        generic ads.
    </p>

    <h3>Security</h3>

    <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive

        information (such as your username and password) in our log-in portal, we encrypt the

        transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
    </p>

    <p>
        We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us,

        both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet,

        or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its

        absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you may contact us

        using the My.jobs Contact page.
    </p>

    <h3>Additional Information</h3>

    <h5>Links to 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Sites</h5>

    <p>
        Our sites include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of DE.

        If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their

        privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
    </p>

    <h5>Testimonials</h5>

    <p>
        We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other

        endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you

        wish to update or delete your testimonial, you may contact us using the My.jobs Contact page.
    </p>

    <h5>Social Media Widgets</h5>

    <p>
        Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button, links to our

        various social media pages and Widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs

        that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are

        visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media

        Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your

        interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
    </p>

    <h5>Changes To This Policy</h5>

    <p>
        We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we

        make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified

        in your account) or by means of a notice on this site prior to the change becoming effective.

        We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy

        practices.
