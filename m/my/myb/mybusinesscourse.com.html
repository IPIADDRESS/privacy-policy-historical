<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We are committed to protecting the privacy of student records and other personal information provided in connection with the use of our products and services. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.</p>

<h4><a href="#outline">Outline</a></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.</li>
    <li>We will not violate the privacy rights of students as established by the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) at 20 U.S.C. 1232g and 34 C.F.R. part 99.</li>
    <li>We will collect and use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.</li>
    <li>We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.</li>
    <li>We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.</li>
    <li>Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</li>
    <li>The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web site, productions, services, and programs to the public, suppliers, and our clients, and may be used to contact you via e-mail or by regular mail, and to provide you with information that we believe to be of interest to you. </li>

    <li>We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.</li>
    </ul>

<h4><a href="#disclosure">Disclosure</a></h4>

We do not sell or transfer the information you send to us to others outside of our company, except that your data may be transferred to an outside vendor during the normal course of system backups or application maintenance and development. Our vendors are prohibited from using or selling your personal data for any purposes other than to support myBusinessCourse. </p>
<p>The collected information will be shared with a 3rd party in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service or as otherwise requested by law. </p>
<p>We may transfer information about you if myBusinessCourse is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, myBusinessCourse will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

            <p>Please ensure that your code is being entered correctly. A common issue is the confusion of certain characters. We tend to see capital "I's" as in Iowa confused with lowercase "l's" like leopard and/or the number "1".</p>
            <p>Our access codes do not contain lowercase "l's" (leopard) or the number "1"; in these cases, please use a capital "I" (Iowa).</p>
            <p>Another reason may be that you have a used textbook and the code is no longer valid. You can purchase course only access on myBusinessCourse.</p>

            <p>This indicates that information on file with an issuing credit card company does not match what is entered. We typically see this occur with individuals who have moved recently or individuals using a school address instead of a home address.</p>
            <p>Our advice is to contact your financial institution and verify the correct billing information. You may want to ask about any failed transactions and inquire as to the status of those funds.</p>
