		<h1>
			We take your privacy seriously.</h1>
		<p>
			<strong style="font-size: 14px;">Our Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal
				information when you use our service.</strong> When you log onto www.myBlueprint.ca
			using the Activation Key provided to you by your school and create a “My Profile”
			(profile), which allows you to create goals and plans of action, save high school
			plans, track your progress towards graduating, save post-secondary opportunities
			and occupations of interest and other education planning related features, we collect
			the following personal information: your name, email address, gender, postal code
			and grade. We also ask you about your preferences for using our site, including
			whether or not you wish to receive newsletters and other information by email. To
			personalize your profile and to enable potential features, we may in the future
			ask you for your date of birth, place of birth, student number and information about
			your hobbies and interests, but you are under no obligation to provide that information.
			We will also know, from your Activation Key, your school and the city and province
			in which you go to school, and we may combine that information with information
			we have from your profile.</p>
		<p>
			We collect this information for a number of purposes: to send you occasional newsletters,
			if you choose to receive them, to customize the content that you see, to provide
			you with information on a variety of subjects including scholarships, jobs and health
			information, to conduct surveys on topics that are relevant to you and to conduct
			promotions in which contestants may win prizes. You can elect, when you create your
			profile, whether or not you wish to receive information from us by email, and you
			can change that selection at any time.</p>
		<p>
			<strong style="font-size: 14px;">We will not use your personal information for any other
				purpose without your consent (unless we are required to do so by law).</strong></p>
		<h1>
			Cookies</h1>
		<p>
			We collect non-personal information and data automatically through the standard
			operation of our Internet servers and through the use of “cookies”. Cookies are
			small text files containing a unique identification number that identifies your
			browser - but not you - to our servers each time you visit our website. Cookies
			are not pervasive or invasive programs that enter a user’s system and damage files.
			They simply tell us which pages of our website are visited and by how many visitors.
			Cookies cannot, by themselves, disclose the individual identity of any user, and
			we never combine information gathered by a cookie with personally identifiable information
			like your name, telephone number or email address, without your consent.</p>
		<h1>
			Use of Information by Others</h1>
		<p>
			<strong style="font-size: 14px;">We do not sell your personal information.</strong>
			We do not share it with others unless we have your permission to do so and, in some
			cases, if it has been approved by your School Board.</p>
		<p>
			We may permit others to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through
			our website. Doublethink Inc. is not responsible for any actions or policies of
			such third parties, and you should check the privacy policy of such party before
			providing any personal information. We may transfer your personal information if
			Doublethink Inc. is acquired by or merged with another company; in that case, we
			will notify you prior to your personal information being transferred.</p>
		<h1>
			External Links</h1>
		<p>
			This website contains links or references to other websites to which this privacy
			policy does not apply. These sites are not owned or controlled by us and we are
			not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information or
			the privacy practices of other parties or other websites to which our site may refer
			visitors or provide links. When submitting personal information on other websites,
			we encourage you to read the privacy policy of those sites.</p>
		<h1>
			Confidentiality and Security</h1>
		<p>
			We use physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.
			Profiles have been designed to automatically log off after a specific period of
			inactivity in order to provide additional protection against unauthorized access
			by others. However, no security measures are perfect and we cannot be held liable
			if security is breached by an End User or any other person.</p>
		<p>
			We limit access to your personal information to employees who reasonably need to
			come in contact with that information for the purposes set out above.</p>
		<h1>
			Updating Your Account Information</h1>
		<p>
			If you want to update your personal information, use the “Account Details” section
			in your profile and make changes online.</p>
		<h1>
			Opt-Out Option</h1>
		<p>
			You can stop using our website at any time. You may cancel your account by clicking
			the “Cancel Account” button the Account Details section in your profile. Upon your
			request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete your
			personal information from our database. However, it may be impossible to delete
			a user's entry without some residual information because of backups and records
			of deletions.</p>
		<h1>
			Your Consent</h1>
		<p>
			We will not collect or use your personal information without your consent (unless
			we are required to do so by law). By agreeing to the provisions of the End User
			License Agreement, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you
			are consenting to the collection and use of your personal information as set out
			in this Privacy Policy. You may withdraw your consent to our collection and use
			of your personal information at any time, subject to contractual and legal restrictions
			and reasonable notice. However, please note that if you withdraw your consent to
			certain uses of your personal information, we may no longer be able to provide products
			or services to you.</p>
		<h1>
			Minors</h1>
		<p>
			When a person under age 13 attempts to create a profile on www.myBlueprint.ca, a
			parent or legal guardian must contact us to provide consent to the collection and
			use of the user’s personal information. We will not contact individuals under age
			13 for marketing purposes without the permission of a parent or legal guardian.</p>
		<h1>
			Contacting Us</h1>

			If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, or if you would
			like to review your personal information, you can contact us at:</p>

			on damages, arbitration and application of the laws of the Province of Ontario.
