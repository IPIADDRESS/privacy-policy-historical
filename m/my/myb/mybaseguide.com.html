				        <a name="top"></a>
Effective Date: April 10, 2008
<p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of mybaseguide.com ("we" or "us"). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the mybaseguide.com website (the "Site"), and the ways in which we use and don't use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children's privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail). In addition, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any activities (online or otherwise) of the printed publication.<br><br>
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.

<h3>1. Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>California Civil Code Section  1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our  customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a  year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we  disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding  calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the  categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses  of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately  preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to  make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:<br>

<h3>2. What Information is Collected About Visitors?</h3>
<p>The information that we collect about  you while you are using the Site falls into two general categories:<br>
   <br>
  1. <em>Information You Provide to Us.<br>
  <br>
</em>We  may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily  supply either while on the Site or in responding via email in connection with a  feature provided on the Site. </p>
<p>Some examples of this type of  information include demographic information that you electronically submit when  you sign up for access to certain features on the Site, information (such as  your name or email address) that you electronically submit when you register  for requests on the Site and information contained in search requests or  questions that you submit to the Site. If you decline to supply or provide us  with certain information while using the Site, you may not be able to use or  participate in some or all of the features offered through the Site. <br>
  <br>
2. <em>Information that is  Automatically Collected. </em><br>
<br>
We also collect and store  information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Site.  For example, to enhance your experience on the Site, we use a standard feature  found in browser software called a "cookie." Cookies are small files  that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By  showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us track user trends  and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on  certain areas of the Site where you have entered preference information before.  mybaseguide.com also uses web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also  known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who  visit the Site or open our HTML-formatted email messages. Another example of  information that we automatically collect as you navigate the Site is  information about your computer's connection to the Internet. This information  allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you  and to measure traffic on the Site. <br>
<br>
In addition, third party advertisers  or third party ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also  may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or  similar technologies. These third party advertisers and ad servers may use the  information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure  and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other uses. The use and  collection of your information by these third party advertisers and ad servers  is governed by the relevant third party's privacy policy and is not covered by  our privacy policy. Indeed, the privacy policy of these third party advertisers  and ad servers may be different from our privacy policy.</p>

<h3>3. How is this Information Used?</h3>
<p>We use the information we collect  from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including using the  information to customize features and advertising that appear on the Site. We  also may provide your information to third parties, such as service providers,  contractors, and advertisers, for a variety of purposes. For example, we may  provide our advertisers with information about you and other visitors that will  enable our advertisers to better target ads to specific types of visitors.<br>
  <br>
We reserve the right to use and to  disclose to third parties all of the information that we collect online about  you and other visitors in any way and for any purpose. The Site includes links to other websites and  provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose  privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase  third party products or services through the Site, use of any information you  provide is governed by the privacy policy of  the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or  services. <br>
<br>
We also make some content, products  and services available through our Site through cooperative relationships with  third party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear on the  Site in connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share  with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in  the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with  our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect  information from you directly; in which cases the privacy policy of the  provider partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your information.  The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have  any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you  should contact the provider partner directlyfor more information. In addition,  certain affiliated divisions provide online services that are separate from our  Site and may be subject to privacy policies that are different from ours. If  you have any question about the privacy policy that applies to the online  service you are using, you should click on the relevant link on the page of the  service that you are using.<br>
<br>
Be aware that we may occasionally  release information about visitors when release is appropriate to comply with  law, to enforce our Terms of  Service agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of users  of the Site, the public, or mybaseguide.com.<br><br>
Please also note that as our  business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that  we sell some or all of our assets, or our site is acquired by another company,  information about our visitors may be among the transferred assets.<br>

<h3>4. Children's Privacy Statement?</h3>

</p><ul>
	<li>
   This Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site. We screen users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing such information.

If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site.    </li>
    <li>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable       information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site,       we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.</li>
    <li>We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of       thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable       contact information through the Site. </li>
    <li>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable       information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site,       we do NOT condition the participation of a child under thirteen in the       Site's online activities on providing personally identifiable information. </li>
