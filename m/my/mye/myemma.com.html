<td class="bodycopy">Here at Emma<span class="bodycopy"><sup>®</sup></span>, we're dedicated to protecting your privacy and the privacy of anyone on the receiving end of an Emma<span class="bodycopy"><sup>®</sup></span>-delivered email. To that end, we have instituted certain policies – rules, you might call them – to help us make sure Emma<span class="bodycopy"><sup>®</sup></span> remains a safe, trusted environment for email marketing and correspondence.
<p>This document outlines those policies and our efforts to enforce them.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Spam, UCE and Other Bad, Bad Things</b><br>
Emma<span class="bodycopy"><sup>®</sup></span> is a permission-based email-marketing platform. It is designed to let businesses and organizations send emails to people who have clearly indicated their desire to receive said emails from said businesses and organizations. We do not allow anyone to send Unsolicited Commercial Emails (UCEs), spam, or anything that appears to be a UCE or spam. Anyone who uses Emma<span class="bodycopy"><sup>®</sup></span> to send unsolicited emails will have his or her Emma<span class="bodycopy"><sup>®</sup></span> privileges immediately revoked. If you suspect someone is abusing this policy in any way, please notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:abuse@myemma.com">abuse@myemma.com</a>.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Your Personal Information</b><br>
In order to create and administer your Emma<span class="bodycopy"><sup>®</sup></span> account, we explicitly ask for and collect certain information about you and your company, including financial information used to verify identity and bill for services. Under no circumstances will we share your (or any other member's) personal information with any third party, except in the circumstance where the requesting organization is a high-powered government agency with the authority and requisite threats of long-term jail sentences to make us share that personal information. Otherwise, no one gets access to your information, ever.</p>
<p>We also collect certain aggregate information about our customers. We use this information to improve our services and do a better job of marketing them. We may also report such information – always in aggregate form and never in a way that could identify individuals - to third parties, such as newspapers or industry observers or potential customers and partners.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Your Customer Lists and Data</b><br>
We do everything we can to make sure your customer lists, email content and response data remains private and confidential. Though we reserve the right to monitor your lists, content and response data from time to time to make sure they comply with our Terms of Use, we will never share, sell or rent your customer data to anyone for any reason. It makes us feel icky just thinking about it.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Your Email Address</b><br>
Just as we ask and expect you to respect the in-box of your customers, we will do our best to respect yours. The only emails you'll receive from us will be emails related to your account or your use of Emma<span class="bodycopy"><sup>®</sup></span>. We might alert you to new features or site enhancements. We might check in to see how your last campaign went. Some of those emails may be directed to everyone, and some of them may be written just for you. In the future, we may also ask if you'd like to receive information from our partners. We do not have partners, and until we do, we will not ask.</p>
<p>We will not sell your email address. We will not rent it. We will not loan it out for the afternoon.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Billing Transactions</b><br>
You are asked to supply certain credit card and billing information in order to purchase Emma<span class="bodycopy"><sup>®</sup></span> services. That information is transferred, using the most secure transmission technology, to a trusted third party for processing. The information is then encrypted using Data Encryption Standard 3 (Triple DES) and securely stored to handle your transactions. Your credit card information is not stored on the Emma<span class="bodycopy"><sup>®</sup></span> website or in our database. We do not have access to your credit card information, and we do not know whether you chose the Flowers or Picket Fence motif for your card design, though our personal preference is for the Picket Fence.</p>
<p><br>
<b>To Sum Up</b><br>
Your privacy, and the privacy of people on both sides of Emma<sup>® </sup>emails, is extremely important to us, and we'll do everything we can to protect it. Direct any questions you may have regarding this Privacy Policy to <a href="mailto:privacy@myemma.com">privacy@myemma.com</a>.</p>
