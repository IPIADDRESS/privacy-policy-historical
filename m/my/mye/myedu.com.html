    <strong>PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Updated 3 May 2013.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    This Privacy Statement and accompanying Terms of Use Agreement replace the previous version of 22 February 2013.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    Key changes are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">
            Removal of language associated with MyEdu’s mobile app and ClassMe (no longer in use)

        <p align="JUSTIFY">
            Modifications to default Privacy Settings

<p align="JUSTIFY">
    Privacy matters to us at MyEdu and we trust it does to you, too. MyEdu's mission is to provide you with the best possible product, tools, services, and
    opportunities for mapping out your college experience and to poise you for a successful transition into your career. The more complete your MyEdu Profile and the more visibility it garners,
    the greater the opportunity for success. To that end, we want to ensure you understand how we manage the important data that you provide.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    We need you to acknowledge your understanding of our Privacy Statement and Terms of Use Agreement before becoming a Member and we encourage you to keep
    current on Privacy considerations. We have myriad options for you related to your Privacy Settings – you control who (students, potential employers, the general public, etc.)
    can view your Profile. If you're an existing Member and are checking in to educate
    yourself on any new information, thank you. Knowledge IS power! Please be sure you read and understand this information as, by accessing, using or continuing
    to use the website, you acknowledge that you agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and understand MyEdu's Privacy Statement. If you don't agree to the
    Terms of Use or if you don’t understand the Privacy Statement, please do not register as a Member. If you are already a Member, and don't agree to the
    revised Terms of Use Agreement and/or understand the updated Privacy Statement, please suspend your account.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    As MyEdu believes your Privacy and our compliance with regulations related to Privacy are so important, we have a robust program in place. Given our comprehensive program, any changes to our Privacy Statement or Terms of Use will be minor unless there is a
    significant change in best practices, regulations, legislation, or our products and services. With that in mind, our Privacy Statement may be modified to
    reflect these changes and we encourage you to check back periodically. We'll be transparent when changes occur and will highlight the key modifications
    along with the date of revision. Any such revision will be effective immediately upon posting and your continued use of MyEdu’s website, services related 
    to our products and tools, and/ or any other MyEdu products or services constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. MyEdu no longer supports, and has 
    deactivated, the MyEdu for University of Texas at Austin mobile app and our Facebook ClassMe application so please uninstall them even though they are no 
    longer available

<p>
    <strong>Privacy Statement and Terms of Use Agreement Highlights:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
          MyEdu is compliant with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
          (“<a target="_blank" href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html"><u>FERPA</u></a>”).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">
            Our website contains links to external websites. We're not responsible for the content or privacy practices
            of these external websites so ensure you understand them. Many Social or Networking platforms, including Facebook, frequently modify their Privacy Setting
            options. You control these settings and it is important that you keep yours current and reflective of the level of access you want others to have
            to your data. Be sure you check your Privacy Settings for MyEdu products and services to ensure they correctly reflect your choices. If you want 
            to avail yourself of the products and services that will allow you to be most successful
            in college and as you move into your first job, you will want to make information that is important to employers accessible. Regardless of your
            Privacy Settings, MyEdu will always host, house, manage, and maintain your data in a manner that is fully compliant with all regulations.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">
            Our Privacy Statement and Terms of Use Agreement may be modified from time to time. Those modifications are effective as of the date they're posted
            to our website. If you continue to be a Member of MyEdu after any such changes (and we hope you will), your use of the website will constitute your
            consent to such modifications.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            While the default setting for your Profile is “Public,” YOU control what information you include on your Profile and with whom you share that information, 
            regardless of the platform. You can modify your Privacy Settings at any time.
          </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            There are services and features that may require you to either "opt-in" or "opt-out." Whether in conjunction with MyEdu or another service
            provider, make sure you understand what that involves.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If you “like” our Facebook page, access your MyEdu Profile via the Facebook interface, share your Profile via Twitter or other social
            media or networking platform, please make sure you understand the Privacy terms and settings of Facebook, Twitter or other social media
            or networking platform.
        </p>

            If, at any time, you have questions or feedback, please email <a href="mailto:member.support@myedu.com"><u>member.support@myedu.com</u></a>.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There is information we are required to provide you regarding our website. We want to share that information in a way that's easy to understand
    but also compliant. Bottom line is that we manage and safeguard your data in the same way we'd like our own to be managed and safeguarded.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Privacy Matters!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As part of our Privacy program, we ensure compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA") with respect to any data 
    that we collect or house that falls under FERPA criteria; this includes data you provide specific to your MyEdu Profile as well as
    anonymous data we may collect from various colleges in aggregate. So, while this data is considered Public Directory information,
    it still falls under the protection of FERPA. (Examples of Public Directory information include your date of birth, your university
    email address, name, etc.) We do not uniquely identify any individual based on data we collect from schools. The only method by
    which your Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") could reside on our servers is if you personally enter it as part of your
    MyEdu Profile or link your MyEdu profile with your Facebook profile either as part of initial registration or after initial 
    registration.
</p>
<p>
    Did you know? If you don't want your school to share your Public Directory information, you can generally restrict its release by contacting your
    registrar's office within specified time frames. If your school has a different process, the registrar's office can direct you to the right source. If
you'd like to better understand the full FERPA legislation, check it out here:    <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html"><u>FERPA</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
    How is Personally Identifiable Information defined and what does it mean to me as a student?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
        PII - is information that identifies a specific end user. When you create a MyEdu Profile and utilize the features of MyEdu's website such as
        participating in community and networking features, entering a contest, participating in a sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners,
        filling out a survey, providing a recommendation, sending us or our partners feedback, contacting Member Support or Privacy, or signing up for special
        offers from Third Parties through the website (legally these are referred to as "Identification Activities,") we may ask you to provide
        certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. If you choose to opt out of an Identification
        Activity, you must send an email to <u><a href="mailto:member.support@myedu.com">member.support@myedu.com</a></u> with a Subject line of "OPT OUT – Identification Activity."&nbsp;
        If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself,
        such as (but not limited to) your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number, and/ or date of birth.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            We may also collect PII about you from other MyEdu Members who have stored information about you when they elect to use our social networking, social media, or
            community features, or when they enable connectivity with another website or application where they have stored such information. For instance,
            your friends may have stored information about you in places such as their friends lists, address books, or photos on the website and other
            websites with which MyEdu interacts. In addition, when you access the website through a service partner, we may automatically collect certain
            aspects of your registration information (such as your email address or Profile image). Pay close attention to your Privacy Settings in all forms
            of social media and networking. You manage who can see, have access to, or collect your data.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide you with "best fit" services, enhance the operation of the website, improve our marketing and
            promotional efforts, analyze website use, and to tailor your experience with Third Parties. For example, if you send an email to MyEdu's Member
            Support team, we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment on MyEdu's website. In addition,
            if you use our website to post your class schedule for example, we may store that information. We may also use
            PII to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with
            you, including our website's Terms of Use Agreement and this Privacy Statement, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement
            activities.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Non-PII is information that does not identify a specific end user. This type of information may include things like
            the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving
            MyEdu's website, the type of browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service
            Providers and partners, may automatically collect this information when you visit our website through the use of electronic tools like cookies
            as described further in this Privacy Statement.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            We use Non-PII to troubleshoot, administer the website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with
            applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities if required. We may also share this information with approved Third Party Service
            Providers and partners, as described above, to measure the overall effectiveness of our website and features.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

    <strong>MYEDU’S PRIVACY PRINCIPLES </strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>WE ONLY COLLECT INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED, AND WE TELL YOU HOW WE USE IT.</strong>
            We limit the collection of information to what we need to know to support the products and services to which you subscribe and to provide you with the

            for which you subscribed to our services or as required by law or regulations. Thereafter, we dispose of or purge your information in compliance
            with all document destruction or record retention requirements and guidelines. Implicit to our Terms of Use Agreement and our Privacy Statement is
            that you acknowledge that while you may at some point in time choose to change your Privacy Settings or make your Profile Information
            private, or suspend your account, it may not be possible for us to purge your PII in its entirety because we perform routine back up functions. If you unsubscribe or
            suspend your service or account and inadvertently receive further communication from us, please let us know immediately by sending an email to

                    When you build a Profile on our website, you enter information that can be classified as either Non-PII or PII. There are different levels

                    You have ownership of your Profile and we encourage you to update it as necessary and to maintain a robust Profile. The more complete your
                    Profile, the better we can help you in your college experience and as you begin your career. Regardless of whether your Profile Information
                    is Non-PII or PII, we use every reasonable effort to protect it against loss, alteration, or any unauthorized use. With the increasing rise
                    of data vulnerability in general and the common knowledge that no computer system is 100% secure, it's important to us that you understand that we
                    make every effort to protect your data but that vulnerabilities always exist.

                    such as which pages you visited and on what links you clicked. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience.
                    Third Parties may display advertisements or provide targeted messaging on our website and they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control
                    over these cookies. As a reminder, our Privacy Statement covers the use of cookies by our website only and does not cover the use of

    We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our website pages and promotions, or we may allow our
    Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our
    website, or in our emails, that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email,
    pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of
    visitor traffic and behavior on our website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web
    beacons provided by our partners, Affiliates and/or Advertisers for the same purposes.

        While your Profile defaults to “Public,” you control the information that you privately or publicly share about yourself as a Member of MyEdu. 
        Based upon your settings, your information may be shared when utilizing services and/ or social networking features such

            We may share your information with authorized Third Party Service Providers and partners, including MyEdu for Employers. We provide some of our services and products through Third Parties.
            Examples are sending and distributing administrative and promotional emails. We may share your information to send postal or email communications,
            administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search
            results and links, support website operations and/ or provide customer service. The use of your PII by such parties is governed by the Privacy
            Policies and/ or Terms of Use Agreements with each Third Party and is not subject to our control. We urge you to review the Privacy Policies and/ or Terms of
            Use of any Third Parties to which you may be linked as we are not responsible for their policies or practices despite our best due diligence to
            partner only with companies, organizations and/ or entities whose policies and terms of use are of the highest, most compliant, standards. This is

            If MyEdu becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or part of its assets, we may share your information. If we do so,

            We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties such as our business partners, Affiliates, and Advertisers. For

You access your Profile or provide us with PII, using a password, a user ID, and/or your email address. Your password is encrypted. <em><strong>Please do not share your password with anyone</strong></em>. While your PII resides on a secure server to which only selected, “need-to-know”
    individuals have access, you are making yourself vulnerable when you share your password. No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network or
    device is 100% secure so, while we employ commercially reasonable and compliant information security and data protection measures to safeguard your data
    and to partner with companies who do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from our website. As mentioned
    previously, we aren't responsible for the actions of any Third Parties who may receive any such information.

    We encourage you to keep your Profile Information current. The richer your Profile, the greater your opportunities for success in school and with MyEdu for Employers when looking for that the ideal job or internship.

            Employees are expected to report violations, breaches, or suspected breaches of privacy or potential system vulnerabilities. MyEdu has a documented process in place for reporting,

<p>
    We are continually reviewing the ever-evolving Privacy landscape to ensure our Principles and privacy practices are best in class and compliant with
    all legal and regulatory requirements related to our business and our customers and that they make common sense. Whenever required or warranted, we

    anticipate their changing other than to be enhanced.

<p>
    <strong>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you are under the age of 13, do not attempt to register as a MyEdu Member and do not provide any information about yourself. If it comes to our
    attention that an individual under the age of 13 has established an account with MyEdu, we will delete that information and suspend the account within one
    business day. If you believe an individual who is 13 years of age or younger has established an account with MyEdu, please immediately contact
    <a href="mailto:member.support@myedu.com"><u>member.support@myedu.com</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
    We encourage minors who are 13 years of age or older to partner with their parents or obtain the permission of parents before signing up as a MyEdu Member
    or before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. We also encourage parents to educate their teens about safe Internet use
    practices. We reserve the right to add special protections for minors in order to provide them with an age-appropriate experience. This includes, but is
    not limited to, placing restrictions on the ability of an adult to share and connect with minors. Please understand that this may provide minors a more
    limited experience with MyEdu but we choose to err on the side of caution in safeguarding a minor's information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Notice of Privacy Rights to California Residents.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    California law requires that we provide you with a summary of your privacy rights under the California Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA" or the "Act") and the

    Information we collect and with whom we share that information; (2) the names and addresses of those Third Parties; and (3) examples of the products
    marketed by those companies. The Act further requires us to allow you to control those with who you do not want us to share that information. To obtain this
    information, please send a request by email to <a href="mailto:privacy@myedu.com">privacy@myedu.com</a> or standard mail to 1301 South MoPac Expressway, Suite 250, Austin, Texas 78746,

<p>
    By providing any Personally Identifiable Information to MyEdu, all users, including, without limitation, users in Canada and the Member states of the
    European Union, fully understand and consent to MyEdu's Terms of Use Agreement and Privacy Statement and to the transfer of such Personally Identifiable
    Information across international borders in accordance with MyEdu's standard operations, including the collection, storage, and processing of such

</p>
<p>
    <strong>These privacy principles also extend to our business partners including vendors and Third Party service providers</strong>. From time to time, we partner with outside sources to fulfill our contractual responsibilities. All partners with whom we do business are contractually
    required to keep your information confidential and secure and to protect against unauthorized access or use. Their use of your information is strictly
    limited to the purposes for which we provide it to them or you make it available or accessible to them.
    We make every effort to only partner with companies that have privacy policies and practices as strong as our own.
    We continually monitor and participate in educational and industry Privacy and Information Security organizations and associations, both locally and nationally, to ensure the most informed,
