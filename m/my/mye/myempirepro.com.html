    <h3 align="center">More Information About Our Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>myEmpirePRO.com is dedicated to keeping your details   private. Any information, we collect in relation to you, is kept   strictly secured. We do not pass on/sell/swap any of your personal   details with anyone. We use this information to identify your orders,   provide you with our monthly newsletter (if applicable) and to   personalise your shopping experience with us; that’s all. </p>
    <p>myEmpirePRO.com uses cookies to allow you to login to your   account, maintain a shopping cart and to purchase items in your shopping   cart. Cookies sent to your computer from myEmpirePRO.com only   last while you’re browsing our website. </p>
    <p>We do not store persistent cookies on your computer. Cookies also   allow us to give you a more personalised shopping experience by   displaying products that interest you throughout our product pages, thus   providing you with a more friendly, interesting and enjoyable shopping   experience. </p>
    <p>Whenever you use our web site, or any other web site, the computer on   which the web pages are stored (the Web server) needs to know the   network address of your computer so that it can send the requested web   pages to your Internet browser. The unique network address of your   computer is called its “IP address,” and is sent automatically each time   you access any Internet site. </p>
    <p>From a computer’s IP address, it is possible to determine the general   geographic location of that computer, but otherwise it is anonymous. </p>
    <p>We do not keep a record of the IP addresses from which users access   our site except where you have specifically provided us with information   about yourself, in which case we also record your IP address for   security purposes. An example of this would be when proceeding to a   checkout to finalise an order you may wish to make. After completing the   form provided, your IP address will be stored along with a transaction   number that allows us to track your order. </p>
