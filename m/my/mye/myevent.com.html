		<p>This privacy policy applies to www.myevent.com and www.websiteworks.com, owned and operated by MyEvent.com Inc. This privacy policy describes how MyEvent.com Inc. collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Websites. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>
		<p>The visitors and the customers (the "User") of the MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com websites are in control of the use of information they provide to MyEvent.com, Websiteworks.com, or one of its current or future affiliate members ("Affiliate Members"). MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com are committed to respecting the privacy rights of Users to the MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com websites (the "Site").</p>
		<p>While visiting the Site, we may ask Users to provide personal information ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the Site. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
		<p>Please see the Effective Date stated at the conclusion of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from Users. To the extent that Users disclose any such information to other parties, through other web sites on the Internet linked to this site or otherwise, THIS PRIVACY POLICY SHALL NOT APPLY TO SUCH DISCLOSURE. Since MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com do not control the privacy policies of third parties (including Affiliate Members), Users are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of that third party, and MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of Personal Information by that third party. Therefore, we encourage Users to ask questions before they disclose Personal Information to other parties.</p>
		<h5>Information Collected</h5>

		<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.
