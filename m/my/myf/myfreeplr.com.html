            knowingly collect personal information from children under the age 
            of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child 
            under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our

            kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience 
            safer: <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Teach kids never to give personal information, unless 
              supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, 
              address, phone, school, etc. </li>
              <li>Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are 
              appropriate. </li>
              <li>Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's 
              information is treated.</li></ul>Check out the FTC's site <http: index.html="" kidzprivacy="" edcams="" conline="" bcp="" www.ftc.gov="">for more tips
