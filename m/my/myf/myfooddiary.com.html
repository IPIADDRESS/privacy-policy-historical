<div style="font-size:15px; line-height:150%; max-width:40em;">
    <div style="font-size:1.2em; color:#666; margin-bottom:1em;">Information Collection &amp; Use</div>
    <strong>Membership Registration</strong>
    <p>In order to access the members' section of this Web site, you must first complete the membership form and create a user name and password.&nbsp; During registration you are required to enter personal information (such as name, email address, weight, and height).&nbsp; We use this information to verify your credit card billing address, calculate your metabolic rate, and send you a welcome email.</p>

    <p>MyFoodDiary and its parent company, Aligned Web Solutions, Inc., are the sole owners of the information collected on this site.</p>

    <strong>Orders</strong>

    <p>If you purchase a product from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form.&nbsp; You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).</p>

    <p>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders.&nbsp; If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>

    <p>We will send emails to you as necessary to keep you informed on the status of your order.</p>

    <strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong>

    <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.&nbsp; We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.&nbsp; We do not store this information and will not distribute it to any third parties.</p>
    
    <strong>Affiliates</strong>
    
    <p>In order to join our Affiliate Program, you will need to provide your contact information and Web site address.&nbsp; We use this information to aid in the tracking of and payment for the referrals received from your Web site.&nbsp; Your information will not be distributed to any third parties.&nbsp; Affiliates will not have access to our members' Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</p>

    <div style="font-size:1.2em; color:#666; margin-top:0.8em;">Uses of Information</div>
    
    <p>We collect billing &amp; contact information and personal food, exercise, and body data.&nbsp; We recognize that this information is highly personal and we take several precautions to help protect you and your personal information.&nbsp; We do not distribute your personally identifiable information to any third parties -- except when required to process your order (e.g., credit card processors and shipping companies).</p>

    <div style="font-size:1.2em; color:#666; margin:0.8em 0 1em 0;">Communications from the Site</div>
    
    <strong>Newsletters</strong>

    <p>From time to time, we may use your name and email address to send a newsletter to you.&nbsp; Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.&nbsp; Simply click the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email.</p>

    <strong>Customer Service</strong>
    
    <p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcome email.&nbsp; We will also correspond with you via email in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.</p>
    
    <div style="font-size:1.2em; color:#666; margin:0.8em 0 1em 0;">Information Sharing and Disclosure</div>

    <strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong>
    
    <p>We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our affiliates.&nbsp; This information does not identify individual users.&nbsp; For example, we may tell an affiliate the gender distribution of our membership.</p>

    <p>We may also publish analyses of the data collected on our Web site.&nbsp; For example, we may display a graph showing the average weight loss of our members over time.&nbsp; These analyses will not contain any personally identifiable information.</p>

    <strong>Personally identifiable information:</strong>

    <p>We only share Personally Identifiable Information when required to complete your order.&nbsp; For example, we send your billing information to our credit card processor.&nbsp; If we are shipping a package, we will provide your postal address to our shipping company.</p>

    <p>We will not sell or distribute your personal information to third parties when not required to complete your order.</p>

    <strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong>
    
    <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>

    <div style="font-size:1.2em; color:#666; margin-top:0.8em;">Log Files</div>
    
    <p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp; This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>

    <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>

    <p>In addition, we record your IP address with your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; We do so to help protect ourselves and our members from abusive users of our site.</p>

    <p>We use third-party tracking services that use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.&nbsp; We do so in order to track our return on marketing initiatives.</p>

    <div style="font-size:1.2em; color:#666; margin-top:0.8em;">Cookies</div>
    
    <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.&nbsp; We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.</p>

    <p>We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.&nbsp; A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser or when you have been inactive for 20 minutes or longer.&nbsp; If you reject session cookies, you will not be able to use the members' section of our site.</p>

    <p>Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time.&nbsp; If you select the "remember me" option when logging into our members' section, a persistent cookie will be used to allow you to bypass the log in process in the future.&nbsp; We also use persistent cookies to help us track how new members find our site.&nbsp; You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.</p>

    <div style="font-size:1.2em; color:#666; margin-top:0.8em;">Links to Other Sites</div>
