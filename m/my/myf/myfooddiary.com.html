            <h1 style="margin-bottom:.7em;">Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p style="font-size:1.1em;"><strong>MyFoodDiary respects your privacy.</strong> We do not sell or distribute your personal data to any third parties â€” except when required to process your order (such as credit card processors and shipping companies).  The privacy policy below outlines our use of personally identifiable data. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us using our <a href="/support">contact form</a>.</p>
            
    <h4>Information Collection &amp; Use</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <strong>Membership Registration</strong>
        <p>In order to access the members' section of this Web site, you must first complete the membership form and create a login ID and password. During registration you are required to enter personal information (such as name, email address, and payment information). We use this information to verify your credit card billing address, calculate your metabolic rate, and send you a welcome email.</p>

        <p>MyFoodDiary and its parent company, Aligned Web Solutions, Inc., are the sole owners of the information collected on this site.</p>

        <strong>Orders</strong>

        <p>If you purchase a product from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).</p>

        <p>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>

        <p>We will send emails to you as necessary to keep you informed on the status of your order.</p>

        <strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong>

        <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not store this information and will not distribute it to any third parties.</p>
    
        <strong>Affiliates</strong>
    
        <p>In order to join our Affiliate Program, you will need to provide your contact information and Web site address. We use this information to aid in the tracking of and payment for the referrals received from your Web site. Your information will not be distributed to any third parties. Affiliates will not have access to our members' Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Uses of Information</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>We collect billing &amp; contact information and personal food, exercise, and body data. We recognize that this information is highly personal and we take several precautions to help protect you and your personal information. We do not distribute your personally identifiable information to any third parties -- except when required to process your order (e.g., credit card processors and shipping companies).</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Communications from the Site</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <strong>Newsletters</strong>

        <p>From time to time, we may use your name and email address to send a newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Simply click the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email.</p>

        <strong>Customer Service</strong>
    
        <p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcome email. We will also correspond with you via email in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong>
    
        <p>We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our affiliates. This information does not identify individual users. For example, we may tell an affiliate the gender distribution of our membership.</p>

        <p>We may also publish analyses of the data collected on our Web site. For example, we may display a graph showing the average weight loss of our members over time. These analyses will not contain any personally identifiable information.</p>

        <strong>Personally identifiable information:</strong>

        <p>We only share Personally Identifiable Information when required to complete your order. For example, we send your billing information to our credit card processor. If we are shipping a package, we will provide your postal address to our shipping company.</p>

        <p>We will not sell or distribute your personal information to third parties when not required to complete your order.</p>

        <strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong>
    
        <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Log Files</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>

        <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>

        <p>In addition, we record your IP address with your personally identifiable information. We do so to help protect ourselves and our members from abusive users of our site.</p>

        <p>We use third-party tracking services that use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. We do so in order to track our return on marketing initiatives.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.</p>

        <p>We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser or when you have been inactive for 20 minutes or longer. If you reject session cookies, you will not be able to use the members' section of our site.</p>

        <p>Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you select the "remember me" option when logging into our members' section, a persistent cookie will be used to allow you to bypass the log in process in the future. We also use persistent cookies to help us track how new members find our site. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Google Analytics</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>Google Analytics provides us with statistics about our site traffic.  We also use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online.  Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website.</p>

        <p>We will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless we have robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.</p>

        <p>Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Ads Settings</a> or by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by MyFoodDiary.com or Aligned Web Solutions, Inc. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

        <p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Discussion Forum</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>If you use the discussion forum on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of the forum, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, you may update it by making changes on the My Account page in the members' section of our site.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Security</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our membership or order forms, we encrypt that information using the latest Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology.</p>

        <p>In addition to the encryption technology that we employ, we also participate in daily security audits provided by multiple 3rd parties. These systems monitor our servers for vulnerabilities and alert us immediately if a weakness is found.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Business Transitions</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>In the event MyFoodDiary goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h4>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
