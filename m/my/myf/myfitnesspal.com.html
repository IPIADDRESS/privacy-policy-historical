<h1 class="main-title">MyFitnessPal.com Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>What's our policy?</strong><br>
MyFitnessPal.com takes your privacy seriously. We are committed to ensuring that the personal information we gather from you is secure and confidential. We do not sell, rent or trade our customers' personal data. </p>
<p> <strong>What type of information do we collect when you create a MyFitnessPal.com account? </strong><br>
The information we collect in order to create your MyFitnessPal.com account includes data such as your name and email address. The email address may be used to contact you with matters regarding MyFitnessPal, such as a newsletter, notifications of new messages from other MyFitnessPal members, or an announcement about a new product or service. We also collect some personal fitness information so that we can provide you with a personalized plan for successful weight loss. </p>
<p> <strong>What about other data?</strong><br>

By entering foods into your food diary or activities into your exercise log, you allow MyFitnessPal.com to provide you with a comprehensive analysis of your aggregate nutrition intake and fitness activity levels. It also allows us to plot for you charts of your weight, calorie intake and individual nutrient intake. <strong></strong></p>
<p>This information is not shared with anyone EXCEPT, from time to time; MyFitnessPal may create statistics based on users' diary entries, for example to determine what meal patterns have been most effective at losing weight among certain types of people. Your individual information will NEVER be shared with anybody else unless you provide your explicit consent (for instance, agreeing to become a “Friend” with another MyFitnessPal.com member to jointly lose weight and offer support to one another). As a condition to the consummation of a change in control or sale of substantially all the assets of MyFitnessPal to a third party, such third party shall agree to abide by the MyFitnessPal Privacy Statement. </p>
<p> <strong>What about MyFitnessPal.com's e-newsletter? </strong><br>
Our MyFitnessPal.com e-newsletter allows us to update you on new products, special offers and more. You can unsubscribe from the e-newsletter at any time by following the instructions at the bottom of the email. </p>
<p> <strong>Will MyFitnessPal.com share any of your personal information?</strong><br>
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. </p>
<p>MyFitnessPal.com will not trade, sell or rent your personal data. We also protect your privacy by limiting employee access to and use of customers' personal data. While we may provide statistics to outside companies about our customers, including sales and related site information, it will not include any personally identifiable information. </p>

<p> Except for the transfers outlined above, we will only share your personal data with third parties if: </p>
<ul id="privacy">
  <li> we have your consent; </li>
  <li> we consider that we are required to do so by law; </li>
  <li> we find that you are in breach of our terms and conditions or any of our policies or usage guidelines for specific products or services; </li>

  <li> it is necessary in our opinion to do so to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences or attacks on the technical integrity of our site(s) or our network; or </li>
  <li> it is necessary in our opinion to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of MyFitnessPal.com and its employees, the users of our site(s), or the public. </li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>How do we protect your information? </strong><br>
We make sure that every online communication with our customers meets our high standards of privacy and security. We do this by using a secure server with software that encrypts all of your confidential information before you send it to us. In addition, we take a range of measures to protect all customer data against unlawful or unauthorized access and have in place appropriate physical, technical and organizational security procedures to protect against damage, loss, destruction, misuse and alteration of customer data. </p>

<p> <strong>Do we collect and analyze web site traffic? </strong><br>
Yes. We use log file analysis tools, IP addresses, and outside services to collect and analyze our web traffic and shopping patterns. None of these tools personally identifies our visitors. They are used to help us understand our advertising effectiveness, enhance our web interface, and improve your overall online experience with MyFitnessPal.com. </p>
