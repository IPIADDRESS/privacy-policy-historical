    <h2>1.	CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h2>

    <p>MyFitnessPal does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If MyFitnessPal obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, MyFitnessPal will immediately delete such information from its database. Because MyFitnessPal does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, MyFitnessPal has no such information to use or disclose to third parties.</p>

  <li>
    <h2>2.	INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES </h2>

    <ol class="minor">
      <li><strong>(a)	Traffic Data.</strong>  MyFitnessPal automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website (collectively “<strong>Traffic Data</strong>”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify You.</li>  

      <li><strong>(b)	Cookies.</strong>  A “<strong>Cookie</strong>” is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website. MyFitnessPal uses Cookies to customize Your experience on the Website to Your interests, to ensure that You do not see the same advertisements or informational messages repeatedly, and to store Your password so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit the Website.
