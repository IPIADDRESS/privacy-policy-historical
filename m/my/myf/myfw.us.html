        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following 
          discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for 
          the myFW.com Web site.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
          What are Cookies?<br>
          Some Web sites store information in a small text file, called a "cookie," 
          on your hard disk.<br>
          Cookies contain information about You and your preferences. It might 
          only contain a record of which pages within the site You visited, to 
          help the site customize the view for You the next time You visit.<br>
          Only the information that You provide, or the choices You make while 
          visiting a Web site, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site 
          cannot determine Your e-mail name unless You choose to type it. Allowing 
          a Web site to create a cookie does not give that or any other site access 
          to the rest of Your computer, and only the site that created the cookie 
          can read it.<br>
          However, You can specify (in your browser) that You be prompted before 
          a site puts a cookie on your hard disk, so You can choose to allow or 
          disallow the cookie; or You can prevent Your browser from accepting 
          any cookies.<br>
          You can specify different settings for different security zones. For 
          example, You might want to allow Web sites to create cookies if they 
          are in your Trusted sites or Local intranet zone, prompt You before 
          creating cookies if they are in your Internet zone, and never allow 
          cookies if they are in Your Restricted sites zone.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At myFW.com 
          we use cookies to maintain Your user session, personalize your experience, 
          and extend certain functionality within the MyFW.com site. You may choose 
          not to use the cookies, in which case You will need to enter your password 
          each time you want to access Your personalized myFW.com member profile. 
          We do not store Your click stream profile or any other information collected 
          as part of the cookie in our database.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Security</strong><br>
          myFW.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse 
          and alteration of the information under our control. Your information 
          is stored in a server without direct Web access and is protected by 
          a firewall. <br>
          While data is at rest, we have put measures in place to protect sensitive 
          information from theft or misuse. <br>
          If You have concerns about the security of Your personal information 
          please write to us: privacy@myfw.com.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What 
          Information We Collect/How We Use It</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Contact 
          Information. myFW.com's registration form requests You provide contact 
          information (like Your name and e-mail address). Some of the requested 
          information is required in order to gain access to and use of some of 
          the services on myFW.com; other information is optional. The required 
          information is clearly marked as such on the registration pages. We 
          use Your information in four ways: <br>
          1. to send personalized, targeted information to the You in the form 
          of e-mail messages; <br>
          2. to send targeted advertising that allows us to provide our service 
          at no cost to You; <br>
          3. to contact You for feedback and surveys; and <br>
          4. to send You other information about myFW.com. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Profile 
          Data. Profile data is also collected at myFW.com. We use this data to 
          tailor Your myFW.com experience through our FW emails. By obtaining 
          this information, we can provide You with specific content that we think 
          you might be interested in, according to Your preferences and interests. 
          You may include only the information that you feel comfortable including. 
          However, the omission of certain information will limit the value of 
          the myFW.com experience for You (for example, if we do not have information 
          about Your specific interests, we will be unable to tailor specific 
          content for Your FW email.) As a result, the more information we have 
          about You, the more valuable the myFW.com experience will be for You.<br>
          We also use Your profile information in the same four ways described 
          in "Contact Information," above. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Third Party 
          Access to Your profile. As a rule we do not share any of your personal 
          profile information with third parties without Your permission. The 
          only case where Your personal information may be shared is when You 
          grant specific permission to share Your profile with a named third party 
          sponsor. You may (but are not required to) grant permission to contact 
          You with information during the registration process or in response 
          to a specific promotion. These sponsors are generally companies that 
          sell consumer products and services about which You may be interested. 
          The option for granting this permission is clearly marked on the registration 
          pages or in the promotional material on myFW.com. If You grant us permission 
          to share Your information with such third party sponsors, and then change 
          Your mind, You may revoke Your permission; see "Changing Your Status," 
          below. In addition, You can modify Your personal profile information 
          at any time; see "Changing Your Status," below.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reports. 
          We provide reports to a limited number of companies with which we do 
          business. These reports include aggregate information about our users. 
          The information in these reports will not identify You individually. 
          The outside companies who receive these reports will not be able to 
          contact You from the information contained in the reports. We will not 
          provide individual information to these companies without Your permission. 
          The purpose of these reports is to show the results of marketing campaigns 
          run on myFW.com.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Referral 
          Program. As part of our referral program, we request contact information 
          (like the name and e-mail address) of users friends and family whom 
          think would like to receive the services available on myFW.com. The 
          persons referred to us will receive a single promotional email inviting 
          them to visit myFW.com, but do not become members until they confirm 
          their interest in the service. The person referred does not have their 
          information stored on our servers and will not be contacted again unless 
          they register at myFW.com.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Links. 
          myFW.com contains links to other sites but is not responsible for the 
          privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. If you have a question 
          about the privacy policy of those Web sites, please visit them directly.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Contests. 
          We run contests on myFW.com in which we ask visitors for contact information 
          (like their name, e-mail address, and zip code). Sometimes we ask for 
          similar information about referrals; see "Referral Program," 
          above. We use and treat contact information from our contests as described 
          in "Contact Information" and "Profile Data," above.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Changing 
          Your Status</strong></font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          Because we want our users to feel completely comfortable using myFW.com, 
          we provide You with various opportunities to control how the information 
          You provide to us is used. myFW.com gives users the following options 
          to cancel our service and not receive future communications from us, 
          direct that we not share their information with third parties (in cases 
          where users previously granted us permission to share such information 
          - we do not share users' personal information with third parties without 
          their permission), have us remove their information from our database, 
          and change their profile information.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To unsubscribe 
          from our service, follow the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom 
          of any e-mail we send you. You will not receive any further communications 
          from us and your personal information will be automatically deleted 
          from our database.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To request 
          that we not share Your personal information with sponsors (in cases 
          where You previously granted us permission to share such information 
          - we do not share Your personal information with sponsors without Your 
          permission), You can send a blank email to nosponsor@myFW.com. The request 
          will be honored as soon as we receive it, but does not affect any information 
          which You provided to us and which we shared with sponsors prior to 
          our receipt of such request.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To have 
          all of Your personal information removed from our database, send an 
          email request to such effect to info@myFW.com. At the current time, 
          we are not able to offer users the direct ability to delete their personal 
          information from our database, but we will be happy to delete such information 
          after we receive a request to that effect.<br>
          If You would like to change any of Your profile information in our database, 
          you can do so by following the "My Profile" link at the bottom 
          of any email we send you, or by clicking the "My Profile" 
          button on our homepage (www.Myfw.com), and following the directions. 
          This will automatically change the information contained in our database.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You have 
          a right to know what information we have on record and to request a 
          copy of this information at anytime. If You want to know specifically 
          who has access to Your personal profile and specifically what information 
          we have on record, send an email to membercare@myfw.com requesting this 
          information. We will send You a copy as soon as possible.</font></p>
