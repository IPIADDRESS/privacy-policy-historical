	        <h3>Our Commitment to Privacy</h3>
	        <p>myfamily.com is one of a network of internet sites owned and operated by Ancestry.com Operations Inc. ("Ancestry.com", "Ancestry", "we", "our" or "us"). This statement is our company's commitment to you as a user of myfamily.com.</p>
	        <p>We recognize the potential sensitivity of confidential information that may be placed on member family Web sites and we are firmly committed to protecting your privacy.</p>
	        <p>Access to your data is limited to our authorized staff and is restricted by password protection mechanisms.

	        <h3>How We Use the Information We Collect:</h3>

            <ol>
				<li><b>How we use personal information that you give us</b>
		            <p>Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, user-friendly Web experience possible.</p>
		            <p>The personal information contained in any Content which you Post to the Service will obviously be shared with other family or friends who are invited to and are Members of your Private Family Web Site, or with other users who view your Public Family Web Site. The decision whether to designate your Family Web Site as a Private Family Web Site or a Public Family Web Site is always up to you. Likewise, your decision to post Content to any Web site is always up to you.</p>
		            <p>We will also use your email address and other Member registration information to advise you of new Members and new postings to your Family Web Site, to let you know about new features or other offers of interest from us or our affiliates or to address customer service needs and requests.</p>
		            <p>We currently don't allow children 13 or under to register for MyFamily.com 2.0 beta. So we ask everyone who signs up to certify that they're over the age of 13 by entering their birth date and accepting our terms and conditions.</p>
		            <p>In order to make site more relevant to you we also direct advertising from our sponsors according to the interests of our users. For instance, if you indicate an interest in cooking in your member profile, you may see an ad from Betty Crocker, while your brother, who likes sports, might see an Adidas ad. Ultimately, this makes the service far more valuable to each family member.</p>
		            <p>In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, <b>the advertiser never has access to individual account information. We do not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us for use by third parties for their use.</b> Advertisers simply give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old, or 18-34 year olds interested in outdoor sports). We then display the ad only to users who meet those criteria.</p>
				</li>
				<li><b>How we use financial information that you give us</b>
		            <p>The financial information you share with us is used by us in connection with processing your orders, and the payments made in respect of those orders, only, and for no other purposes. We will store the financial information you provide us initially (subject to your changes over time) in secure databases so that you may easily access it for future purchases. For our continuous subscription services which renew automatically, we use the financial information that we have on file for you to automatically process your payment on the payment due date.</p>
		            <p>If you have provided us with your financial information in connection with any products you have ordered or services which were rendered on our through our Web site, you may access that information with your username and password in order to make updates or changes to the information.</p>
				</li>
				<li><b>How we use information we collect automatically</b>
		            <p><b>IP Addresses:</b>  IP addresses define the Internet location of computers, and help us better understand the geographic distribution of our members and manage the performance of our website. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members.</p>
		            <p><b>MyFamily.com Cookies:</b>  Cookies are tiny files which are placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you visit our Web site, so that we can immediately recognize you when you return to the site. This enables us, among other things, to personalize your experience with our site. Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer.</p>
		            <p><b>Advertiser Cookies:</b>  Third party advertising banners on our Web site may also place cookies on your computer. These cookies are not placed or controlled by us. They are primarily used to provide data to the advertiser about where visitors are coming from.</p>
		            <p><b>Web logs:</b>  To learn about how people use our Web site, we examine Web logs, which show the paths people take through our site and how long they spend in certain areas. We also use Web logs to detect the type of Web browser you are using so that we can optimize the performance of our Web site and understand the mix of browsers which are used by our users, Members and Subscribers.</p>
