When you provide us with your telephone number, we may use the telephone number to send you the communications that you have requested to receive. If you decide to use certain features of the MyPurpleMartini.com network (like my page, testimonials, blogs and the like), some of the Personal Information you entered into your MyPurpleMartini.com profile and any information, including Personal Information, that you enter using one of these features, might be used and displayed.</p>

<p>Please be aware that the handling of your Personal Information by our partners or the third-party advertising companies is governed by their privacy policy, not ours.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you visit our Sites. These companies may use Personal Information, such as gender or age, and other information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites and other websites, such as time of day of the login, IP address or information about the internet service provider (ISP) or mobile device Carrier, in order to provide advertisements on the Sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</strong></p>
<p>As you navigate the Sites, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system.

<p>An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.

<p>Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on webpages within the MyPurpleMartini.com network. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong></p>
<p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees and third parties who we reasonably believe need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>
<p>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you and your MyPurpleMartini.com account information is protected by a password that you select..</p>
