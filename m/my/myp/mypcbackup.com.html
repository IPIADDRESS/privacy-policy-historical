			<h4 class="main">Sharing Your Personal Information</h4>
			<div class="small-pad border-rounded">
MPCB will not provide unaffiliated third parties with access to your email address or other contact information. MPCB or the MPCB Affiliates may, from time to time, share with you information about other products and services that we think you may find to be of interest. If you wish to change the types of communications you receive from us, you may do so by modifying your profile at www.MyPCBackup.com, by emailing your request to us at <a href="mailto:support@mypcbackup.com" title="">support@mypcbackup.com</a>, or by clicking on an appropriate link in any MPCB email communication to you.
<br><br>
MPCB may disclose your Personal Information to third parties if we believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with a law, regulation, or governmental or judicial warrant, rule, or order; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of MPCB; (3) enforce the MPCB Terms and Conditions of Use and/or this Privacy Policy. MPCB may also provide access to your Backup Data to government authorities if MPCB suspects or believes that the data contain child pornography or other prohibited data, or that the data or the MPCB Products or Services are being used for illegal purposes.

			<h4 class="main">Security for Your Personal Information</h4>
			<div class="small-pad border-rounded">
MPCB has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your Personal Information in our customer database. Personal Information provided to MPCB is stored in secure facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only. Although we make good faith efforts to store the Personal Information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to unauthorized users, we cannot guarantee complete security.
<br><br>
To provide secure credit card processing when ordering from us, orders placed on our Website are processed through a payment gateway which operates under its own privacy policy. If you choose to purchase or license MPCB Products or Services online using a credit card, the credit card information is sent to MPCB using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, an industry-standard method for protecting data as it travels over the Internet, or a similar encryption technology that may become accepted as an industry standard or better encryption method, in the future ("Transmission Encryption"). To learn more about our credit card processing vendors and their respective privacy and other policies (which are incorporated by reference into the MPCB Privacy Policy and Terms or Use by reference) email us at <a href="mailto:support@mypcbackup.com" title="">support@mypcbackup.com</a>.
<br><br>
MPCB encrypts the files that we process before they leave your computer. MPCB uses SSL or similar Transmission Encryption technology before sending your files to our data centers. Your encrypted backup files transmitted to our servers are stored in facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only. MPCB does not encrypt the file names or file type information.
<br><br>
By Using the MPCB Product that permits you to download your backed up files to any computer that has a connection to the Internet you understand that MPCB will be decrypting these files before they leave MPCBâ€™s servers and that once decrypted these files can be reviewed by anyone who may be able to access them.
<br><br>
MPCB will not decrypt your files unless i) it reasonably believes that it must do so to troubleshoot problems with the MPCB Products or Services or ii) it reasonably believes it must do so in order to comply with a law, subpoena, warrant, order, or a certification requirement, such as the requirements of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2703.
<br><br>
However, if you elect to Use MPCB Products or Services that permit you to access Backup Data from an Internet enabled computer other than by using MPCB Software on your registered computer, then your Backup Data will be decrypted by MPCB in its data center and sent to you in a decrypted form via public infrastructure. You election to use such products or services may make the contents of these files to accessible to individuals or entities other than you and those you intend. By using such products and services, you knowingly accept this risk.
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4 class="main">How You Can Access Or Correct Your Personal Information</h4>
			<div class="small-pad border-rounded">
You can access selected Personal Information that we collect online by selecting the "My Account" tab on our home page and logging in. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can correct factual errors in your Personal Information on our Web site or by sending a request (to <a href="mailto:support@mypcbackup.com" title="">support@mypcbackup.com</a>) that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

<br><br>

			<h4 class="main">Privacy Principles Applicable to European Personal Information</h4>
			<div class="small-pad border-rounded">
MPCB will process European Personal Information in accordance with the following principles:
<br>
				<ul class="realul">
					<li>NOTICE. Where MPCB collects Personal Information directly from individuals in the EEA, we will inform them about the purposes for which we collect and use their Personal Information, the types of non-agent third parties to which MPCB may disclose that information, and the choices and means, if any, MPCB offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to MPCB, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before MPCB uses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.
					</li>
					<li>CHOICE. Where MPCB collects Personal Information directly from individuals in the EEA, MPCB will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their Personal Information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, MPCB will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. MPCB will provide individuals with commercially reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices.
					</li>
					<li>ONWARD TRANSFERS TO AGENTS. MPCB will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard Personal Information through measures consistent with this Privacy Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, the agent registering to participate in the Safe Harbor mechanism, or another method of assurance deemed adequate by the European Commission. Where MPCB has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Policy, MPCB will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the unauthorized use or disclosure.
					</li>
					<li>SECURITY. MPCB will take commercially reasonable steps to protect Personal Information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
					</li>
					<li>DATA INTEGRITY. MPCB will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. MPCB will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current to the extent appropriate for its intended use.
					</li>
					<li>ACCESS. Upon request, MPCB will grant individuals commercially reasonable access to Personal Information that it holds about them. In addition, MPCB will take commercially reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.
					</li>
					<li>ENFORCEMENT. MPCB will conduct compliance audits of its practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy. Any employee that MPCB determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
					</li>
