The inclusion of any link does not imply MyPhotoAlbum's endorsement of any other company, its websites, or its products and/or services. These linked websites have separate and independent privacy policies, which we recommend you read carefully. We have no control over such websites and therefore have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose and otherwise treat your personal information.

<br><br>
<strong class="large" style="font-weight:bold;">Security of Personal Information </strong>
<ul>
We will maintain the confidentiality of all personal information collected in our Store, our Sites and from our Service Providers and will only disclose such information to employees and Service Providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Privacy and Security Statement. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control. 
</ul>


<br><br>
<strong class="large" style="font-weight:bold;">Security Measures on Our Sites </strong>
<ul><br><br>
<strong>Secure Shopping:</strong> When you place orders on our Sites, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Sites from capturing and viewing your personal information. 
<br><br>
MyPhotoAlbum also takes the following measures to protect your personal information online: 
<br><br>
<strong>Passwords</strong>: To provide you with an increased level of security, online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. MyPhotoAlbum will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages). Order Information: Since any order information you provide to us on our Sites will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Sites. The most recent versions of Netscape NavigatorTM, FireFox and Microsoft Internet Explorerï¿½ can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Netscape and Microsoft website respectively. 
<br><br>
No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, MyPhotoAlbum cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us on our Sites.
