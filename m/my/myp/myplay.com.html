</p><p>Myplay wants to make your online experience safe and satisfying. This Privacy Policy, which will be updated as necessary at this page, explains how we do this. Our data-collection policies allow you to control how much information you give us, as well as how we use that information. Most importantly, we allow you to update and/or change the information that we have collected.
</p><p>You can do a lot to protect your own privacy.  Please remember that any information that is disclosed on the Browse Playlists page, such as your DJ name or the name of a shared or posted playlist, becomes public information.  Use caution and good judgment when disclosing personal information about yourself.
</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that this site contains links to other sites. While we will endeavor to work with partners who follow our privacy philosophy, myplay is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other Web sites.
</p><p><br>
<font color="#ff6600"><a name="coll"><b>What we collect, and why</b></a></font><img src="../gifs/clr.gif" width="20" height="1"><a href="#top"><img src="../gifs/arr_top.gif" width="42" height="14" hspace="5" border="0"></a>
</p><p>Myplay collects both "personal information" and "aggregate information" from our users. Personal information is user-specific and includes information collected on the Registration page: your name, e-mail address, and password.  This information is used to identify you as a registered user and protect the contents of your Locker. As myplay allows you to organize and listen to your music collection, we may also track your music choices and preferences based on the contents of your Locker. This information may be used to provide you with special information and promotional offers according to your specific tastes. In addition, we collect so-called "third-party personally identifiable information," such as the e-mail addresses of people who have been invited by you to listen to a playlist. Rest assured that we will never disclose your personal information, or that of an e-mail recipient, to third parties without your prior approval unless required by law. Moreover, if you authorize us to share personal information such as your e-mail address with our partners, you will always have the ability to "opt out" of receiving solicitations or other communications from those partners or myplay. To opt out, simply go to the Account Info page and change your preferences.
</p><p>Myplay also collects aggregate information, which is a generalized accumulation of data derived from users of our service.  Examples might include the number of users who requested a certain song.  This generalized data will not contain personal information about you.  We use this data to improve the user's experience on our Web site, and we share it with our partners to help all of us identify the interests and needs of those we serve.
</p><p>There is certain personal information myplay will require in order to process your request to open a Locker.  We will ask you for your e-mail address and password, for example, to confirm you as a registered user and to send you information about changes in service offered at myplay and our partners' sites.  At other times we may request additional personal information which you will have the option to furnish.  For example, we may also ask you questions about  your interests, favorite bands and hobbies in order to create a user profile for you and allow us to send you information that may be of interest to you.  Keep in mind, however, that if you choose not to share requested information with us, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services that are dependent upon the collection of such information.
</p><p>A word about "cookies:" To activate the features available at myplay, we will assign to your Internet browser (be it Netscape Navigator(tm) or Microsoft Internet Explorer(tm)) a unique ID number stored in a file on your computer. This file is called a cookie. Cookies are required to use myplay.
</p><p>Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Instead, a cookie introduces your browser to our computers. When you visit myplay, the cookie shakes hands, if you will, with our computer and says "Hi there, I'm #627. Remember me?" We do, which is how your personalized data--such as saved passwords and the contents of your Locker - is generated for you and you alone.
</p><p>Other parts of our site that use cookies are the advertisements. We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company and we do not have access to this information. Some of the customer data garnered from these cookies is shared with the advertising companies on an aggregate basis only.
</p><p>For more information about cookies, Netscape users should visit <a href="http://home.netscape.com/security/basics/privacy.html#cookies">http://home.netscape.com/security/basics/privacy.html#cookies</a>, and Microsoft users should visit <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/INSIDER/internet/articles/security.htm#cookies">http://www.microsoft.com/INSIDER/internet/articles/security.htm#cookies</a>.
</p><p>Finally, we also use your Internet Protocol address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Some aggregate information is gathered in this process, but never personal information.

</p><p>Myplay provides users the opportunity on the Registration Page to control the content and frequency of communications from us and certain of our partners. To do this, go to our <a href="http://www.myplay.com/mp/utils/account_info.jsp">Account Info</a> page, check or uncheck as many of the 'Subscribe' boxes as you wish, set the frequency of the e-mails you have selected, type in your password to authenticate the changes, and then click "Submit." We also permit users to close their account or to discontinue our service. To close your account, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:CustomerCare@myplay.com">CustomerCare@myplay.com</a> (be sure to send it from the e-mail address associated with your Locker, and please tell us why so that we can improve our service).
</p><p>If at some point in the future there is a change to our information usage practices that affect your personal information, we will notify you by e-mail of the relevant changes.  At the time of this message, you will be able to opt-out of this information usage by changing your preferences on the Account Info page as described above. You should also check this posted privacy statement for changes.
</p><p>If you would like to continue to use our service but need to update your e-mail address or wish to change any of your personal information for any reason, click the Account Info link at the top of your Locker page.

</p><p>Myplay assures security in three ways. 1. Our data network is protected by industry-standard firewall systems. Internal security reviews are made on a regular basis, and third-party audits are conducted to further ensure data confidentiality. 2. Only authorized myplay personnel have access to the data network, which is accessible by password only. 3. Last but not least, myplay employees are regularly updated about our security policies and practices so that all employees share a commitment to customer privacy.
