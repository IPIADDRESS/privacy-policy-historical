    <h3 align="center">PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

    <p>Last Updated: March 18, 2013</p>

    <p>FBPostMagic.com and Autom8tion Services, LLC. strives to offer its visitors   the many advantages of  Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized   experience.  We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail   address,  street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy   policy.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p>

    <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are   visiting,  the activities in which you elect to participate and the services   provided. For  example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for   access to  certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as   newsletters, free info products or  when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you   participate in  sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other   interactive  areas of our site. Like most Web sites, FBPostMagic.com (Or other replicated sites like this site) and Autom8tion Systems, LLC. also collects  information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that   may be  transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your   Internet  Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold   information  from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name   and  password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time   you  visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular  advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional   technology, we may  also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can   choose  not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser   to  refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access   certain  portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and   password,  and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according to   your  preferences.</p>

    <p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>

    <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your   visit and  deliver more individualized content and advertising. Contact information   may be  shared between Autom8tion Systems, LLC. and registered affiliates of   Autom8tion Systems, LLC.  and FBPostMagic.com.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify   you)  may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about   your  usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to   help  enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited   most or  what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may   occasionally be  shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this   information does  not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow   anyone to  identify you individually.</p>

    <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on  FBPostMagic.com  (Or other replicated sites like this site) to communicate with you about your registration and  customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy;   services and  products offered by FBPostMagic.com  (Or other replicated sites like this site) and other topics we think you might  find of interest.</p>

    <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by Kimball L. Roundy   inc. and FBPostMagic.com  (Or other replicated sites like this site) may  also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site  administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,  administration of sweepstakes and contests, offers, and other   communications with you.  Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of   our  site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information.   We will  use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to   time as  we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner   with  other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information   may be  among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in   response  to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably   required to  do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe   to us,  and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or  necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to   disclosure in  such cases.</p>

    <p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p>

    <p>Autom8tion Systems, LLC. and FBPostMagic.com expects its  partners, advertisers and affiliates to  respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third  parties,  including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content  providers  accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data  collection  policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you  may link  to, or view as part of a frame on a Autom8tion Systems, LLC. or  FBPostMagic.com (Or other replicated sites like this site) page, certain content  that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through  Autom8tion Systems, LLC. and FBPostMagic.com (Or other replicated sites like this site) you may be  introduced to, or be able to access,  information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by  other  parties. Autom8tion Systems, LLC. and FBPostMagic.com (Or other replicated sites like this site) is not  responsible for the actions or policies  of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies  of those  third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated  by a  third party.</p>

    <p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other  third  parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some  of your  preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our  advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that  enable the  advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular  advertisement before.  Other features available on our site may offer services operated by  third  parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.  Autom8tion Systems, LLC. and FBPostMagic.com (Or other replicated sites like this site) does not  control the use of this technology by third  parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any  actions or  policies of such third parties.</p>

    <p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally  Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that   information  can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties   without  our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other   individuals or  third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Autom8tion Systems, LLC. and FBPostMagic.com   and this policy.</p>
