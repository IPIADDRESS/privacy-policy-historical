<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

<p>Like most websites, <em>Punchbowl Software</em> uses "cookies" to allow you to bypass the login screen ("Remember Me" functionality). A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer and allows <em>Punchbowl Software</em> to recognize you as a member when you return to <strong>MyPunchbowl</strong> from the same computer and browser.

<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, when you register with <strong>MyPunchbowl</strong>, a cookie helps <em>Punchbowl Software</em> to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.

<h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>

<p><em>Punchbowl Software</em> secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. <em>Punchbowl Software</em> secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p><em>Punchbowl Software</em> will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. The effective date will be posted at the top of this agreement if any changes are made to the agreement.</p>

<h2>Contact Information</h2>
