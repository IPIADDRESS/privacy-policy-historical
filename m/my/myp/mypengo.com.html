<br><br><br>COOKIES
<br><br>We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

<br><br>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized. 

<br><br>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other web sites you visit.

We do not control such other web- and wapsites and are not responsible or liable for the availability thereof or the content, advertising, products or other materials contained on such sites. We shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss incurred or suffered by any user in connection therewith. Your access and use of linked sites, including the content therein, is solely at your own risk.

<br><br>If you do not want to receive promotional information, e-mails or other mail from us or our partners, please info@mypengo.com.

<br><br>You can remove personal information that you have provided to us.  Deleting your information will delete the data only in our database for purposes of managing future communications from us and third parties. These deletions will not delete information already collected that may have already been shared with third parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Statement. You will need to contact third parties that may contact you directly to delete your personal information that they may be using to contact you.


<br><br><br>SECURITY
<br><br>Protecting your information is important to us. We use the industry standard technology to protect the security of your information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and via mobile communications networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we are committed to protecting your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or through us.
