Privacy Statement</h1><p><br></p><h3>MYOB values your privacy</h3><p>MYOB considers 
the guarding of your privacy as of the utmost importance. This <b>MYOB Limited 
Group Privacy Statement</b> states our commitment to maintaining your privacy.</p><h3>Reasons 
for collecting information</h3><p>MYOB only collects such information as is necessary 
to conduct business with you. You will always know what information is being collected, 
and will have the option to choose how MYOB utilises your information to communicate 
with you. We will only collect information by lawful and fair means and not in 
an intrusive way. </p><p>MYOB and its service providers will only use personal 
or business information you have supplied in order to: </p><ul><li>identify you 
as the product owner and to provide better customer service to you, your business 
partners and your employees;</li><li>perform authorised financial transactions 
with you and your associated service providers;</li><li>operate our business as 
it pertains to you;</li><li>keep you informed about MYOB products and services 
and those of relevant business partners; and</li><li>fulfil legal and regulatory 
obligations.</li></ul><p>Aggregated data that contains no information specific 
to a particular person or business may be shared with our business partners, for 
example, aggregated statistical trend in a particular industry sector.</p><h3>How 
we use your information</h3><p>MYOB uses the information you supply in many ways 
necessary for us to do business together: product promotion, order fulfilment, 
product registration and company file activation, provide transactional services 
and customer support and for secure access to MYOB websites.</p><p><strong>Product 
promotion</strong></p><p>MYOB needs to be able to contact you about product upgrades 
and new product releases and to inform you of new services relevant to your business, 
including special offers (you may, however, notify us at any time that you do 
not want to receive any marketing communications from MYOB)</p><p><strong>Order 
fulfilment</strong></p><p>When ordering products and services, you must provide 
contact information (such as name and delivery address) and financial information 
(such as credit-card number and expiration date if you are using this payment 
method). MYOB uses this information to fulfil your order and bill you. If we have 
trouble processing an order, this contact information is also used to get in touch 
with you to resolve the problem.</p><p><strong>Product registration</strong></p><p>MYOB 
asks you to register each product or service you purchase with relevant personal 
and business details. Registration ensures that only you - and no unauthorised 
persons - receive upgrades and special offers.</p><p><strong>Company File Activation</strong></p><p>MYOB 
asks you to activate each of the company files you create. During Activation two 
sets of numbers, the product serial number and a number generated by the product 
at activation, are sent via secure Internet connection to MYOB. A final number 
is sent back to your computer to automatically activate the company file. Activation 
is completed either directly via the internet or by dialing into an automated 
activation system using a touchtone phone. The same process applies to periodic 
company file confirmations.</p><p><strong>Transactional Services</strong></p><p>To 
facilitate the provision of the transactional service for which you have applied 
MYOB is required to pass information you have provided to its service providers.</p><p><strong>Customer 
support</strong></p><p>Registration links your MYOB product and version to your 
contact details. This allows our support consultants to provide you with quality 
advice relevant to your particular situation when you call MYOB Customer support. 
If software or documentation needs to be emailed or posted to you, the consultant 
has all the information needed to ensure fast service.</p><p><strong>MYOB website 
access</strong></p><p>Many useful services are currently available at MYOB websites 
and more services are being planned. Your information gives you authorised access 
so that you - and only you - can update your personal information, access online 
help or perform financial transactions. <br>Our web sites may contain links to 
other sites belonging to other parties and which are beyond the control of MYOB. 
Please note that we cannot vouch or be responsible for the privacy practices of 
non-MYOB sites.</p><h3><a name="sec"></a>Securing electronic communication</h3><p>Personal information 
that is submitted to MYOB websites it is protected both on- and offline.<br>MYOB 
web pages that request information or allow transaction processing use the Hypertext 
Transport Protocol Security (HTTPS) protocol (excluding Test Drive and Accountant 
updates) which allows data to be transmitted in an encrypted form known as Secure 
Sockets Layer® (SSL) - visit <a href="http://www.ssl.com" target="_blank">http://www.ssl.com</a> 
for details. <br>You can confirm that any MYOB data-entry page is secure by checking 
that</p><ul><li>the page address in the Web browser's tool bar or status bar begins 
with https://, or</li><li>the padlock icon in the web browser's tool bar or status 
bar is locked.</li></ul><p>MYOB is also committed to protecting your information 
offline. All of your personal and business information, not just sensitive information, 
is restricted to only those employees who need it to perform a specific task. 
For example, an accounts clerk may need access to your bank details to remit a 
credit-card overpayment or a customer service representative may need to identify 
you to inform you of a free upgrade.<br>MYOB also uses Internet Protocol (IP) 
addresses to analyse trends, administer our websites, track your navigation among 
MYOB web pages and gather broad information for aggregate use. Our web servers 
may also send cookies to your browser to track navigation history and ensure transaction 
pages, such as 'shopping cart' interactions, work correctly. Cookies contain only 
coded information that cannot be used by third parties to access your confidential 
information.</p><h3>Accountability and legislative compliance </h3><p>The MYOB 
Group informs its employees about the importance of confidentiality and customer 
privacy through its operating procedures, training programs and internal policies. 
MYOB will take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce privacy responsibilities 
of its employees. <br>If MYOB contracts with external service providers to provide 
service support, MYOB will require them to conform to the MYOB Group privacy policy.</p><ul><li>The 
MYOB Limited Group Privacy Statement has been developed in accordance with relevant 
local and international privacy legislation.</li></ul><p>To demonstrate that our 
privacy policy accords with this privacy legislation, we are committed to a voluntary 
self-assessment procedure and, in some countries, subject to supervision and inspection 
by appropriate government agencies.</p><h3>Correction of problems</h3><p>If you 
have any questions or you believe that MYOB has not adhered to this Privacy Statement, 
please contact the Privacy Officer in your local MYOB office. We will then use 
all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine if there is a problem 
and take the necessary corrective action.<br>In the event that you need to update 
or correct your personal or business information, you can do so at <a href="http://my.myob.com.au" target="_blank">http://my.myob.com.au</a> 
Alternatively, you can call, fax or mail changes to your personal information 
to your local MYOB office.</p><h3>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h3><p>Any 
changes to this Privacy Statement that may be made from time to time will be available 
on the MYOB website. You can also obtain a copy of the current Privacy Statement 
by either emailing or writing to the privacy officer in your local MYOB office.</p><h3>Contacting
