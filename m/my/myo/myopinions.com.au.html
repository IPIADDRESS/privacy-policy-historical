Registration with, use of, and access to MO's Services is subject to MO's <a href="/terms.aspx">Terms and Conditions</a>. Your use of MO's Services is completely voluntary and therefore MO's processing of your PII in connection with the Services and this Privacy Policy is with your consent. MO strives to conform its privacy practices to applicable laws, codes, and regulations, and the codes of standards of applicable market and opinion survey research associations, including, without limitation, ASMOR,. For clarification, except for Panels that have a separate privacy policy, this Privacy Policy applies to all of MO's survey research panels, including, without limitation,  MyOpinions (each a "<strong>Panel</strong>" and collectively the "<strong>Panels</strong>"). All references in this Privacy Policy to MO include MO and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies. All references to "us" or "we" refer to MO. </p>
                <p>All PII is currently stored on servers located in Australia.  However, we may without further notice to you, elect to store such PII on servers located in the United States, ("<strong>US</strong>") - In the event we elect to do so, we agree that we will comply with the European Union ("<strong>EU</strong>") and US - Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from EU member countries and Switzerland. </p>
                <p>For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, the term "<strong>PII</strong>" shall include, without limitation, your name, address(es), telephone number(s) (including home, cell, and/or business telephone numbers), email address(es), date of birth, the unique identification number we assign to you (individually a "<strong>UID</strong>" and collectively "<strong>UIDs</strong>"), reward, loyalty, or incentive account numbers, and Sensitive Data (as defined herein).</p>

                <p>MO collects information from Panel members during and after registration with a Panel, including, without limitation, during participation in a survey and in connection with the receipt and redemption of rewards and incentives.

"Sensitive Data" means PII that discloses or reveals health and medical conditions, sexual orientation or sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership. Sensitive Data is used to target survey opportunities to you. By way of clarification, by voluntarily disclosing Sensitive Data to MO you expressly consent to the transfer of Sensitive Data by MO to the United States for storage and processing. </p>

                <p><i>MO's Use of Cookies Generally.</i></p>
                <p>Cookies are small files that store certain data on a device or computer. MO may use session and persistent cookies for several purposes including, without limitation, to provide a better survey experience, quality control, validation, to enable or facilitate survey participation, tracking of completed surveys or other completed actions, and for fraud detection and/or prevention. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device or computer indefinitely until deleted.</p> 
                
                <p><i>Use of Cookies by Subcontractors Generally.</i></p>
                <p>MO uses third parties to provide services and certain functionality to MO, including, without limitation, fraud detection services. MO uses contracts with such third parties to control their use of cookies and to limit their use of cookies to the limited purposes set forth in the contracts.  </p>  
                
                <p><i>MO's Online Ad Effectiveness Program.</i></p>
                
                <p>In connection with MO's online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that MO is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, MO's clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a "<strong>Third Party Technology</strong>" and collectively the "<strong>Third Party Technologies</strong>"). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, MO's servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and MO's client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, MO's client will send your UID and the specific survey to MO and MO will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey. Additionally, if you participate, MO may share your UID and data previously collected by MO, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, ("<strong>Audience Measurement Data</strong>"), to third parties, including, without limitation, MO's subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents).  </p>   
                
                <p><strong>If you live outside of the EU and you have not previously agreed to participate in the Online Ad Effectiveness Program, as of the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to participate.

                <h2>Does MO collect data from children? </h2>
                <p>MO believes it is important to protect the online privacy of children. Accordingly, MO adheres to Applicable Laws and Codes pertaining to the protection of children's privacy, including, without limitation, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 in the United States (as amended). MO carefully considers both privacy issues and parental concerns in connection with surveys involving individuals under the age of eighteen (18). Certain countries where MO operates and maintains a Panel may prescribe an age threshold under which parental consent is required for the collection of PII. MO's Services are not designed or intended for use by any individual under such age thresholds. MO does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under such age thresholds. If MO became aware that it had inadvertently collected PII from anyone under such age thresholds, MO would promptly delete such PII. For example, in the United States, MO's Services are not designed or intended for use by any individual under the age of thirteen (13) and MO does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of thirteen (13). </p>
                <p>Parents, guardians or other persons with parental rights are encouraged to contact MO, as set forth below, to discuss this Privacy Policy and their rights to access, review, correct, delete or object to the processing of PII of or about their child or children. </p>

                <p>MO maintains appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect PII and other information disclosed or collected by MO. MO reviews, monitors and evaluates its privacy practices and protection systems on a regular basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, transmissions over the Internet and/or a mobile network are not one hundred percent (100%) secure and MO does not guarantee the security of transmissions. MO is not responsible for any errors by individuals in submitting PII to MO. </p>
