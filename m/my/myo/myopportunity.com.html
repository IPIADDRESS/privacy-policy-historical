            <p>Your privacy is our top concern. We work hard to earn and keep your trust, so we adhere to the
                following principles to protect your privacy:</p>

            <p>Any sensitive information that you provide will be secured with all industry standard protocols
                and technology</p>

            <p>Notice of all changes that materially affect ways in which your personally identifiable data may
                be used or shared will be posted in updates to our Privacy Policy. If you continue to use
                Opportunity after notice of changes have been sent to you or published on our site, you hereby
                provide your consent to the changed practices.</p>

            <p>Please read this privacy policy to learn more about:
                </p><ol>
                    <li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected by Opportunity</li>
                    <li>How the information is used.</li>
                    <li>With whom the information may be shared.</li>
                    <li>How you can access and change your Account information.</li>
                    <li>What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of
                        information collected by Opportunity.</li>
                    <li>How to contact us.</li>
                </ol>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Information Collection</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Registration:
                </dt><dd>In order to become an Opportunity user, you must first create an account on this web site. To
                    create an account you are required to login using your existing LinkedIn account. Without a
                    LinkedIn account, you will not be able to create an Opportunity profile. Once logged in, Opportunity
                    (in compliance with LinkedIn's API Terms of Service) will capture your name, email address, country,
                    region (Metro Area), and current company name. Opportunity will also request that you manually provide
                    a brief summary of your company (i.e. a 'pitch'), and a few ways to describe yourself and/or your
                    business (industry types, skill sets, and more).</dd>

                <dt>Profile Information:
                </dt><dd>Once a user, you may provide additional information to your account including various ways people may
                    contact you including phone, Google+, Skype and more.. Providing additional information beyond what is
                    required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better promote your business and find
                    new opportunities within Opportunity.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h3>Information about your Contacts</h3>
            <p>In order to invite others to connect with you directly on Opportunity, you will enter their names and email
                addresses (we also provide a contact upload form for bulk invites). This information will be used by
                Opportunity to send your invitation to connect on Opportunity.</p>

            <p>You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contact. . All information entered will
                only be viewable by you and will not be searchable by others in the Opportunity network without your
                permission.</p>

            <p>All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this
                privacy policy as cover your own personally identifiable information.</p>

            <h3>Cookies &amp; Log Files</h3>
            <p>Like most web sites, Opportunity uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data
                file which resides on your computer which allows Opportunity to recognize you as a user when you return to
                our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow
                cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in
                your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.</p>

            <p>One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you've logged in to your
                Opportunity account. The next time you visit the Opportunity web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to
                recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in (using LinkedIn OAuth) before using the
                service. In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number), however,
                you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.
                Additionally, if you log out of the Opportunity site you will need to re-enter your LinkedIn login
                credentials the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a
                “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Opportunity site. Session
                cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>

            <p>Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Opportunity web site we automatically
                receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave
                Opportunity. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you
                use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using,
                as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the
                Opportunity service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is
                never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.</p>

            <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
            <p>We may allow other companies (although not presently), called ad networks, to serve advertisements to
                Opportunity users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and
                research firms. Opportunity may “target” some ads to users that fit a certain general profile -
                for example, “web designers looking for accountants in Tampa, FL.” These ads may also be
                promoted within emails sent to each user.</p>

            <p>To deliver these ads properly, Opportunity may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks
                within pages served by Opportunity so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research
                and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.</p>

            <p>Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers,
                these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from
                their site.</p>

            <p>These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a
                substitute for random, irrelevant ads. You will never see additional ads as a result of being an
                Opportunity user and Opportunity never provides personally identifiable information to any advertiser
                nor any third party.</p>

            <h3>Children</h3>
            <p>Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit
                any personal information to us or use the service.</p>

            <h3>Information Use</h3>
            <p>Opportunity is a lead generation tool designed to bring professionals together in a more intelligent way.
                The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe
                yourself and your company to others. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an
                individual, is collected by Opportunity, Inc. from the site (such as, by way of example, patterns of
                utilization) and is exclusively owned by Opportunity. This information can be utilized by Opportunity
                at its sole discretion.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity Communications</h3>
            <p>Opportunity may communicate with you through email, direct mail, telephone, mobile phone, IM and fax.
                These may include a series of promotional and informative emails regarding new features and services
                provided by Opportunity as well as notifications to alert you of new business opportunities with other
                members. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from Opportunity related to the
                proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when another user requests to connect with
                you. Opportunity may send you promotional information at any time.</p>

            <h3>Customized Content</h3>
            <p>Information you provide at registration or in your Profile section is also used to customize your
                experience on the web site. For example, when you login to your account we may partial information
                about you and your company on our homepage when people log-in. The intent (obviously) is to provide
                you with immediate and maximum exposure opportunities.</p>

            <p>Additionally, many users upload third-party logos to their profiles. Opportunity neither endorses nor
                is affiliated with most of these third-party companies. In most cases, Opportunity is not affiliated
                with these companies. If a company feels the logo placed on a profile is in violation of their
                trademark guidelines, they should contact the profile owner and/or contact Opportunity directly to
                have the logo removed.</p>


            <h3>Sharing Information With Third Parties</h3>
            <p>Opportunity takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will only share your personally
                identifiable with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services.
                For instance, we use a credit card processing company to bill users for subscription fees. These
                third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to
                provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use
                of such information.</p>

            <p>Opportunity offers a “public profile” as well as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) features
                which publish portions of user's profiles, including “name” and “company name”,
                to the public Internet.</p>

            <p>Opportunity will also share portions of your contact information with other members who we have
                determined to be a good match. The spirit of our website is to connect people more intelligently
                and efficiently. Simply put, if you do not wish to have your contact information shared with other
                users, you should not sign-up for Opportunity.</p>

            <p>We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as
                we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We may segment our users by role (i.e. product
                managers, vice presidents), industry, geographic location, company. If you would like to be excluded
                from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users' activities on
                the site, please email customer service.</p>

            <h3>Partnering with Other Organizations to Offer Combined Services</h3>
            <p>Opportunity may partner with other online services to give you the combined results of both services.
                Whenever we offer such combined services it will be your choice to make use of the combined services
                or not.</p>

            <h3>Communications Between Users</h3>
            <p>Many emails you initiate through Opportunity an invitation sent to a non-user for instance, will list
                your name in the header of the message. Emails you initiate may also provide aggregate information
                about you and your company. Other communications that you initiate through Opportunity, like a request
                for contact, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact
                information. However, your contact information will be shared with another user if both of you have
                been determined by Opportunity to be a “match”. At which time, an email alert will be sent
                originating from Opportunity containing various ways in which the user can communicate with you
                including email, phone, Skype and more.</p>

            <p>Opportunity provides the User with a platform on which to establish contact with other users, and only
                provides those technical applications that allow users to contact one another. With regards to content,
                Opportunity does not take part in any communication between users. If users enter into agreements with
                one another over the Opportunity website, Opportunity shall not be a contracting party to these
                agreements. The users alone are responsible for the execution and/or fulfillment of agreements in
                which they enter with one another. Opportunity shall not be held liable if users are unable to contact
                one another over Opportunity websites regarding such agreements. Furthermore, Opportunity shall not be
                liable for breaches of duty in relation to agreements entered into between users.</p>

            <h3>Point and Rating System</h3>
            <p>Opportunity uses a verification / rating system (both public and private) to understand our users AND
                provide the overall community with an understanding of the quality of the users on the network. You
                may be awarded credits/badges based upon your status within the system (Premium Member, etc ...) and/or
                your use of the system. Opportunity may adjust your credit balance or rating, change system credit
                values or modify the credit and rating system at any time at its discretion. Credits have no monetary
                value and are not redeemable.</p>

            <h3>Legal Disclaimer:</h3>
            <p>It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose
                such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order,
                ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal
                rights or defend against legal claims.</p>

            <h3>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information</h3>
            <p>You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information,
                or to the settings for your Opportunity account, at any time by editing the information on your Profile
                page. You can also close your account through the Opportunity website. If you close your Opportunity
                account, We may retain certain data contributed by you if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or
                future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated,
                non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained data will
                continue to be subject to the terms of the Opportunity Privacy Policy that you have previously agreed
                to. To request that we close your account and remove your information from the Opportunity service,
                please send your request to info[at]Opportunity.com. Please send your request using an email account
                that you have registered with Opportunity under your name. You will receive a response to requests
                sent to info[at]Opportunity.com usually within a few days of the receipt of the email.</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>In order to secure your personal information, access to your data (including credit card information)
                on Opportunity is password-protected. At the present time, we do not have access to any detailed credit
                card information (unless provided directly over the telephone or at one of our events), as that is
                hosted entirely through our third party merchant service provider.</p>

            <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>Opportunity may update this privacy policy. In the event there are significant changes in the way we
                treat your personally identifiable information, we will display a notice on this site. Unless stated
                otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your
                account.</p>

            <h3>Questions or Comments</h3>
            <p>If you have questions or comments about this privacy policy, please email us at
