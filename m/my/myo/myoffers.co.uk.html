					<a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b><br><br>
					 
					MyOffers takes your privacy seriously and takes every reasonable precaution to safeguard the personal information you supply to it<br><br>

					MyOffers recognizes that your privacy and the protection of your personal information is important to you, this statement discloses how MyOffers helps to protect your personal information while using the MyOffers Web Site (<a href="http://www.myoffers.co.uk">http://www.myoffers.co.uk</a>).<br><br>

					MyOffers is registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 under registration number Z4685005. The information you provide is safeguarded under the terms of that Act. To find out more information about the data protection act please visit <a href="http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk">http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk</a><br><br>
					  
					<a name="cpi"></a><b>MyOffers collection of your personal information </b><br><br>
					 
					MyOffers collects demographic (information about you, such as name, age and address) and lifestyle (information about your interests and purchasing habits).

					<a name="dpi"></a><b>MyOffers general disclosure of personal information</b><br><br>

					The collection of data by MyOffers through registration on third party sites may lead to your data also being held by that third party site.<br><br>

					The data that you provide to MyOffers, is held by both MyOffers and the sponsors, of the questionnaires that you answer.

					MyOffers may from time to time use third party suppliers to provide all or part of a service to you. MyOffers shall only be entitled to supply such of your personal information as is necessary to enable them to provide the relevant service to you.<br><br>

					You should be aware that such outside service providers might be based in countries outside the European Union whose laws provide for a different standard of protection for your personal data than that provided under English law.

					Except as provided above, MyOffers will not provide your personal information to any third party without your prior consent, however, under certain circumstances the force of law may require the provision of information to the legal authorities.
