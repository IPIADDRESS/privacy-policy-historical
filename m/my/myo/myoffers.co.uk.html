            <p>Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better 
            manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, 
            similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are 
            stored on a user's device hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We do not tie the information gathered 
            by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
            <h4>Use of Performance Cookies</h4>
            <p>MyOffers uses website performance cookies (via Google Analytics; click <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/privacyoverview.html" class="primary-link">here</a> 
            to review their Privacy Policy) to analyse traffic information such as the pages you visit, the time you spend on the site. 
            These cookies are anonymous and we do not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. The information collected 
            using these cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>
            <p>MyOffers also uses tracking pixels to measure visits to the site from one particular source (e.g. a specific banner or 
            email campaign) and the response rates from these sources. These tracking pixels will not collect your browsing history and 
            are used for website and traffic source performance purposes only.</p>
            <p>We use these services in order to increase the efficiency of our websites.</p>
            <h4>Non MyOffers Cookies</h4>
            <p>MyOffers and some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) place cookies via our site. We have no access to or control 
            over these cookies.</p>
            <p>These cookies are used to share your audience segments with third parties (advertisers, publishers or social networks) 
            to make adverts more relevant to you. Audience segments are a pool of users that have been grouped together based upon previous 
            web browsing behaviour and lifestyle and demographic profiles. By allowing these cookies, you are more likely to get relevant 
            adverts while you visit other sites. Preventing these cookies will not stop adverts but they will be less tailored to your 
            interests. Although these cookies can be used to identify the audience segment you belong to, they will neither contain nor 
            collect any personal identifiable information.</p>
