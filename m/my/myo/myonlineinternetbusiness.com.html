<h1 align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">PRIVACY POLICY</font></h1>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Your privacy is very important to us. We want to 
make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and 
we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and 
opportunities with complete confidence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We have created this Privacy Policy to 
demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy 
describes how our company collects information from all end users of our 
Internet services (the "Services")-those who access some of our Services but do 
not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or 
pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what we do 
with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have 
concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that you read 
this Privacy Policy carefully.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Personal Information Our Company Collects and 
How It Is Used</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Introduction. Our company collects information in 
different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our 
Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use 
this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our 
Products and Services, and generally, do not share this information with third 
parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have 
received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as 
when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases 
described below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Registration: Members may be asked to provide 
certain personal information when they sign up for our Products or Services 
including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit 
card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the 
Services. The personal information collected from Members during the 
registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for 
billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless 
specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, in instances where our company and a 
partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the partner certain 
personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who 
subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole 
purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In this instance, personal information may not be 
used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying 
and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during 
registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As 
explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying 
information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products 
and services may be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an 
affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide 
Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need 
to collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, you will be 
notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to 
use that particular service or feature.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Additionally, our partners may have 
advertisements or co-branded Web Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, 
independent contractor seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share 
non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not 
personal information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded 
products or services offered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can 
purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a 
newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may 
be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email 
address, phone number, and credit/debit card information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you complete an order for someone else, such 
as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to 
provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, 
and phone number. Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any 
personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise 
care when doing so.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you order services or products directly from 
our company we will use the personal information you provide only to process 
that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the 
extent necessary to complete that order.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Online Advertisements: Our company may display 
our online advertisements. In those cases we share aggregated and 
non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the 
registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these 
advertisers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Additionally, in some instances, we use this 
aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements or 
joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us 
the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the 
audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have 
collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended 
audience. Our company does not share personal information about its Visitors or 
Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or 
Members send email inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to 
answer the email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return email 
address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with 
any third party.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically 
conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our 
customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important 
information that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer 
and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will 
remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. 
Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We may take the information we receive from 
individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it 
with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic 
responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, 
education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We 
then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to 
you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally 
identifying information may be shared with third parties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Promotions: Our company may offer polls, 
contests, sweepstakes, drawings, games, content, or other promotions that are 
sponsored by or cobranded with third parties. In certain instances, company may 
have to supply personally identifiable information of the winners to the third 
parties. Our company has no control over third parties' use of this information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or 
other promotion, simply by making a purchase from us or by providing us with 
personally identifiable information for some other reason or purpose. When the 
winning entries are chosen, only the names and personally identifiable 
information of the winners are shared with the entity administering the 
sweepstakes or contest, so that they can notify the winners.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Special Cases: It is our company's policy not to 
use or share the personal information about Visitors of Members in ways 
unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity 
to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, we may disclose personal information 
about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or 
Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole 
discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit 
agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or 
to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child 
Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such 
information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or 
bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use 
Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services 
properly; or to protect our company and our Members.</font></p>
