				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Our Notice</strong></p>
<p>myON collects information about students’ reading performance. We gather only the minimum enrollment information provided by schools required to track that performance over time: student name, grade, teacher(s), and group(s). myON gathers that data from the school or district through a FERPA school official role. Schools and school districts get parental consent for limited student data to be stored in myON in order for students to have access to the myON platform. We do not collect or store any information about a student’s race, socio-economic status, social security number, street address, parent contact info, or email address. No financial transactions or financial account information is stored in any of the myON.com data tables. myON complies with US FERPA and COPPA legislation, as detailed in the myON license agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choice</strong></p>
<p>By using myON after reading this privacy policy, you give us permission to collect reading performance data through myON. We track what books every student opens, what books they finish, how much time they spend reading, and the results of the assessments they take – measures of reading ability (Lexile benchmarks) and reading comprehension (Book quizzes). We also store students’ rankings of interest categories (Animals, Inventions, Mythology, Graphic Novels…). We use this information to recommend books to students based on their grade, their interests, and their reading measure.</p>
<p>School enrollment data, reading progress statistics, the web application, and the book assets are all stored on separate and secure servers. The only way to access any of this data is through a secure and authenticated login. Logins of adults (school administrators and faculty) can access dashboards and reports of reading progress at the grade and group level for users within the building or district. Faculty can monitor reading progress by grade, group, and individual for students assigned to their roster. myON does not hold information that is part of a learner’s educational record. Again, no demographic data of any kind is stored about students except their name, grade, gender, and group assignment(s).</p>
<p><strong>User Supplied Information</strong></p>
<p>No students will ever be contacted regarding any service or opt-in marketing information. Supplying adults’ email addresses (school administrators and faculty) is entirely optional. Supplying an email guarantees that you will be notified of changes to the system, changes to the license agreement, privacy policy, or terms of use, and other myON professional development opportunities. We will never give your contact information to any other institution or email database for any marketing, sales, or solicitations. We hold your contact information on secure servers that can be accessed by only the highest levels of management.</p>
<p>We may disclose user information in extraordinary circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone where there is evidence that he or she is causing injury, shows intent to commit a crime, behaves or presents in a way that requires a teacher to act as first responder, or infringes upon myON rights or property, or other users of myON.com, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may use or disclose user information to address possible violations of the myON’s Terms of Use or if we believe in good faith that the law requires the disclosure.</p>
<p>myON may share statistics about large aggregations of users with strategic partners and educational researchers. For example, we may disclose that X% of myON’s audience is east of the Mississippi and Y% is west of the Mississippi River. Or, the Q% of a school’s reading time occurs within school hours and R% occurs before and after school. This data will never contain personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Your IP Address</strong></p>
<p>myON collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to generate aggregate information, and to audit the use of the Web site. When you request pages from the Web site, our servers log your IP address. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of use of the Web site or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

If you wish to access, remove or correct any personally identifying data you have supplied to myON, or if you would like to express a concern over changes to our license agreement, terms of use, or privacy policy, you may do so by (either/or):</p>

<p>Please understand that in order to protect your privacy and security, we may also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. </p>
<p><strong>Data Integrity</strong></p>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, myON has put in place strong security measures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Some schools and school districts using myON may also choose to use data integration services from myON partners. myON data integration partners offering rostering or single sign-on services adhere to the same data privacy policies as myON.</p>
