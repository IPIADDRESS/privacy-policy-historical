			<h3>
	Your Privacy &amp; Security</h3>
<p>
	As your privacy is important to us, Logitech has prepared this Statement of Privacy and Security (“Statement”) so that you may better understand how Logitech uses and protects the personal information on its website www.logitech.com (“Site”). Please take the time to review this page and contact us at privacy@logitech.com with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Logitech,-Inc/validation?rid=bef2dd75-99a2-4dcc-816a-e03643a9faee" target="_blank"><img alt="TRUSTe European Safe Harbor certification" src="http://privacy-policy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Logitech,-Inc/seal?rid=bef2dd75-99a2-4dcc-816a-e03643a9faee" style="border: none"></a></p>
<h3>
	Collection of Information</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Submission of Personal Information</strong><br>
	You may register at our Site and provide personal information, at such times as when you download software, register new products, access product information, features or programs, or sign into a page that requires authorization. This may include your name, email address, physical address, etc. You may also provide demographic information such as your age, education level, household income, and whether you are a personal or business user. You will know what you submit in each case, because you will manually enter the information. If you choose not to register and provide this information, you can still use most of the Site. Unfortunately, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Children's Personal Information</strong><br>
	We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have such personal information, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Automatic Collection of Information</strong><br>
	Logitech automatically collects on our server logs certain information about your computer hardware and software when you visit our Site. This information may include such things as your IP address, operating system, a description of any Logitech products connected and how such products are used, browser type, domain names, access times, service provider and referring website addresses.</p>
<p>
	Logitech and its third party service providers collect non-personal information about how you use our Site through cookies, Internet tags in the aggregate, and track navigational data. We also collect information such as the URL of the website you previously visited, the pages you visit within our Site and any transaction details (downloads, requests, etc.). You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse or delete cookies altogether, but certain features of our Site might not work.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Social Media Features</strong><br>
	Our Site includes social network sign-in services, the Facebook Like button, and widgets, including the Share button (collectively “Features”). These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site, and they allow you the ability to post information about your activities on this Site to your profile page to share with others within your network. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Purchase of Products</strong><br>
	Our shopping cart and checkout pages may have the look and feel of being on <a href="http://www.logitech.com" target="_blank">www.logitech.com</a>, however the information that you submit on these pages is collected by our payment processor and not collected by Logitech. Our payment processor is authorized to collect and use the submitted information only for the purposes of providing this service.</p>
<p>
	We recommend you read the privacy statement of our payment processor, viewable where your information is collected.</p>
<h3>

<p>
	If you submit personal information to any third party websites linked to or from our Site, your information is governed by their privacy statement. Logitech encourages you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Use of non-Personal Information</strong><br>
	We also use anonymous and aggregated data to create statistics and reports for various business purposes. We may aggregate anonymous data and share the anonymous data with our co-marketing partners in order to offer all our customers potentially desirable products and services as well as to improve our content and services.</p>
<p>
	<strong>E-mail Messaging</strong><br>
	Logitech will periodically send users e-mail messages about our products and services. We also use tracking pixels to determine, in the aggregate, how many people open our e-mails.</p>

		<p>
			Before we disclose your personally identifiable data for other reasons, we will first obtain your consent, for example via e-mail, click-through, an online opportunity to opt-out, or otherwise.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			If you post any information in public areas of our Site, such as forums or other areas, it will be available to the public and we may reuse and republish such information at our discretion and in accordance with our Terms of Use.</p>
