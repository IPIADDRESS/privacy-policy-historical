      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Access to Personal 
        Information</b><br>

        held about them and complies with the individual access principal of Schedule 
        1, Clause 4.9 of PIPEDA.</font></p>

        can access the myhosting.com web-based Control Panel that allows individuals 
        to view and update all of their Personal Information at any time. Pursuant 
        to Schedule 1, Clause 4.9.5 of PIPEDA, individuals may also request an

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Pursuant to Schedule

        delete an individual’s Personal Information from myhosting.com’s 
        system and records . However, due to technical constraints and the fact 
        that myhosting.com backs up its systems, Personal Information may continue 
        to reside in myhosting.com’s systems after deletion for some time. 
        Individuals, therefore, should not expect that their Personal Information 
        would be completely removed from myhosting.com’s systems in response 
        to an accepted request for deletion.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">myhosting.com reserves 
        the right to decline access to Personal Information where disclosure of

      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Where information 
        will not or cannot be disclosed, the individual making the request will 
        be provided with the reasons for non-disclosure, pursuant to the principal 
        in Schedule 1, Clause 4.9.4 of PIPEDA. Where information will be disclosed, 
        myhosting.com will endeavour to provide the information in question within 
        a reasonable time and no later than thirty (30) days following the request.

        not respond to repetitious or vexatious requests for access. In determining 
        whether a request is repetitious or vexatious, myhosting.com will consider

        for which the information is used, and the nature of the information.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To guard against 
        fraudulent requests for access, myhosting.com will require sufficient
