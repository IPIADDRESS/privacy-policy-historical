		<h3><a id="privacy1"></a>What kind of personal information does myhome.com.au collect and how</h3>
		<p>Myhome.com.au collects personal information from members of the public and other people it does business with (eg contact people in external service providers). If you use the myhome.com.au website you may be asked to provide personal information such as your name, addresss, contact details and gender.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, the personal information collected is generally limited to business contact information.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3><a id="privacy2"></a>How and why myhome.com.au collects personal information</h3>
		<p>Website users: if you use the myhome.com.au website, personal information will be collected directly from so that we can provide you with the services you have requested (eg so you can subscribe to our services or request some other service from myhome.com.au).</p>
		<p>We may also ask you to provide personal information if you complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition or an event, seek employment, or communicate with myhome.com.au by email, telephone, mail or in writing.</p>
		<p>Business contacts: Sometimes myhome.com.au needs to collect personal information from people we do business with. This will usually happen when we collect the name and business details of a real estate agent or its employees. We collect this information in order to carry out our business.</p>
		<p>myhome.com.au's policy is only to use personal information for the purpose for which it was collected (or related purposes that be reasonably expected).</p>
		<p>We won't use your personal information for any other purpose without your consent.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3><a id="privacy3"></a>Does myhome.com.au collect Sensitive Information?</h3>
		<p>"Sensitive Information" includes personal information relating to a person's health, race and ethnic origin (among other things). As a general rule, we don't need to collect 'sensitive information'. If we do need it for a specific purpose (eg to provide you with a service you have requested), we will seek your consent before we collect it.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3><a id="privacy4"></a>Will your personal information be given to anyone else?</h3>
		<p>If you volunteer personal information to a real estate agent through our website, it will be disclosed to that real estate agent (which will handle that personal information in accordance with its own privacy policy).</p>
		<p>Personal information collected by myhome.com.au may be disclosed to a related company of myhome.com.au or to the following types of third parties:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>with your consent, we will provide your personal information to organisations who are sponsoring or otherwise involved with or participating in a competition, survey, promotion; and</li>
			<li>we may provide your personal information to other companies or individuals to whom we outsource specialised functions (including but not limited to mailing houses, printing companies, data processors, data analysts and research companies). If we do outsource functions in this way, we take steps to ensure that those contractors:
				<ul>
					<li>comply with the NPPs when they handle personal information about you (regardless of whether they are a small business, and would otherwise be exempt from the NPPs); and</li>
					<li>are bound to use the personal information for the same purpose as the information was collected (ie in order to provide the services or to perform the functions required by myhome.com.au).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In addition, the myhome.com.au website allows you to send emails to a third party, such as our "email a friend" service.  If you provide us with personal information as part of those emails, it will be disclosed to the recipient of that email.  If a third party provides us with your personal information by using such services, we will deal with that personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy as if you had disclosed that personal information directly to us.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, myhome.com.au will only disclose personal information if required or authorised by law.</p>
