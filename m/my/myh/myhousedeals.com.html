				We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit

				While we use encryption to protect sensitive information 
				transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. 
				Only employees who need the information to perform a specific 
				job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted 
				access to personally identifiable information. The 
				computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable 
				information are kept in a secure environment. <br>
