        You provide to us while accessing and using our MyHuckleberry.com software,
        services, the website at www.myhuckleberry.com (the "Website"), and any other websites
        and services as may be added from time to time (collectively, "Service"). This Privacy

    <div class="otherMasterSubtitle">
        1. Information Collection
    </div>
    <div class="otherMasterContent">
        MyHuckleberry.com collects certain information to enable you to take full
        advantage of our offerings when you register at our site, order products or services,
        participate in our contests, surveys, promotions, or activities, or otherwise communicate
        with us. If you choose, you can visit MyHuckleberry.com without providing
        us with any information about yourself. MyHuckleberry.com collects both personally
        identifiable and non-personally identifiable information from users of its Website.
        <br>
        <br>
        You may provide certain personally identifiable information to MyHuckleberry.com,
        Inc. directly, such as your first and last name, telephone number, address, and
        email address (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information") when choosing
        to register, purchase, or use Services, participating in promotions or surveys,
        or subscribing to any newsletters or other distribution lists.
        <br>
        <br>
        When you register with MyHuckleberry.com, we require you to give us contact
        information (such as your name, email address, or physical address). We may require
        additional information for specific promotions or contests run on our Website.
        <br>
        <br>
        We may use the customer contact information we collect to connect you with a service
        provider, and to send you, if you so choose, information about our company, newsletters,
        promotional materials, and information from the service provider network.
        <br>
        <br>
        We may also use the information we collect, in combination with outside records,
        to notify you about important changes to the Website, new MyHuckleberry.com,
        services and products, and special offers and information we think you'll find valuable.
        We may send you information in conjunction with third-party partners that we think
        is relevant to your interests.
        <br>
        <br>
        We may use information gathered at the time of purchase to process your order, to
        enable the provider to fulfill your order, and to notify you of your order status.
        A customer care representative or service provider may contact you in order to fulfill
        a service you purchased or to provide information you requested.
        <br>
        <br>
        Any graphics, text, files, or any other content submitted, transmitted, or uploaded
        to the public areas of the Website or through the Website by Users ("User Submissions"),
        or other material that You make accessible to others directly, becomes published
        and public information that is not protected as "Personally Identifiable Information."
        Be aware that if your User Submissions includes personal information, such as your
        name and email address, other Users will have access to it and it will not be protected
        Personally Identifiable Information.
        <br>
        <br>
        When You visit our Website and use our Service, we may collect and store that information,
        including the following:
        <br>
        <br>
        a. Cookies. When You visit the Website, we may send one or more cookies – a small
        text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that
        identifies your web browser. You can set your web browser to refuse cookies; however,
        this may limit the functionality our Website can provide to You.
        <br>
        <br>
        b. Log Files. Your web browser automatically reports log file information each time
        You view a web page. When You register with or use the Service, our servers automatically
        record certain information that your web browser sends whenever You visit a website.
        These server logs may include information such as your IP address, browser type
        and language, number of clicks, domain names of websites visited, pages viewed,
        and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the
        date and time.
        <br>
        <br>
        c. Clear Gifs. When You use the Service, we may use clear gifs (also known as “web
        beacons”) to collect information.
        <br>
        <br>
        Information collected through clear gifs and cookies, and log file information is
        largely non-personally identifiable information because such information is not
        collected or used in such a way that an individual User can be identified, for example,
        by name or email address (collectively, "Non-Personally Identifiable Information").
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, Non-Personally Identifiable Information may be the type of browser
        you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system
        you are using, the referring site from which you came (like a partner site), and
        the domain name of your Internet service provider (like America Online or EarthLink).
        <br>
        <br>
        We use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information that we collect in the aggregate
        to improve the design and content of our site. We also use this information to analyze
        site usage.
        <br>
        <br>
        We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.
        These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address,
        or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide
        advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
    </div>
    <div class="otherMasterSubtitle">
        2. Use of Information
    </div>
    <div class="otherMasterContent">
        Collected information is used to operate, maintain, and provide to You the features
        and functionality of the Service. Any information or User Submissions that You submit
        to the Website (including on discussion boards or forums, in blogs, messages and
        chat areas, and other areas) becomes publicly available and can be collected and
        used by other Users, who may forward this information or User Submissions to other
        websites or people, making it available to the general public and, therefore, it
        will not be protected Personally Identifiable Information.
        <br>
        <br>
        We may use your Personally Identifiable Information for billing, administrative
        purposes, such as notifying You of major changes in Service, news, and for other
        customer service purposes. You hereby consent to our use of your email address to
        send you such information.
        <br>
        <br>
        We may use collected information to: (a) remember information so that You will not
        have to re-enter it during your current or subsequent visits to the Website; (b)
        provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness
        of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of
        visitors and traffic; (e) track User Submissions, and status in any promotions,
        sweepstakes, and contests; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; (g) access your
        information after You sign in; (h) market our Service to advertisers and other third
        parties; and (i) to improve the quality and design of the Service and to create
        new features by storing, tracking, and analyzing your preferences and trends.

        3. When We Disclose Information
    </div>
    <div class="otherMasterContent">
        We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
        companies, or others, including to service providers for the purposes identified
        in the preceding Section 2. If we provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information
        to such third party, their use of that Non-Personally Identifiable Information shall

        network.
        <br>

        to law enforcement or agencies, even though such agencies may not comply with the
        terms of our privacy policy. MyHuckleberry.com will disclose information to
        such agencies in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that
        the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or a law
        enforcement agency's request.

        <br>
        MyHuckleberry.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales,
        traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors,

        <br>
        In order to describe our Service to prospective partners, advertisers and other
        third parties we may disclose aggregate user information. We share Non-Personally
        Identifiable Information (such as anonymous use data) with third parties to assist
        them in understanding our Service, including Users' use of our Service and the success
        of promotions.
        <br>
        <br>
        We may release collected information if required to do so by law, or if we believe
        that such action is appropriate to comply with state and federal laws or respond
        to a court order, law enforcement request or demand, subpoena, or search warrant.
        We may share collected information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
        regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to,

        4. Service Providers
    </div>
    <div class="otherMasterContent">
        Service may be used in conjunction with services provided through a variety of third
        parties, such as Google; and MyHuckleberry.com may allow other third parties
        to serve advertisements through the Website or Service. The use of User Submissions
        and other information provided by You to such third parties is governed by their
        privacy policies, not our Privacy Policy. MyHuckleberry.com is not responsible

        You may update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information at any time using
        the Software or by sending us an email. If You or MyHuckleberry.com intend
        to delete any User Submissions provided by You, we cannot guarantee that your User
        Submissions will be completely removed from all User devices or from their web pages,

        6. Data Security
    </div>
    <div class="otherMasterContent">
        When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server.
        The secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), encrypts all information
        you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, digital certificates protect all
        of the customer transactional data we collect against unauthorized access. MyHuckleberry.com,
        Inc. uses VeriSign, one of the most established issuers of digital certificates,
        to issue digital certificates. Additionally, we use firewall security and limit
        data access to protect your personally identifiable information.
