<p>If you have asked for information or subscribed to the Website in the past and no longer use the service and do not wish us to store information about you, please contact us and we will remove your details from our customer database. We need to store information about current subscribers in order to fulfil our contractual requirements to you and in order to deliver the Website to you.</p>
