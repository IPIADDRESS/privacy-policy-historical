<p class="bold tm">California Privacy Rights Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83</p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. To make such a request, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0a7a78637c6b69734a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a><span class="domainName">web.archive.org</span>. For all requests, you must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, mail or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly or that do not have complete information.</p>
