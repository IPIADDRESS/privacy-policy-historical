    		    <li class="marginMedium"><strong>Cookies Information:</strong> When you visit the MyMuscleVideo Sites, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. MyMuscleVideo uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions.

    		    <li class="marginMedium">Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or send messages through the MyMuscleVideo Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments.

We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major MyMuscleVideo Site changes or for customer service purposes).</li>

    		    <li class="marginMedium">We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the MyMuscleVideo Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.</li>

    		    <li class="marginMedium">We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the MyMuscleVideo Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</li>

    		<h3 class="marginLarge">When MyMuscleVideo Discloses Information</h3>

    		<ul class="marginLarge paddingLarge">

    		    <li class="marginMedium">We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>

    		    <li class="marginMedium">We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</li>

    		    <li class="marginMedium">We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the MyMuscleVideo Sites.</li>

    		    <li class="marginMedium">We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</li>

    		    <li class="marginMedium">MyMuscleVideo also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that MyMuscleVideo believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our <a href="terms.jsp">Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of MyMuscleVideo, our Users or others.</li>

    		</ul>

    		<h3 class="marginLarge">Your Choices</h3>

    		<p class="marginLarge">You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the MyMuscleVideo Sites, in which case MyMuscleVideo may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. </p>

    		<p class="marginLarge">To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections.

    		<h3 class="marginLarge">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h3>

    		<p class="marginLarge">MyMuscleVideo allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the MyMuscleVideo Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the MyMuscleVideo Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p>

    		<p class="marginLarge">MyMuscleVideo does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks MyMuscleVideo to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>

    		<p class="marginLarge">You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. MyMuscleVideo's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>

    		<h3 class="marginLarge">Our Commitment To Data Security:</h3>

    		<p class="marginLarge">MyMuscleVideo uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.

Once we receive your transmission of information, MyMuscleVideo makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

    		<p class="marginLarge">If MyMuscleVideo learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. MyMuscleVideo may post a notice on the MyMuscleVideo Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify <a href="static_contact.jsp">customer service</a>.</p>

    		<h3 class="marginLarge">Our Commitment to Legal-Age Usage</h3>

    		<p class="marginLarge">Protecting children from adult ocntent is especially important. For that reason, MyMuscleVideo does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the MyMuscleVideo Sites from persons under 18 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 18, or legal age according to state law. If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the MyMuscleVideo Sites at any time or in any manner.
