<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p><strong><a id="Advt" name="Advt"></a>Advertising</strong><br>
Bank of America advertises on pages within the Sites as well as on other websites not affiliated with Bank of America. Information collected by our advertising service providers through cookies and other technologies includes the number of people who look at each of the pages on the Sites, search engine referrals, browsing patterns within the Sites, and responses to advertisements and promotions on the Sites and on websites where we advertise.</p>

<p><strong>Advertising on our Sites</strong><br>
Bank of America advertises its products and services, including prescreened offers of credit, on pages within the Sites. These advertisements may take the form of banner ads, splash ads (ads that appear as you sign on or sign off of your online accounts), and other formats. We may use information about your relationship with us, such as types of accounts you have, transactional information, or the state in which you bank to tailor advertisements that may be of interest to you.<br>
<br>
<strong>Online Behavioral Advertising on our Sites</strong><br>
We also use advertising service providers to help us determine which of our advertisements are most likely to be of interest to you using non-personal behavioral information. We limit access and collection of information for specific purposes by advertising service providers.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>If you prefer not to have non-personal information used in this way, you may <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/Control.do?body=opt_out_popup" target="_blank">opt out of online behavioral advertising on our Sites</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from Bank of America. Opting out means that the ads you do receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Advertising on other websites</strong><br>
Bank of America contracts with advertising companies to advertise our accounts and services on websites not affiliated with us.</p>

<p><strong>Online Behavioral Advertising on other websites</strong><br>
Some of these ads are online behavioral advertising and may contain cookies that allow monitoring of websites and your response to our advertisements. Cookies placed by these companies do not collect Personal Information. We limit companies that place our ads from using information for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising efforts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bank of America has adopted the use of the Advertising Options Icon on all its behaviorally targeted ads. Anyone receiving a behaviorally targeted ad may click on the displayed Icon to receive more information and can opt-out at that time or by visiting the advertising company's website.</li>

<li>You may also opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted ads from many websites through the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative’s</a> Opt Out Tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from Bank of America. Opting out from a specific advertising provider means that the ads you do receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior.<br>
<br>
In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new device, access the Sites from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Applications<br>
</strong>Bank of America’s Mobile Banking Applications for U.S. accounts (“Applications”) allows you to access your account balances, make transfers and pay bills on your mobile device in accordance with our Online Banking Service Agreement.&nbsp; This Notice applies to any Personal Information or Other Information that we may collect through the Applications.</p>

<p><strong>Linking to other sites</strong><br>
We may provide links to non-Bank of America websites, such as credit bureaus or merchants. If you follow links to websites not controlled by Bank of America, you should review their privacy policies and other terms, as they may be different from those of our Sites. Bank of America does not guarantee and is not responsible for the privacy or security of these websites, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability or suitability of their information.</p>

<p><strong>Social media sites</strong><br>
Bank of America provides experiences on social media platforms such as Facebook®, Twitter® and LinkedIn® that enable online sharing and collaboration among users who have registered to use them. Any content you post, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any Personal Information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies of those platforms. Please refer to them to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content. In addition, please note that when visiting any official Bank of America social media pages, you are also subject to the Terms and Conditions of Bank of America's Privacy Notices and User Terms.</p>

<p><strong>Using other aggregation websites</strong><br>
Other companies offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your financial account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view all your account information at one online location.&nbsp; To do this, an aggregation provider may request access to Personal Information, such as financial information, usernames and passwords.&nbsp; You should use caution and ensure that the aggregator company has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any information you provide or to which they are gaining access.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any Personal Information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your Site username and password.</p>

<p>If you provide your Site username, password or other information about your accounts with us to an aggregation website, we will consider that you have authorized all transactions initiated by an aggregation website using access information you provide, whether or not you were aware of a specific transaction.&nbsp; If you decide to revoke the authority you have given an aggregation website, we strongly recommend that you change your password for the Site to ensure that the aggregation website cannot continue to access your account.</p>

<p><strong>Making sure information is accurate</strong><br>
Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important.&nbsp; If your account information is incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please use the Contact Us option on our Site, or call or write to us at the telephone numbers or appropriate address for changes listed on your account statements, records, online or other account materials.&nbsp; You can also speak to a customer representative at a banking center, or to your financial advisor or account representative.</p>

<p><strong>Protecting children’s privacy online</strong><br>
The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that these individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Site. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 without parental consent.&nbsp; For more information about the <a href="http://business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/children’s-online-privacy" target="_blank">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</a>, visit the Federal Trade Commission website.</p>
