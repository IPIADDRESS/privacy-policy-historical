<p>Earning the trust of our users is one of MyMovingReviewsâ€™s primary goals.  We take your privacy very seriously, and we want you to feel absolutely  comfortable using our site. Our Privacy Policy answers the following  general questions:</p>

<p><strong>What information do you collect, how is it collected and how do we use it?<br>
How is my privacy protected when I leave comments?<br>
How will I know if you change your privacy policy?<br>
What kind of security measures do you take?<br>
What are the limits of your Privacy Policy?<br>
How can I change my personal information?</strong><strong><br>
What if I have more questions?<br>
 How can I be sure that you adhere to your Privacy Policy?</strong></p>

	<h2>1. What information do you collect, how is it collected and how do you use it?</h2>
<p>Anyone  can visit our site and use our mobile apps free of charge. You are welcome to browse our  ratings lists and read reviews without ever giving us your individual personal information. But we do need to gather some information about users who  wish to submit ratings and reviews. We collect information in two  ways: directly from you and through the use of "cookies". Third party services like Google Adsense may also collect information about you through cookies to display behavioral ads.</p>
<p>First, if you want to review a moving company, we will ask you to provide  some personal information. If you have already registered, you know  that the information we require is very basic: your e-mail address, name or/and password. One of the reasons we ask for your e-mail address is so that we can communicate with you and send you a validation email. As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.</p>

<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>We plan that, from time to time, we will provide certain companies  (like our advertisers) with aggregated user information. We will NOT give advertisers your personal information about you without your specific  authorization to do so, except when filling the quick quote form or the free moving calculator form or the cost calculator. We may also provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>

<p>When the quick moving quote form or the free moving calculator form or the cost calculator is filled, the information is forwarded to partnering moving companies and moving brokers that will use the information you have submitted to provide you with commercial information. The moving reviews information and the quick quote form information are not linked and are two totally separate types of information collected and saved in separate places.</p>

<p>Co-Branding Relationship: TheMovingBlog-dot-com<br>
The Moving Blog provides moving quotes using the MyMovingReviews estimation engine. The Moving Blog has no access to the personal details data that is sent to the MyMovingReviews estimation engine. Choice options may be exercised the same way as with MyMovingReviews.com.</p>

<p>Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by World Media Group, LLC and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics and/or online customer support providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking usersâ€™ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
We use cookies for for authentication, verification, to remember usersâ€™ settings (e.g. language preference and location) and for analytics. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. We use Local Storage Object (LSOs) such as Flash to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 or Flash to collect and store information.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">click here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are moving company and apply for a moving company account, please read the next chapter.</p>
<p>Of course, notwithstanding anything in this policy to the contrary, we will provide personal information if we are or believe that we are legally required to do so pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, other legal method or applicable law, when we  believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</p>
<p>If World Media Group, LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>

	<h2>2. How is my privacy protected?</h2>
<p>One of the great features of MyMovingReviews and the My Move app is that we allow you, as a user, to leave comments messages and written reviews, not just ratings, so you can explain your opinions in  some detail. Please remember that when you post your comments they are  publicly available, so you should exercise caution when deciding to  disclose anything personal about yourself. This includes your e-mail  address. Many of our users like to leave their e-mail addresses with  their reviews message. That way others can e-mail them if they want to discuss  the moving company or the specific move. You should realize that you are not obligated to attach  your email address. To request removal of your personal information from a review, contact us at info@mymovingreviews.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Alternatively, if you used a third party application to post such information, you can remove it, by either logging into the said application and removing the information or by contacting the appropriate third party application.</p>
<p>When you respond to a moving review (send a message to the reviewer), the information you enter is sent to the reviewer. We cannot guarantee how the reviewer will handle this information.</p>
<p>If you are a moving company (or you represent a moving company) and you apply for an account or update your moving company account information, the information you enter is stored behind a password and can be accessed by you and the administrators of this website. After logging into the website, you can control what information to display to the public.</p>
<p>California has passed legislation requiring certain specific disclosures be made available to California   residents who use the Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing purposes. That legislation requires any business that discloses a customer's personal information (as defined by the act) to any third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone who might have received that personal information. If you are a California resident you may request this information from MyMovingReviews, the My Move apps or any of its affiliates by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@mymovingreviews.com">info@mymovingreviews.com</a>. MyMovingReviews.com is not obligated to respond to more than one such request from you per calendar year.</p>

	<h2>3. How will I know if you change your privacy policy?</h2>
<p>This  privacy policy may be revised over time as new features are added to  the Web site. We will post those changes prominently so that you will  always know what information we gather, how we might use that  information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If we are going  to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via e-mail prior to the change becoming effective. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any  material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user  information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent  notice on our web site notifying users prior to the change becoming effective. In some cases  where we post the notice we will also e-mail users, who have opted to  receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>

	<h2>4. What kind of security measures do you take?</h2>
<p>Any information you provide, other than information you chose to provide and make publicly available in your posts or filled in the quick moving quote, is maintained and accessible  only by us, and only by those of our employees with a need to have access to such information in the performance of their work. This site has instituted commercially reasonable security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control or in our possession. Unfortunately, data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be totally secure. Additionally, we also use outside companies to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have  access to this information. Therefore, although we take measures, such as those described in this Privacy Policy, to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of information that you  provide. Accordingly, you agree that you are providing such information  at your own risk. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at info@mymovingreviews.com.</p>

	<h2>5. What are the limits of your Privacy Policy?</h2>
<p>The  MyMovingReviews web site and the My Move app contains hyperlinks and advertisements that, if  activated in the manner provided by your browser, will cause your  browser to access and display the contents of other Web sites.  MyMovingReviews does not control or have any knowledge concerning the  provisions of the privacy policies, if any, of those sites.  Accordingly, MyMovingReviews is not responsible for the privacy practices or  any of the content of those web sites and MyMovingReviewsâ€™s Privacy Policy  does not apply to those other sites. If you choose to activate a  hyperlink to another web site and if you submit personal information to any of those sites, you do so at your own risk as your information is governed by their privacy policies and you may wish to review that siteâ€™s privacy policy.</p>

	<h2>6. How can I change or delete my personal information?</h2>
<p>Users can modify or delete their personal information entered when writing a review by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@mymovingreviews.com">info@mymovingreviews.com</a> or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. The information entered in the free moving quote form or the free moving calculator form or the cost calculator form cannot be modified because it is already submitted to the moving companies that prepare the moving quotes, moving estimates and the approximate moving cost calculations. The personal information entered in the free moving quote form or the free moving calculator form or the cost calculator form is used by the moving companies to contact you with the results of the moving estimate. You might be able to change or remove that information by contacting every moving company that have contacted you or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at <a href="mailto:info@mymovingreviews.com">info@mymovingreviews.com</a>.</p>
