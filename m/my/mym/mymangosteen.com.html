			<h1>MyMangosteen.com Privacy Policy</h1>
			<h2><br>
			  Does MyMangosteen Share My Information With Outside Parties?</h2>
			<p>Absolutely not. All members and interested parties of MyMangosteen can rest assured
			  that their information will not be sold or rented to any third parties. Personal
			  information, such as billing or shipping, is kept on our secure servers.</p>
			<p>You will have access to your Powerline information, which includes the name,
			  city, and order amount of your MyMangosteen organization. Members are only
			  allowed
			  to
			  contact other MyMangosteen members in their line for support or training purposes
			  and cannot share information with others.</p>
			<h2>What information Does MyMangosteen.com Collect?</h2>
			<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us
			  in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes
			  as responding to your requests, tracking your orders and Powerline, sending
			  commission checks, improving our site, and communicating with you.</p>
			<p>When ordering products and/or registering on the site, we need you to provide certain information in order for us to create a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for users to submit information to MyMangosteen.com, LLC., and receive back either the information or products desired.</p>
			<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with
			  us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain
			  types of information when your Web browser accesses MyMangosteen.com or any of the
			  other MyMangosteen.com sites. A number of companies offer utilities designed to
			  help you visit Web sites anonymously. If you use one of these products we will
			  not be able to provide a personalized experience at MyMangosteen.com.</p>
			
			<h2>Cookies</h2>
			<p>Cookies are bits of electronic information that a Web site can transfer to
			  a visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit
			  to the site. Cookies allow Web site operators to better customize visits to
			  the site to the visitor's individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard
			  on the Internet and many major Web sites use them. Although most Web browsers
			  automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent
			  or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to
			  decide whether or not to accept it. Even without accepting a cookie, you can
			  still access most of the features on the site. MyMangosteen.com uses cookies so
			  that they can help provide its visitors with a better experience on our site.</p>
			
			<h2>Security of Personal Information</h2>
			<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission of sensitive/credit data by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. User personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems.</p>
			
			<h2>What Information can I access?</h2>
			<p>MyMangosteen.com gives you access to the following information about you for the
			  limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.

				<li>Account Information</li>
				<li>Public Profile</li>
				<li>Newsletter Subscriptions</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Kids under 13 (Special Note to Parents)</h2>
			<p>Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not collect information from children under thirteen years of age without the consent of a parent legal guardian. Parent (or legal guardians) may provide us with consent to collect such information by e-mail, by facsimile or by posted mail. Parents may request to review information collected from their child, may ask to have that information deleted, and may refuse to allow further collection or use of the child's information. To request such review or to give instructions regarding the information we have collected about a child, parents/legal guardians should contact us.</p>
			<p>We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children, to participate in the interactive activities offered online, and for children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to this or any other web site. Although guest under eighteen years of age may be allowed, with their parent's permission and supervision, to participate in noted contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes will be sent to such guest's parents or guardian. Parents should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help supervise their children's online activities. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the Direct Marketing Association home page.</p>

			  personal information about individuals except when knowingly provided by such
			  individuals (or as otherwise detailed below). Any personal information (e.g.,
			  name, e-mail address, etc.) provided by such individuals may be used in connection
			  with MyMangosteen.com websites and for such other purposes as may be indicated at

			<h2>Third Party Links</h2>
