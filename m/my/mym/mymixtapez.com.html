Facebook or Other Integrated Service, about news related to your public profile and 

activity. By way of example, such news may include that you have joined My Mixtapez, 

taken actions related to their My Mixtapez profiles or content that they subscribe to, or 

other such actions that we may think are of interest to them. Likewise, we may notify 

you about such activity of other users.


<p></p>

<h4 class="align_left">4.2 Sharing with Facebook and other services</h4>

Should you elect to connect to the

automatically share your activity and activity-related stories with the service, including, 

but not limited to, the music you may be currently listening to. You understand, 

acknowledge and agree that such information may be attributed to your account on 

Facebook or the Other Integrated Service, and may be published on such service. In the

<p>My Mixtapez also allows users the ability to share a particular item of content, on an

individual basis, to third party services or other My Mixtapez users by using the “Share”

third party service may be posted as an activity on the Services, regardless of your 

account settings. In order to share an individual item of content to a third party service, 

you will be asked to enter your access credentials for that third party service. My 

Mixtapez may store your username and access token, or other similar credentials 

obtained from the third party services, for the purpose of granting you the ability to 

share particular items of content, on that third party service, on an individual basis, 

without having to re-enter your access credentials. You understand, acknowledge and 

agree that Facebook’s and/or Other Integrated Services’ use of your personal

that My Mixtapez use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy, and that

precautions in order to prohibit third party application providers from attempting to 

identify you by using the information provided to them, or by collecting additional 

information without your prior consent. However, please note that if you: (1) actively 

choose to provide third party application with additional information, such as by visiting 

a third party application (thus enabling collection of your IP address), dragging and 

dropping a playlist into a third party application, or allowing us to share your location 

when third party application providers request same from us; or (2) consent to collection 

of additional information about you by a third party application provider by, for 

example, registering or logging in to the third party application, the third party 

application may be able to identify and associate the information previously provided by

application provider’s respective privacy policy governs their use of your personal 

information, and that My Mixtapez neither controls, nor has any authority, over the third 

party application provider’s use of your personal information, or their respective privacy
