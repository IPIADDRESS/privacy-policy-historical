Your activity on the Service, including, but not limited to, music you listen to or add to your profile and third party applications that you add or use will automatically appear in the activity feed of friends. We may use your information to notify others though the Service, or via email, Facebook or Other Integrated Service, about news related to your public profile and activity. By way of example, such news may include that you have joined My Mixtapez, taken actions related to their My Mixtapez profiles or content that they subscribe to, or other such actions that we may think are of interest to them. Likewise, we may notify you about such activity of other users.</p>
<h4><strong>4.2. Sharing with Facebook and other services</strong></h4>
<p>Should you elect to connect to the My Mixtapez Service using your Facebook account, or otherwise connect your My Mixtapez membership account to an Other Integrated Service, My Mixtapez will automatically share your activity and activity-related stories with the service, including, but not limited to, the music you may be currently listening to. You understand, acknowledge and agree that such information may be attributed to your account on Facebook or the Other Integrated Service, and may be published on such service.

Please note that the sharing of such content on a third party service may be posted as an activity on the Services, regardless of your account settings. In order to share an individual item of content to a third party service, you will be asked to enter your access credentials for that third party service. My Mixtapez may store your username and access token, or other similar credentials obtained from the third party services, for the purpose of granting you the ability to share particular items of content, on that third party service, on an individual basis, without having to re-enter your access credentials. You understand, acknowledge and agree that Facebook’s and/or Other Integrated Services’ use of your personal information that they collect from you is governed by their respective privacy polies, that My Mixtapez use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy, and that My Mixtapez neither controls, nor has any authority, over the Facebook’s and/or Other Integrated Services use of your personal information, or their respective privacy policies.</p>
<h4><strong>4.3. Sharing with Third Party Applications</strong></h4>
<p>For the purpose of personalizing your experience with the Service, My Mixtapez may share information collected from you with providers of third party applications. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your locations, musical preferences, settings and/or technical data. My Mixtapez takes great precautions in order to prohibit third party application providers from attempting to identify you by using the information provided to them, or by collecting additional information without your prior consent. However, please note that if you: (1) actively choose to provide third party application with additional information, such as by visiting a third party application (thus enabling collection of your IP address), dragging and dropping a playlist into a third party application, or allowing us to share your location when third party application providers request same from us; or (2) consent to collection of additional information about you by a third party application provider by, for example, registering or logging in to the third party application, the third party application may be able to identify and associate the information previously provided by My Mixtapez with you. You understand, acknowledge and agree that a third party application provider’s respective privacy policy governs their use of your personal information, and that My Mixtapez neither controls, nor has any authority, over the third party application provider’s use of your personal information, or their respective privacy policies.</p>
<h4><strong>4.4. Service providers and others</strong></h4>
<p>From time to time, My Mixtapez may engage other companies and third party service providers for the purpose of performing certain functions and processing user data, subject to the terms contained in Section 3 above. Such third party service providers’ processing of user data will be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with the terms and provisions contained within this Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions of Use incorporated herein, and applicable law.</p>
<h4><strong>4.5. Other sharing</strong></h4>

<ul>

<h3><strong>5. Your preferences</strong></h3>
<p>Though your My Mixtapez membership account settings, you have the option of choosing what communications you receive from us, managing your public profile information, and setting your sharing preferences. However, please note that it may not be possible to make certain information private on the Service, such as your name and/or username and profile picture. Information that is set to "public" in your settings may be used, re-shared or linked to by others on the Service or across the web. As a result, you should be careful to use the My Mixtapez in a manner you are comfortable with and should manage your account settings regularly and accordingly. If you elect to set your profile content to "private," others who already subscribe or otherwise have the details of such content will still have access to it. Additionally, playlists and other content included in your profile may include personal information, such as your username, which may enable others to find you through the My Mixtapez Service or other services.</p>

For example, information collected within Switzerland may be transferred to, and processed in, a country that is not Switzerland. Your continued use of the My Mixtapez Service serves as your express consent to such action. In the event you do agree to be bound by this provision, your only option is to discontinue using the My Mixtapez Service.</p>

You click on a link and/or advertisement to a Third Party Website at your own risk. Please read the respective privacy policy of the applicable third party website in order to better understand how it collects and processes your personal information.</p>
