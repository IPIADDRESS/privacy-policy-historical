share information gathered from our online visitors.<br> <br> This Privacy Statement applies to http://www.mymove.com and all other external websites, web-hosted applications, web pages and/or web properties owned and operated by Imagitas, Inc. a Pitney Bowes company, (“Imagitas”) referred to in this statement as "Sites," except to the extent such other websites contain their own Privacy Statement.<strong><br> <br> </strong><strong>The following topics are presented in this Privacy Statement:</strong><strong><br> </strong><br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Collecting Personal Information from Website Visitors <br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Collecting Other Information <br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Personal Information <br> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing Personal Information <br> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Protecting Personal Information <br> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Transferring Personal Information to Other Countries <br> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting Non-Imagitas Websites<br> 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Country-Specific Requirements <br> 9. &nbsp;&nbsp;Your Choices <br> 10. Our Right to Change this Privacy Statement <br> <strong><br> <strong>1. Collecting Personal Information from Website Visitors</strong></strong> <br> In order to provide you with access to certain services or data within our Sites, we may require that you provide certain personal information. This information may include your name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, subscriber name or screen name, password used to access our services, method of payment, and, if applicable, payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date associated with online purchases. <br> The Personal Information you provide when you become a registered user or customer of the Site is used primarily to help us customize your online experience, increase the convenience of accessing new tools, products and services, and, if applicable, provide the products and/or services you purchase or request. This Personal Information may also be used to make your use of the Site more convenient by, for example, limiting the number of times you have to register with us. If registration is available and You register with the Site, You will be assigned a unique identifier in our record system, that together with your password, is designed to prevent unauthorized access to any information you choose to store on the Site.<strong> </strong>The data you give us about your personal preferences and demographics (e.g., your age, ZIP code, occupation or the like) may be used to help us offer content, advertisements, products, and services that we believe will be of interest to you. In addition, we may share this information, with our current and potential advertisers so that they can present advertisements more effectively. <br> In addition, we collect (1) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with us via e-mail, post messages to our bulletin boards or post messages to our chat groups, and (2) information provided by visitors in registration forms, surveys, contest entries, and other submissions to us. <br> We also collect and track automatically (1) the home server domain names, IP addresses, type of client computer, and type of web browser of visitors to our Sites, and (2) aggregate and specific information on what pages visitors access.<br> <strong><br> 2. Collecting Other Information</strong> <br> Imagitas uses several automatic data collection tools and techniques including cookies, clickstream, and web beacons. <br> <strong><br> Cookies</strong><br> Some of our Sites use a technology called "cookies" so that we can better serve visitors when they &nbsp;visit our Sites, request additional information about our company, products or services, or participate in various activities posted on our Sites. &nbsp; A cookie is a bit of text that is placed on a user's computer hard drive when certain websites are visited. <br> These cookies may be placed by us or by third party vendors and are used to obtain data such as user name, shopping cart contents, and web pages or advertisements viewed by the visitor. When the visitor revisits our Sites, we can recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly. <br> You can set your browser to provide notice whenever a cookie is received, which gives you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it or not.&nbsp; Without cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Site features. For example, if you turn off cookies or refuse them, you may not be able to view or participate in certain valuable savings or services.&nbsp; <br> In addition, we and our service providers sometimes use "clear GIFs" in connection with cookies and other website functions. Clear GIFs perform administrative functions without detracting from your online experience. They may be used to perform statistical and administrative tasks including measuring site and page traffic, verifying advertising avenues and positioning images on the web. Clear GIFs do not collect Personal Information.<br> <strong><br> Clickstream</strong><br> Certain of our Sites may collect information about the "clickstream" of our customers during their visit to our Sites. This clickstream data contains the pages the visitors came from, the navigational paths they took, and the areas of the Sites they visited. <br> From time to time, we track such information inside and outside of our Sites.&nbsp; Additionally, we may from time to time track and match clickstream data with personal information you provide to us in order to deliver content and other offerings - i.e., products and services that might improve your customer experience. <br> <strong><br> Web Beacon</strong><br> Certain email communications you may receive from us may contain "web beacons." &nbsp; Web beacons consist of a line of code on our Sites that delivers a small graphic image from another website or third-party ad server. The web beacon may not be visible as it is generally a 1x1 pixel that is often designed to blend into the background of a web page. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page and the information in cookies set by the third party.&nbsp; We may use web beacons for activities such as monitoring the effectiveness of the content, advertising, or promotions in our email distributions.</p> <p><strong>3. Using Personal Information</strong> <br> Personal information we collect through our Sites will be used to, among other things, fulfill orders and requests for information, for marketing and promoting products and services of Imagitas and other entities that we believe you may find of interest, for feedback purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development or enhancement, for content improvement, to notify you of upcoming events and to customize content and layout of our Sites. Names, postal and e-mail addresses, and phone numbers collected through our Sites may be used to contact you regarding products and services and upcoming events we believe you might find of interest. <br> We also may use the personal information you provide for Imagitas internal purposes, such as administration and operation of our Sites, data analytics, and compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures. <br> <strong><br> 4. Sharing Personal Information</strong> <br> We do not share or otherwise disclose personal information about our Site visitors, except as described here or where permitted by law.&nbsp; Imagitas may share your personal information within the Imagitas family of businesses and with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf (for example, advertisers, service providers, credit card companies, financial institutions, shipping companies, consultants, advisors and market research firms).&nbsp; We also may disclose personal information when, in our judgment, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to prevent fraud, injury, or harm to persons or property, to protect our rights or the rights of others, or as otherwise required by applicable law, regulation or legal process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> For products and services offered to you jointly by us and a third party, your Personal Information may be shared with or independently gathered by the third party. In these situations, Imagitas will only use your Personal Information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, but the third party may use the information in different ways. You can tell when a product or service is offered by a third party, because a page or relevant portion of the page on the Sites &nbsp;will display the third party's logo and/or name along with our own, or you will be linked to the third party's site to complete the transaction. Please be aware that each company we do business with has its own policies regarding the use and protection of your information that may differ from those outlined in this Privacy Policy. <br> Referrals: If you opt in to participate in any referral service we may offer, we use the information you submit to determine which of our participating professional(s) may be able to serve your needs. We may then forward your information, which may include Personal Information, contained on our sign-up form to certain professional(s), who may then contact you. <br> We also may provide, rent, sell or otherwise share the personal information we collect from you for marketing campaigns conducted by us or other companies or organizations that offer products or services we believe may be of interest to our customers. Personal information may also be transferred in connection with a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, insolvency, or asset sale involving any Imagitas business or asset to which the information pertains.&nbsp; Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Statement.<br> <strong><br> 5. Protecting Personal Information</strong> <br> We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of personal information you provide on our Sites.<br> <strong><br> 6. Transferring Personal Information to Other Countries</strong> <br> Where permitted by local laws and regulatory requirements, we may transfer the personal information we collect on our Sites to other countries where we, and our service providers, do business, but we will do so only for the purposes described above. <br> <strong><br> 7. Visiting Non-Imagitas Websites</strong> <br> This privacy statement applies solely to information collected during your use of our Sites. Our Sites may contain links to other websites that may operate independently from Imagitas.&nbsp; These and other websites may also reference or link to our Sites.<br> Imagitas is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other non-Imagitas websites.&nbsp; We encourage you to be aware of the privacy statements of each and every website with which you may interact.<br> <strong><br> 8. Country-Specific Requirements</strong> <br> Imagitas Inc. is a subsidiary of Pitney Bowes, Inc. a global corporation with subsidiary companies located around the world.&nbsp; This Privacy Statement establishes Pitney Bowes’ global principles for the collection, use and disclosure of information gathered through our Sites. &nbsp; The country in which you are doing business with us or where the Site you are visiting is located/hosted may have specific requirements concerning personal information.<br> <strong><br> 10. Your Choices</strong> <br> If you wish to update or remove your personal information, opt out from receiving, or opt in to receive, marketing communications from us please do so by indicating your preferences on the relevant Site or by contacting us at the mail or email address below.&nbsp; If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Statement, please contact us at:<br> <br> Imagitas Privacy Officer<br> 48 Woerd Ave., Waltham, MA 02453 <br> or<br> <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@imagitas.pb.com">privacyofficer@imagitas.pb.com</a>; (781) 906-4800<br> <br> Where required by law, you may request access to your personal information that we maintain.&nbsp; As permitted by law, we may charge a reasonable fee for providing access to personal information, but we do not charge for lodging a request for access.<br> <strong><br> 11. Our Right to Change this Privacy Statement</strong> <br> This Privacy Statement may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our online information practices. We will indicate at the top of the statement when it was most recently updated.
