					HOW WE 
					PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY.</strong><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
					</b>This privacy policy tells you how we collect, use, and 
					protect your personal information. By visiting our website, 
					you accept and agree to the terms and conditions of this 
					privacy policy. In particular, you consent to our collection 
					and use of your personal information as described in this 
					privacy policy.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial;" class="style2"><strong>
					MINORS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></strong><b><br>
					</b>We do not provide services or sell products to children. 
					If you are below the age of 18, you may use our website only 
					with the permission and active involvement of a parent or 
					legal guardian. If you are a minor, please do not provide us 
					or other website visitors with any personal information.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial;" class="style2"><strong>THIS 
					POLICY IS PART OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE.</strong><b><br>
					</b>Our privacy policy is part of, and subject to, our 
					website's terms and conditions of use. You may view these 
					terms and conditions on our website.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial;" class="style2"><strong>THE 
					TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU.</strong><br>
					Like most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our 
					website you automatically tell us certain information. This 
					includes basic information such as your IP address, when you 
					visited, the website from where you came prior to visiting 
					us, the website where you go when you leave our website, 
					your computer's operating system, and the type of web 
					browser that you are using. Our website automatically 
					records this basic information about you.<br>
					<br>
					And like many other websites, we may use cookies. In plain 
					English, this means information that our website's server 
					transfers to your computer. This information can be used to 
					track your session on our website. Cookies may also be used 
					to customize our website content for you as an individual. 
					If you are using one of the common Internet web browsers, 
					you can set up your browser to either let you know when you 
					receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.<br>
					<br>
					We may also collect any data that you provide us by posting 
					it at our website or by e-mail. You can always choose not to 
					provide us with information. However, if you do withhold 
					information, we may deny you access to some or all of our 
					website's services and features.<br>
					<br>
					Some transactions between you and our website may involve 
					payment by credit card, debit card, checks, money orders, 
					and/or third party online payment services. In such 
					transactions, we will collect information related to the 
					transaction as part of the course of doing business with 
					you, including your billing address, telephone number, and 
					other information related to the transaction.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial;" class="style2"><strong>WHAT 
					WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION.</strong><b><br>
					</b>We use your information to operate our website's 
					business activities. For example, we may use this data to 
					contact you about changes to our website, new services, or 
					special offers, resolve disputes, troubleshoot issues, and 
					enforce our website's terms and conditions.<br>
					<br>
					As a general rule, we will not give your data to third 
					parties without your permission. However, there are some 
					important exceptions to this rule that are described in the 
					following paragraphs.<br>
					<br>
					We may, in our sole discretion, provide information about 
					you to law enforcement or other government officials for 
					purposes of fraud investigations, alleged intellectual 
					property infringement, or any other suspected illegal 
					activity or matters that may expose us to legal liability.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial;" class="style2">Although we do 
					not disclose individually identifiable information, we may 
					disclose aggregate data about our website's visitors to 
					advertisers or other third parties for marketing and 
					promotional purposes.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial;" class="style2">From time to 
					time, we may use third party suppliers to provide services 
					on our website. If a supplier wants to collect information 
					about you, you will be notified. However, you will never be 
					required to give information to a third party supplier. We 
					restrict the way third party suppliers can use your 
					information. They are not allowed to sell or give your 
					information to others.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS.</strong><b><br>
					</b>Your access to parts of our website may be protected by 
					a user name and a password. Do not give your password to 
					anyone. If you enter a section of our website that requires 
					a password, you should log out when you leave. As a safety 
					precaution, you should also close out of your web browser 
					completely and re-open it before viewing other parts of the 
					Internet.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>YOUR USE OF INFORMATION AND UNSOLICITED JUNK E-MAIL.</strong><b><br>
					</b>If you obtain personally identifiable information about 
					another website user, you are not allowed to disclose this 
					information to anyone else without the consent of the user 
					and our consent too.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial;" class="style2">We hate Spam 
					(junk e-mail). Information you obtain from our website about 
					us or other site users cannot be used by you or others to 
					send unsolicited commercial e-mail or to send unsolicited 
					commercial communications via our website's posting or other 
					communication systems.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial;" class="style2"><strong>YOUR 
					VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE 
					NOT OUR SUPPLIERS</strong><b>.<br>
					</b>You may choose to provide personal information to 
					website visitors or other third parties who are not our 
					suppliers. Please use caution when doing so. The privacy 
					policies and customs of these third parties determine what 
					is done with your information.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial;" class="style2"><strong>
					AUTORESPONDERS.</strong><b><br>
					</b>We may use autoresponders to communicate with you by 
					e-mail. To protect your privacy, we use a verified opt-in 
					system for such communications and you can always opt-out of 
					such communications using the links contained in each 
					autoresponder message. If you have difficulties opting out, 
					you may contact us by writing via our website contact form.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial;" class="style2"><strong>POLICY 
					CHANGES.</strong><font size="2"><br>

					time. If such changes are made, we will notify you by a

					been made, please contact us (by using our website support 
					form), and any changes made to this policy will not apply to 
					information we have collected from you prior to making the 
					changes.<br>
