<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>

<p>This policy discloses what information we gather about you when 
you visit MySQL.com or buy product directly from us. It describes 
how we use that information and how you can control it.</p>


<h2>Information MySQL AB gathers and tracks</h2>

<p>MySQL AB collects two kinds of information about users: 1) data 
that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product 
information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying 
directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect 
when users interact with us.</p>


<h2>Personal information</h2>

<p>We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send 
information you've requested and to fulfill orders. The specific 
use of your personal information varies, depending on how you 
contact us:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you subscribe to MySQL mailing lists to receive MySQL news
and product information, you must provide email address. We never 
sell or rent your email address you provide when subscribing to 
our lists. Please note, that MySQL mailing lists are archived by
several third party sites and your email address can be found from
their archives and MySQL AB doesn't have control over those archives.</li>

<li>When you order MySQL commercial licenses, or purchase commercial
support, or buy training, we add you to our mailing lists and will
contact you in MySQL related issues now and then.</li>

<li>When you enter a contest or survey, we may ask for your name, 
address, and email address so we can administer the contest and 
notify winners.</li>

</ul>

<p>We release personal information when we believe that release is 
appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, 
property, or safety of MySQL AB, our users, or others. This may 
include exchanging information with other companies and 
organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>


<h2>Aggregated tracking information</h2>

<p>We analyze visitors' use of our sites by tracking information 
such as pageviews, traffic flow, search terms, and click
through. We use this information to improve our sites. We also 
share this anonymous traffic and demographic information in 
aggregate form with advertisers and other business partners. 
We do not share any information with advertisers that can 
identify an individual user.</p>

<h2>Log Files</h2>

<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, 
track user movement, and gather broad demographic information 
for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally 
identifiable information.</p>

<h2>Cookies &amp; Advertising</h2>

<p>A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your 
computer's hard drive through your web browser when you
visit our sites. Cookies enable our systems to recognize 
your computer, so that we can provide you with personalized 
information and features. We do not use cookies to track 
user traffic patterns.</p>

<p>We may use an outside advertising company to display
advertisements on our site. These advertisements may contain
cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web Site,
cookies received with banner or other ads are collected by
these advertising companies, and we do not have access to
this information.</p>

or to block cookies. If you block cookies, you may not be 
able to use certain site features or functions.</p>

<h2>Services</h2>

<p>This site contains links to other sites. MySQL AB is not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other
Web Sites.</p>


<h2>Contests &amp; Surveys</h2>

<p>We may run contests or surveys on our site in which we ask 
our users for contact information (like their email address). 
We use the customer contact information from the entry form 
to send the user information about our company and its 
products, or to contact them when it becomes necessary 
(notices like, updates, patches, etc...). Users may opt-out 
of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section 
below).</p>


<h2>Security</h2>

<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss,
misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All
the data regarding users, their computers' system information
and benchmark results are stored on a server. This server is
located in a locked and guarded space and only authorized
MySQL AB personnel have access to the database
containing given user names and passwords.</p>

<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>

<p>If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those 
changes on www.mysql.com. If we decide to use personally
identifiable information in a manner different from that 
stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users 
via email. Users will be able to opt out of any new use of 
their personal information.</p>

<h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>

<p>Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
communications from us and from our partners at the point
where we request information about the user.</p>

<p>This site gives users the following options for removing their
information from our database so that they no longer receive
future communications or access to our other services:</p>

 <li>You can reply to any unwanted communications that you receive, stating your request.</li>
