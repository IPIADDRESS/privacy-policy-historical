    <h2>Log Files and Cookies</h2>
    <p>This website utilizes industry standard analytics packages which gathers limited information on visitors to our website automatically, and stores this anonymous information in server log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, basic IP information, referring pages, operating system used and date/time stamps. This information does not identify individual users; it is used only for site administration, as well as for analysis of website usage and trends.</p>

Cookies are very small text files that are stored on personal computers for reference purposes. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you have submitted while on our site.</p>
    <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when your browser is closed, and a persistent cookie may stay on your hard drive for an extended period. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our site; persistent cookies can perform such activities as storing your password for forums or blogs so you do not have to sign in every time you visit those areas, and/or may be used to enable us to track and target the interests of our users so as to enhance the overall experience of using our site.</p>
    <p>We use remarketing tags which means that third party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites on the internet and use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website. You may opt out of Google's and other vendor's use of remarketing cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/" target="_blank">Google advertising opt-out page</a> or/and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a>.</p>
