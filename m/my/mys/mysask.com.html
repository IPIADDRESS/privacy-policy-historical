    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        Protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal information is our highest priority. DirectWest
        has created this privacy policy to set out how we collect, use, and safeguard any personal information of
        individuals using any platform owned by DirectWest including www.directwest.com,
        www.mysask411.com, teammysask411.com, and the Mysask411 app (collectively referred to as "Digital
        Platforms").
    </p>

    <h3>Our commitment to your privacy</h3>

    <p>
        We place a high priority on the loyalty of our customers, and that loyalty is built on a foundation of good
        products, competitive prices, and, above all, excellent customer service.
    </p>

    <p>
        Respecting your right to privacy is an important part of our service excellence commitment. We promise
        to treat your personal information with the utmost respect. That includes keeping you up-to-date on
        your rights as our customer and providing you with information on how we use your personal
        information. Our Privacy Statement outlines our commitment to protect the privacy and confidentiality
        of your personal information.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may update this statement from time to time as reflected in the date at the end of this page, so
        please review it periodically. You're also encouraged to review the Terms and Conditions and Terms of
        Use documents provided on this website. They, too, are provided for your information and protection.
    </p>

    <h3>Why we collect personal information</h3>

    <p>
        Personal information is defined as information about an identifiable individual. Publicly available
        information—like a public telephone book listing of your name, address, and telephone number—is not
        considered personal information.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to provide you with products and services, we may need to collect information from you. We
        might collect information from you in person, over the phone, by mail, through the Internet, from our
        Digital Platforms, in writing or verbally. We understand that some of this information is confidential,
        which is why we collect personal information only for the following purposes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>To establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with you and to provide you
            with ongoing service.</li>
        <li>To understand your needs and develop and recommend suitable products and services. We
            maintain a record of products and services you receive from us, and we may ask you for
            additional information so we can serve you better.</li>
        <li>To develop, enhance, market or provide products and services to you.</li>
        <li>To manage and develop our business and operations, including personnel and employment matters.</li>
        <li>To meet legal and regulatory requirements. For example, we may collect information to respond
            to a court order.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sharing your personal information</h3>

    <p>Private personal information is not sold or rented to any parties outside of DirectWest without your consent.</p>

    <p>
        We do share this information with the companies we select as our business partners, and who supply
        services to us. However, we require them, by contract, to honour our privacy principles in the handling
        of personal information they obtain from us.
    </p>

    <p>
        The information provided to our business partners is used only for that purpose and any disclosure
        outside of DirectWest is made on a confidential basis.&nbsp;Should we sell a part of our business or merge or
        amalgamate part or all of our business with another entity, we may need to disclose customer
        information as part of the transaction. This is a normal business practice in any such transaction. Any
        such disclosure would be subject to appropriate privacy and security safeguards. In certain
        circumstances in which it is necessary to do so, or where permitted by law, we may disclose your
        personal information without your consent to the following parties:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The customer or an agent acting on the customer's behalf, such as Power of Attorney;</li>
        <li>Companies we select as our business partners;</li>
        <li>A company that publishes a directory or directory-related services;</li>
        <li>A collection agency or party used to determine creditworthiness, or for collecting unpaid balances;</li>
        <li>Courts, law enforcement agencies, or otherwise legally empowered entities;</li>
        <li>We may disclose personal information to meet legal or regulatory requirements, such as under a
            court order or, to a government institution if required or authorized by law;</li>
        <li>To public authorities or their agents in cases of emergency, e.g., a 911 call;</li>
        <li>Ombudsman</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How we safeguard your information</h3>

    <p>
        The information you provide to us on our digital platforms is securely maintained and kept confidential.
        Information is retained in secure facilities, and protected from unauthorized access. We provide
        technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your information against loss,
        misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal information handling principles</h3>

    <p>
        We've always been, and will continue to be, committed to the privacy of your personal information. In
        addition to our existing procedures and our adherence to the Freedom of Information and Protection of
        Privacy Act (FOIP), which governs our approach to handling personal information, we've adopted the

        <dt>Principle 7 - Security safeguards</dt>

        <dt>Principle 8 - Openness</dt>

    </dl>

    <p>
        Our personnel are required to complete mandatory privacy training courses, and general staff education
        and training, to enhance awareness of responsibilities and commitments towards the proper handling of
        customer's personal information in accordance with our policies and procedures.
    </p>

    <h3>What are your choices?</h3>

    <p>
        We'd like to have your consent to continue to collect, use, and disclose your personal information for
        the purposes that we have outlined. However, you do have choices.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You can have your name removed from our telephone, mail, or email marketing lists. By doing
            so, you may not be made aware of certain products, services, and promotions we offer.
            However, you'll continue to be contacted as necessary to service your account, and you'll
            receive marketing information included with your regular account mailings. Please allow us 30
            days to complete your request. Some of our promotions may already be in progress when you
            submit your request, therefore you may be contacted during this time. If at any time you wish to
            reverse your decision, you may contact us at 1-800-667-8201.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may refuse to provide personal information to us. You may also withdraw your consent at
            any time, subject to legal, contractual, or practical restrictions and reasonable notice. However,
            in either case, this may limit our ability to serve you.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        When you contact us, we will confirm that you are the registered customer. Please know that
        withdrawing your consent may prevent us from providing you with service and products in certain
        circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are a few activities where the collection of personally identifiable information may be necessary.
        When personally identifiable information is collected, you'll know because you'll have chosen to provide
        your information.
    </p>

    <h3>IP address</h3>

    <p>
        When you visit our sites, we collect your IP address so we'll know where to send the information you are

    </p>

    <h3>Anonymous information</h3>

    <p>
        This is information that cannot be associated with a specific individual. Our web servers collect some
        anonymous information automatically when you visit one of our Digital Platforms. This information may
        include the pages you visited, what content you downloaded, the type of web browser you were using,
        and the level of encryption your browser supports.
    </p>

    <p>

        statistics. We use this information to determine what type of information is most useful to you so that
        we can improve our platforms to make it easier for you to access information.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>

    <p>
        Our sites collect aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies, small text files containing a unique
        identification number that identifies your browser to our computers. This small file of information
        allows our websites to remember important information that will make your use of our sites more
        enjoyable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cookies tell us which pages are visited, by how many people, the average time spent, and other useful
        statistics relating to the use of our sites. All gathered information is captured on an anonymous basis.
        This information helps us to enhance the online experience of visitors to our sites. We use the statistics

    <h3>Children</h3>

    <p>
        The privacy of children is important to us. We encourage parents to review our Privacy Statement and
        our Legal Notices and User Agreement documents. We ask that children do not submit any personal
        information to us. Our services are intended for individuals who can form legally binding contracts. We
        do not use our digital platforms to intentionally collect or use a child's personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an added protection for children, on any of our Digital Platforms or online services directed to
        children under 13 years of age, we'll obtain the permission of a parent or legal guardian before
        collecting, using, or disclosing any personally identifiable information about a child, e.g., for participation
        in contests or promotions.
    </p>
