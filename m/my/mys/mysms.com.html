<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last update: February 9, 2012</p>
<br>
<p>mysms takes privacy very seriously. We recognize that our customers, visitors, users want to know what information we collect and how we use it. That is why we provide this Privacy Notice to help you make an informed decision about whether you want to use or continue using mysms websites, mysms applications and other mysms services ("mysms Services").</p>
<br>
<strong>The information mysms collects:</strong>
<strong>Information you provide:</strong>
<p>When you use mysms Services you provide certain information (such as your phone number, password, email address) to mysms. You also allow access to information on your phone (contact list, SMS message inbox) when choosing to use mysms Services. Depending on the type of mysms Service, this information may be transmitted, stored and used to provide you with a better experience.</p>
<br>
<strong>User communications:</strong>
<p>When using mysms Services you may exchange private messages (including, but not limited to text, images, video, and any file) with whom you choose. Text messages are encrypted and sent via SSL, ensuring the maximum security for your data. We may maintain information associated with those messages, such as the phone number, date and time of transaction, and content of the message. None of the information that you send is ever made public, unless you explicitly opt-in for that.</p>
<br>
<strong>Cookies information:</strong>
<p>Like many websites mysms may use "cookies" when you visit or use mysms Services. A cookie is a small text file that uniquely identifies your browser. mysms uses secure cookies for the mysms applications that means the cookie is always encrypted when transmitting from client to server. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can adjust your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However the mysms Services may not work properly when cookies are disabled.</p>
<br>
<strong>Log file information:</strong>
<p>When you use mysms Services, our servers automatically collect information. Log file information may include information such as Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser type, browser language, date and time, what features you use and for how long, "cookies", the type and unique number of the device you use to access the mysms Service, your mobile operator and other information regarding your use of the service.</p>
<br>
<strong>Links:</strong>
<p>We may keep track of your interaction with the links we use in texts and updates. We do this in order to improve the mysms Services.</p>
<br>

<strong>The use of the information collected:</strong>
<p>In general, we use the information we collect to operate, maintain and provide to you the mysms Services. We also try to improve and personalize your use of mysms Services based on this information. In addition, we may use your personal information to inform you about developments of the mysms Services (e.g. notifying you about major updates of the mysms service) and promotional activities carried out by mysms. We also use the information that we collect for analyzing user preferences and for reporting. This allows us to improve the mysms Services, create new features, promotions and identify technical problems.</p>
<br>
<strong>Third party services:</strong>
<p>mysms uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide and improve our Services, such as Google Analytics.
