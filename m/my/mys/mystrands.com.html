MyStrands is the sole owner of all information collected via its products. In order to use certain parts of the Web Site or the MyStrands client, users must first complete the registration form. During registration users are required to give contact information - most of this contact information is optional; only a valid email address is required to successfully register.
    </p>

    <h3>Information Use</h3>

        <h4>Profile</h4>
        <p>
            Information about users and user preferences are collected via the Web Site, Mystrands Clients for PC, Mac, Mobile, etc.  Users can permanently delete their information, individual playcounts, and/or profile.  MyStrands is the sole owner of all information collected via the Web Site. MyStrands collects information from users at several different points on the Web Site.

In order to use certain parts of the Web Site, users must first complete the registration form. During registration users are required to give contact information - most of this contact information is optional; only a valid email address is required to successfully register.
        </p>

        <h4>MyStrands</h4>
        <p>
            Play stream data includes information on songs a user is playing. MyStrands uses this data to power its recommendation engine, there by giving users a better personalized experience. Aggregate statistics of this data is viewable in the user profile on the MyStrands website and such data may be provided in affiliated and demonstration web site.
        </p>

        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>
            A cookie is a set of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. By setting a cookie on the Web Site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the Web Site. If a user rejects the cookie, the user may still use the Web Site, but the user will be limited in some areas of the Web Site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and foster the interests of our users to enhance the experience on the Web Site.
        </p>

        <h4>Log Files</h4>
        <p>
            Most standard web site servers use log files, and so do we. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
        </p>

        <h4> Cell Phones</h4>
        <p>
            If you access our service via cell phone and/or web portal, MyStrands stores the SMS/MMS content as well as information relayed to us by third party providers such as encrypted cell phone numbers, the time the message was sent and the name of the mobile operator.  MyStrands uses this data to allow users to participate in partyStrands and to enhance users' partyStrands experience.
        </p>

    <h3>Communications from the Site Customer Service</h3>
    <p>
        We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account.
    </p>

        <h4>Service Announcements</h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. These communications are not promotional in nature.
        </p>

    <h3>Special Offers</h3>
    <p>
        Members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, users will be presented with an option to not receive these communications prior to the first such electronic mailing. Your response will apply to any subsequent mailings until you elect to change your preferences.
    </p>

    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <p>
        New members receive a welcoming email to verify password and username. Users may also receive emails regarding changes in MyStrands functionality and policies.
    </p>

    <h3>Sharing</h3>

        <h4>Legal Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>
            Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on the Web Site.
        </p>

        <h4>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h4>

        <p>
            We reserve the right to share aggregated demographic information and user preferences with third parties and in public demonstrations. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.
        </p>

        <h4>Third Party Advertisers</h4>
        <p>
            MyStrands reserves the right to share aggregated Web Site usage information with a reputable third party advertiser for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on this site and other sites.
        </p>

        <h4>Business Transitions</h4>

        <p>
            In the event MyStrands goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, co-branding a product, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
        </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <h3>Sharing Profiles</h3>

    <p>
        If a registered user elects to use our "Share my profile" feature, we ask them for a Screen Name. Subsequently, their profile, including Music, Community, Parties, Journals, Photos, Videos, and Shoutbox, will be available to the entire registered community but only in association with the user-supplied Screen Name. The registered user may deselect this feature at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
        A registered user may elect to allow other partygoers to send SMS messages to their cell phone, and to receive info from Parties on their cell phone. If a user elects this option, they will be available via SMS to the entire registered community but only in association with the user-supplied Screen Name. User's phone numbers will not be shared. The registered user may deselect these features at any time.
    </p>


    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
        MyStrands takes reasonable precautions in accordance with industry standards to protect our users' information. When users submit information via the Web Site, their information is protected both online and off-line. All users' information is subject to restricted access in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility. MyStrands maintains notification procedures as part of its information security policy for notifying you in the event of a data security breach.  If MyStrands experiences a data security breach and is required to notify you under applicable law, MyStrands will notify you by electronic mail using the e-mail address you have provided.  You are responsible for ensuring that your contact information is current and correct.  To review or change your contact information, go to the "My Profile" page on the Web Site.

        If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as email), we provide a way to correct and update users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the "My Profile" page.
    </p>

    <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
    <p>
        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email and by posting a notice on the Web Site for 30 days.
    </p>
