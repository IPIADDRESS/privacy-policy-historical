    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>

        MediaStrands and its affiliate companies (MyStrands) respect your general interests in protecting your privacy. We endeavor to offer end users of our website and affiliated demonstration and software products a set of services at low or no charge in exchange for the rights to use but not abuse information about end users. In this document we identify the uses to which we may put information about end users. We also identify firm limits on those uses.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
        Information about users and user preferences are collected via the MyStrands and partyStrands website, web services that communicate with the website (the "Web Site"), and the MyStrands client. MyStrands is the sole owner of all information collected via its products. In order to use certain parts of the Web Site or the MyStrands client, users must first complete the registration form. During registration users are required to give contact information - most of this contact information is optional; only a valid email address is required to successfully register.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Use</h2>

        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>
            Information about users and user preferences are collected via the Web Site. MyStrands is the sole owner of all information collected via the Web Site. MyStrands collects information from users at several different points on the Web Site. MyStrands reserves the right to use information about users and users preference for demonstration purposes on other public and test websites. In order to use certain parts of the Web Site, users must first complete the registration form. During registration users are required to give contact information - most of this contact information is optional; only a valid email address is required to successfully register.

        </p>

        <h3>MyStrands</h3>
        <p>
            Play stream data includes information on songs a user is playing. MyStrands uses this data to power its recommendation engine, there by giving users a better personalized experience. Aggregate statistics of this data is viewable in the user profile on the MyStrands website and such data may be provided in affiliated and demonstration web site.

        </p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            A cookie is a set of data stored on the user´s computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. By setting a cookie on the Web Site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the Web Site. If a user rejects the cookie, the user may still use the Web Site, but the user will be limited in some areas of the Web Site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and foster the interests of our users to enhance the experience on the Web Site.

        </p>

        <h3>Log Files</h3>
        <p>
            Most standard web site servers use log files, and so do we. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

        </p>
        <h3> Cell Phones</h3>
        <p>
        If you access our service via cell phone, MyStrands stores the SMS/MMS content as well as information relayed to us by third party providers such as encrypted cell phone numbers, the time the message was sent and the name of the mobile operator.
        </p>
    <h2>Communications from the Site Customer Service</h2>
    <p>
        We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account.

    </p>

        <h3>Service Announcements</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. These communications are not promotional in nature.

        </p>

    <h2>Special Offers</h2>
    <p>
        Members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, users will be presented with an option to not receive these communications prior to the first such electronic mailing. Your response will apply to any subsequent mailings until you elect to change your preferences.

    </p>

    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>
        New members receive a welcoming email to verify password and username. Users may also receive emails regarding changes in MyStrands functionality and policies.

    </p>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>

        <h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
            Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on the Web Site.

        </p>

        <h3>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3>

        <p>
            We reserve the right to share aggregated demographic information and user preferences with third parties and in public demonstrations. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

        </p>

        <h3>Third Party Advertisers</h3>
        <p>
            MyStrands reserves the right to share Web Site usage information about users with a reputable third party advertiser for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on this site and other sites.

        </p>

        <h3>Business Transitions</h3>

        <p>
            In the event MyStrands goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

        </p>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
        This Web Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, MyStrands, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Web Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web Site.

    </p>

    <h2>Sharing Playlists</h2>

    <p>
        If a registered user elects to use our "Share my profile" feature, we ask them for an Screen Name. Subsequently, their playlists will be available to the entire registered community but only in association with the user-supplied Screen Name. The registered user may deselect this feature at any time.

    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        MyStrands takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web Site, their information is protected both online and off-line. All users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is subject to restricted access in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility. If users have any questions about the security at the Web Site, users can send an email to <a href="mailto:info@MyStrands.com">info@MyStrands.com</a>.

    </p>

    <h2>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
        If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as email), we provide a way to correct and update users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the "My Profile" page.

    </p>

    <h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
    <p>
        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email and by posting a notice on the Web Site for 30 days.

    </p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>

        If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at:
