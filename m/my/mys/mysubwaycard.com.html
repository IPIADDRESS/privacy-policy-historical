            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Personal Information is defined as any 
            information concerning an identified or identifiable individual. An 
            identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or 
            indirectly, by reference to an identification number or to one or 
            more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, 
            economic, cultural or social identity. Personal Information shall 
            include but is not limited to: Social Security Number, social 
            insurance number, name, address, telephone number, financial 
            information and similar identifying information. Other than 
            financial information (which is collected only as indicated below), 
            IPC will never collect "sensitive" Personal Information such as 
            information pertaining to racial or ethnic origins, political or 
            religious beliefs, health, and sexual orientation. </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">What Personal Information We Collect 
            from Franchisees </font></b></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">IPC collects and uses Personal 
            Information in order to provide services to you as a SUBWAYÂ® 
            restaurant franchisee. IPC will collect your Personal Information in 
            a fair and non-intrusive manner, with your voluntary consent. 
            Personal Information collected from franchise owners includes but is 
            not limited to: your name, birth date, address, telephone number, 
            facsimile number, email address, password, and taxpayer 
            identification number. IPC will also collect store name, address, 
            bank account information for Electronic Funds Transfer, credit card 
            information, social security numbers and/or social insurance 
            numbers, and other related information necessary for billing 
            purposes, such as mailing address for credit card validation. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">IPC may collect this information from you 
            directly or IPC may receive it from Doctor's Associates Inc. 
            ("DAI"). For example, in order to implement the SUBWAYÂ® Cash Card 
            and Rewards Card Programs, IPC must have access to a franchisee's 
            Personal Information, including, but not limited to: name, address, 
            and the bank account information that you provided to DAI to 
            establish your pre-authorized account for the payment of royalties, 
            advertising fees, and other charges. If a franchisee does not wish 
            to disclose this information, it must notify the Privacy Officer in 
            writing as described in the section titled Contact Information 
            below. Failure to provide requested Personal Information may 
            negatively impact your ability to operate as a franchisee or to 
            participate in certain programs that may be mandatory for 
            franchisees. </font></p>

            SUBWAYÂ® Rewards Cards and SUBWAYÂ® Cash Cards may voluntarily 
            register their cards through the SUBWAYÂ® Card web site, administered 
            by IPC. To register your Card, you may be asked to provide Personal 
            Information including, but not limited to: date of birth, card 
            number, and e-mail address. YOU MUST BE 13 YEARS OLD OR OLDER TO

            or from selected third parties, i.e., suppliers of products offered 
            through the SUBWAYÂ® system whose offers IPC will forward to you. If
