<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Independent Purchasing Cooperative, Inc. ( « IPC » ), a cooperative comprised of SUBWAY® Franchisees and its wholly owned subsidiary Value Pay Services LLC. ( « VPS » ) (collectively referred to as "IPC") recognizes the valuable need to protect the information gathered from our franchisees, potential franchisees, customers, and visitors.  For this reason, IPC has implemented a Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all information gathered through any web site operated by or on behalf of IPC.  By using these web sites, or participating in any program or service managed by IPC, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.  If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the protection of your Personal Information, please contact us through our web site at www.ipcoop.com or directly, or as outlined below in the Section entitled Contact Information.  </p>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<p>IPC will update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When IPC posts changes to this Privacy Policy, we also will revise the "last updated" date on the Privacy Policy. If there are material changes to this Privacy Policy, IPC will notify you by placing prominent notice on the Web site. IPC encourages you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to be informed of how IPC is protecting your information and to be aware of any changes to the Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into any Terms of Use governing the various web sites and any programs or services operated or managed on or behalf of IPC.  Any changes to this Privacy Policy are effective immediately after being posted by IPC.</p>
<h3>User Name and Password</h3>
<p>In order to access the member or non-public pages on web sites operated by IPC, you must create a user name and password.  IPC does not divulge user names or passwords to anyone internal or external to IPC.  Should you need to need to change or remove your user name or password, contact us through the web site form posted on www.ipcoop.com or directly as further outlined below. </p>
<h3>What Is Personal Information?</h3>
<p>Personal Information is defined as any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. Personal Information shall include but is not limited to: Social Security Number, name, address, telephone number, financial statement and similar identifying information. </p>
<p>IPC will never collect Sensitive Personal Information. Sensitive Personal Information shall include but is not limited to: information pertaining to racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, health, and sexual orientation. </p>
<h3>What Personal Information We Collect from Franchisees </h3>
<p>IPC collects and uses Personal Information in order to provide services to you as a SUBWAY® restaurant franchisee. IPC will collect your Personal Information in a fair and non-intrusive manner, with your voluntary consent.  Personal Information collected from franchise owners includes but is not limited to: your name, birth date, address, telephone number, facsimile number, email address, password, and taxpayer identification number.  IPC will also collect store name, address, bank account information for Electronic Funds Transfer, credit card information, social security numbers, and other related information necessary for billing purposes, such as mailing address for credit card validation.  </p>
<p>IPC may collect this information from you directly or IPC may receive it from Doctor's Associates Inc. ( « DAI » ). For example, in order to implement the SUBWAY® Cash Card and Rewards Card Programs, IPC must have access to a franchisee's Personal Information, including, but not limited to: name, address, and the bank account information that you provided to DAI to establish your pre-authorized account for the payment of royalties, advertising fees, and other charges.  If a franchisee does not wish to disclose this information, it must notify the Privacy Officer at DAI, or, if collected by IPC, the Privacy Officer at IPC,  in writing as described in the section titled Contact Information below.  Failure to provide requested Personal Information may negatively impact your ability to operate as a franchisee or to participate in certain programs that may be mandatory for franchisees.  </p>
<h3>What Personal Information We Collect from Customers</h3>
<p>IPC will not collect customer Personal Information unless the customer contacts IPC directly. Holders of SUBWAY® Rewards Cards and SUBWAY® Cash Cards may voluntarily register their cards through the SUBWAY® Card web site, administered by IPC. To register your Card, you may be asked to provide Personal Information including, but not limited to: date of birth, card number, and e-mail address. YOU MUST BE 13 YEARS OLD OR OLDER TO REGISTER A SUBWAY® CARD. Your purchase history may also be linked to this information. IPC uses this information as part of its Lost/Stolen Card Program and to provide you with targeted offers, from the SUBWAY®  restaurants that you dine at, or from selected third parties, i.e., suppliers of products offered through the SUBWAY®  system whose offers IPC will forward to you. If you do not wish to receive promotional materials with your use of the SUBWAY®  Card, you may update your preferences at <a href="http://www.mysubwaycard.com/">www.mysubwaycard.com</a>.</p>
<h3>How We Use Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>IPC may use your Personal Information to operate its various web sites, to implement and administer the Cash Card and Rewards Card Program, to fulfill purchases by you, to provide any other services you have requested, such as subscription requests by you for The Link or other IPC publications, to address quality complaints that you submit, and to provide online equipment valuation services.  Your Personal Information also may be used to communicate with you regarding your account(s) with IPC.  </p>
<p>We also may use your e-mail address to respond to incoming service and support requests from you, to collect franchisee feedback, to conduct franchisee satisfaction surveys, to offer promotions to you, and to send other service informational mailings. Your Personal Information may be provided to a courier or freight forwarder in order to fulfill an order you may have requested from IPC. </p>
<h3>Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, IPC will not share your Personal Information with a third party, unless you request or otherwise consent to such disclosure or disclosure is required or authorized by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on IPC or its web sites; (b) protect or defend the rights or property of IPC, its web sites or its web site users or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of IPC, its web sites or the public. </p>
<p>IPC also reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer Personal Information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, or financing of all or any portion of IPC or of any of the business or assets or shares of IPC or a division thereof in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party.</p>
<h3>Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Personal Information may be shared with IPC affiliates pursuant to the service contracts between them to better service franchise owners.  However, any affiliates with whom your Personal Information is shared will be subject to agreements to maintain the confidentiality and security of your Personal Information. </p>
<p>IPC may share and exchange Personal Information in order to administer and implement the SUBWAY® Cash Card and Rewards Card program, and to service your franchisee needs and related administrative functions.</p>
<h3>Internet Protocol (IP) Address</h3>
<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) Address is associated with your computer's connection to the Internet. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site and to maintain contact with you as you navigate through our web site.  Your computer's IP address also may be used to provide you with personalized content.  Your computer's IP address by itself does not identify you personally. </p>
<h3>Aggregate Information</h3>
<p>To measure our visitors' interest in and use of various areas of our web site and the various programs that we administer, we will rely upon aggregate information, which is information that does not identify you, such as statistical and navigational information. With this aggregate information, we may undertake statistical and other summary analyses of our visitors' behavior and characteristics.  Although we may share this aggregate information with third parties, none of this information will allow anyone to identify you, or to determine anything else personal about you.</p>
<p>IPC also collects information in aggregate that is not considered personal concerning the food items purchased and the demographics of the purchasers. IPC may share this information with DAI and its affiliates to improve product marketing and advertising. </p>
<h3>Supplemental Information</h3>
<p>We may supplement the information that you provide us with information that is received from third parties. </p>
<h3>Storage of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>IPC uses commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Personal Information is safeguarded against loss, access, use, modification, disclosure, or other misuse. All reasonable steps are taken to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information. Personally identifiable information collected by IPC may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which IPC or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  </p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We take seriously the security of all personal and non-personal information associated with our franchisees, customers and visitors.   We use the encryption process Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to secure transmission of your order.  Only those IPC employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are allowed access.  </p>
<h3>Retention of Personal Information</h3>
<p>IPC will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws, and your consent to such purposes(s) remains valid after termination of our relationship with you.</p>
<h3>Accuracy of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We take all reasonable steps to insure that your Personal Information is accurate, up-to-date, complete, relevant and not misleading.</p>
