  <h2>Effective: May 20, 2014</h2>
</header>

<div class="card padded">
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used and disclosed by Limelight Corp. with respect to your access and use of our services. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to any websites, services or applications operated or provided by other companies that can be accessed through our services.</p>

  <p>Any information that is collected is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise our Privacy Policy from time-to-time. If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you of those changes by posting them on our website, through our services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we will indicate when those changes will become effective. By continuing to access or use our services after those changes become effective, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised policy.</p>

  <p><b>Information You Provide</b></p>
  <p>We will collect personal information from you (like your name and email address) when you register for an account. If you create an account using your login from another online account (like Facebook), we will access and collect the information about you that you choose to share (which is based on the permissions you give) when you create your account with us.</p>

  <p>Note regarding children: We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are under 13, you may only use the Service with the involvement of your parent or legal guardian and using their account. If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Note regarding international users: Information that is provided to us will be transferred to and maintained on computers located in the United States (or any other country where we operate) and processed there – by providing us with your information, you are acknowledging and agreeing to that transfer.</p>

  <p><b>Information We Collect</b></p>
  <p>We collect certain information that your web browser sends when you visit our website, like the Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser, pages viewed, and other such information about your use of our services. We use “cookies” – small data files – to collect this information, which allows us to identify your browser and to improve your use of our services. You can set your web browser to refuse these cookies, however, some features of our services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.  </p>

  <p><b>Information Collected by Others</b></p>
  <p>We may enable other companies to collect usage analytics about our services.  These companies may place their own cookies on your device to collect traffic and activity data in order to deliver us relevant metrics and information. We do not share any personal information of our users with these companies, but we may share anonymous or aggregated information about our users with them to help improve our services.  The collection of this data by these companies is subject to their own privacy policy.  For more information visit: <a href="www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Analytics.</a></p>

  <p><b>How We Use the Information We Collect</b></p>
  <p>We use the information we collect to provide our services (or the information you request), to process and complete any transactions, to respond to inquiries, to personalize and improve our services and your experiences when you use our services, to monitor and analyze usage and trends of our services, to send you messages regarding the operation and use of our services, and for any other purpose for which the information was collected.</p>

  <p><b>Information We Share With Others</b></p>
  <p>We will share information about you when you instruct us to do so, such as if we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.</p>

  <p>We will share information about you if we are (or if we believe we are) required by law or legal process (such as a subpoena, warrant or court order), if we have to respond to a lawful request from legal authorities to disclose such information, or if we need to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or our other terms and policies.</p>

  <p>Your information may be accessed and used by our service providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of our services (these service providers may have access to your information but only to the extent necessary to perform services on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose that information or use it for any other purposes).</p>

  <p>We may share information about you in anonymous and/or aggregated form (that doesn’t identify someone individually) with other companies for usage analytics (to help us better understand who is using our services and how), to improve the relevancy of the content you see on our services (to tailor it to your interests) and for industry analysis, demographic profiling, research, and other similar purposes.  We may also transfer and/or provide information about our users in connection with an acquisition, sale of company assets, or other situation where user information would be transferred as one of our business assets.</p>

  <p><b>How to Access Your Information</b></p>
  <p>You can access and modify the information you provided us through your account.  If you completely delete all such information, then your account will become deactivated and you will no longer be able to access our services through your account.
