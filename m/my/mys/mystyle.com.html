    <p><span class="highlight">IP Address:</span> Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a unique identifier used to connect your computer to the Internet. Your IP address also is stored in E!'s user registration databases when you register with E!</p>

    <p>IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to:<br>

    </ul><p></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Cookies:</span> E! uses a feature of your Internet Web browser called a "cookie,"   a small piece of information stored on your hard drive that uniquely identifies your intra- and inter-requests on the Website. Cookies may be used for various purposes, including to keep track of preferences you specify while you are using E!'s services and the Website. E! allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of E!'s Website pages to set and access cookies on your computer. E! does not control cookies from third-party advertisers. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not the privacy policy of E! The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Web Beacons:</span> Web pages may contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel GIF" or "Web beacon") that allow a Website to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. E! uses Web beacons in the following ways:<br>
    </p><ul>
    <li>Within the E! network of Websites in order to count users and to recognize users by accessing E! cookies</li>
    <li>To personalize your experience when you visit the Website</li>
    </ul><p></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Mobile Device Unique Identifier:</span> E! provides services that allow users to access and customize Internet content through mobile phones, PDAs and other alternative devices. These devices may collect different information than what is collected by computers.<br>
    </p><ul>
    <li>When connecting to E! using a mobile device that provides Internet access, if the mobile device service provider uniquely identifies the device, E! will receive this information.</li>
    <li>E! may use this unique mobile device identification information to offer extended services and/or functionality.</li>
    <li>Certain E! services may require collection of the phone number for your device. E! may associate that phone number to the mobile device identification information.</li>
    </ul><p></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Physical Location</span>
    </p><ul>
    <li>Some mobile phone service providers in the United States are required to operate a system that will pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service.</li>
    <li>Depending on the provider and if you are located in the United States, E! may automatically receive this information.</li>
    <li>E! may use and store this information to provide enhanced location-based services as well as to serve location-targeted advertising.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Personal Information:</span> E! also receives and stores information that personally identifies you. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at the Website include: name, address, email address, phone number, fax number, billing address, shipping address, product selections, order number, referring URL, IP address, password, username, how you got to know about the Website, gender, occupation, personal interests, your age and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs and services. You voluntarily provide this personally identifiable information when you enter it on the Website to sign up as a member of E!, whether in connection with a newsletter subscription, when you enter a sweepstakes, promotion or contest  and/or other special benefits.</p>

    <p>At the Website, you can submit personally identifiable information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and email address to send an electronic greeting card or to email an E! news story and, if you are located in the United States, order a gift on the Website and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected and stored about other people at the Website include: recipient's name, address, email address  and telephone number. E! does not share with, rent, transfer or sell personally identifiable information that you submit about other people to any third parties or nonaffiliated entities.</p>

    <p>If you are located in the United States and make a purchase on the Website, E! will collect and store your personally identifiable information. When processing an order on the Website, E! needs to know your name, mailing address, billing address, email address, telephone number, product selection, order number, credit card number and expiration date. This information is necessary to process your order and to keep you updated on your shipping status. Although E! transmits your credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, E! <i>does not</i> rent, transfer, sell  or share your credit card issuer, credit card number or expiration date with any nonaffiliated entities.</p>

    <p>With respect to unsolicited telephone calls made to E!, if you make a call to an E! telephone number provided by E! via the Website (or any other means) ("Unsolicited Telephone Call"), E! may collect and store your personally identifiable information.  E! <i>does not</i> knowingly share with, rent, transfer or sell personally identifiable information that you submit about other people to any third parties or nonaffiliated entities.  In the event you make an Unsolicited Telephone Call, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) all local and/or long distance toll charges that may apply are your sole responsibility; (ii) you knowingly and voluntarily assume all risks associated with such Unsolicited Telephone Call; (iii) you will not harass, abuse, or threaten any E! employee, contractor, agent or representative; (iv) you will not deliver any unauthorized or unsolicited, advertising or promotional materials or solicitations; (v) you will not make an Unauthorized Telephone Call using any type of automated dialing system; (vi) you will not attempt to interfere, disrupt, or adversely affect or impact E!; (vii) you will not make any misrepresentations, commit or perpetrate any fraud with regard to your name, the purpose of your call, your telephone number and/or email address, or any other information or disclosures made by you at any time during the course of your Unsolicited Telephone Call; (viii) you are 18 years of age or older; (ix) if you are a resident of the State of Alabama or Nebraska, you are 19 years of age or older; and (x) if you are a resident of the State of Mississippi or Pennsylvania, you are 21 years of age or older.  Your Unsolicited Telephone Call is expressly conditioned on your acceptance and agreement that your Unsolicited Telephone Call may be monitored and/or recorded at any time for quality control purposes.  In the event you provide E! with your telephone number by making an Unsolicited Telephone Call and/or by interacting with the Website (i.e., submitting your personal information in order to be considered to appear and/or participate in an E! or style network television program), then you expressly consent and give permission to E! to contact you via telephone ("Return Telephone Call").  You expressly acknowledge and agree that such Return Telephone Call is made by E! with your express consent and agreement  and shall not be in violation of any local, state, federal or international "Do Not Call" statutes, regulations, codes or laws, or any similar law in any country of the world.</p>

    <p><strong>Does E! Ever Share Information with Other Parties?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Disclosure of Information to Outside Parties:</strong> E! may disclose information about you (except your credit card number and its expiration date, personally identifiable information that you submit about other people and as described below) to those whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy in the following circumstances including, but not limited to:<br>
    </p><ul>
    <li>E! provides the information to trusted partners who work with E!.

    <li>E! displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view  or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria (for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area).</li>
    <li>By interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.</li>
    <li>E! <i>does not</i> share with, rent, transfer or sell to any nonaffiliated entities information, such as your cover letter, salary history, requirements  or   résumé, that you submit to E! through <a href="http://www.eentertainment.com">http://www.eentertainment.com</a> in connection with your job application, which will be considered only if you are eligible to be employed in the United States.</li>
    </ul><p></p>

    <p>For instructions on how to opt out from such disclosures, please <a href="/account/opt/index.jsp">click here</a>.</p>

    <p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, E! cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

    <p><strong>Links to Outside Third Parties:</strong> E! may establish relationships with business partners by creating a link between their sites and the Website. E! is not, however, responsible for the content, maintenance or privacy policies of those sites. Once you click over to a third party site, E! encourages you to check its privacy policy.</p>

    <p>The Website may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than the information practices of E!
