<b>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We take appropriate
security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural
measures) to help safeguard your personal information from
unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized
employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may
do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use
encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information
between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent
unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal
information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>However, no
system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to
secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not
expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.
Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their
personal information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission<font face="Verdana, serif">′</font>s
