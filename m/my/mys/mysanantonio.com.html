We may also use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you, to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the information that we have collected, or respond to your comments and suggestions.
</p><p>
The Partners may match specific and/or aggregated Personal Information with third party data to provide you with product and content offerings that interest you and improve our advertising and marketing efforts. The Partners also may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to potential advertisers, partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, and for other lawful purposes.
</p><p>
As part of your experience on our Site, you may receive communications from us related to products and services that might interest you. While we believe these services will enhance your experience at our Site, you will at all times be able to opt out from receiving these communications, either by specifically opting out of these services or by deleting your profile from our database. Please refer to "Opting-Out" for further reference.
</p><p>
We have today, and will in the future have, arrangements with third party service providers, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment services. When you sign up for a service we offer on the Site, we may be required to share Personal Information with that service provider in order to provide the service. These third party providers are required to comply with this policy and protect your information in the same way we do. They are not permitted to retain or use Personal Information for any purpose unrelated to providing the service.
</p><p>
The Partners may also offer other services as a part of our Site (e.g., car buying service, personalized finance and weather information alerts, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions with unaffiliated third parties). If you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some of your Personal Information to these parties. We will not do so without telling you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the Site. Some of these third parties may also collect their own Personal Information in connection with providing the service. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy for that portion of the Site prior to disclosing Personal Information. Please refer to "Party Collecting the Information" for further reference.
</p><p>
When you subscribe online to receive home delivery of the San Antonio Express-News (“EN”), that information will be transferred to the EN and will become a part of the subscriber database maintained by the EN. The information will be used to fulfill your subscription (and may be shared with third parties for that purpose) and to contact you about your subscription. The EN may also share that information with its affiliated newspapers, and use it to contact you, or authorize carefully selected third party marketers to contact you, with offers that it believes may be of interest.
</p><p>
Any orders you place on the Express News Online Store will also be transferred to the EN. The EN, and third party service providers used on its behalf, will use that information solely to process, fulfill and deliver your order.
</p><p>
We may provide Personal Information to our affiliated companies in order to improve our marketing and advertising efforts and your experience with our Site. Although this Privacy Policy generally applies only to the Partners, and not to activities or information collected by our offline partners, in the event we share Personal Information you provide us on the Site, we will require that our affiliated companies comply with this policy with respect to that information and protect your information in the same way we do.
</p><p>
We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information when needed to comply with the law or a legal process, cooperate with investigations of purported unlawful activities, to identify persons violating the law, or in connection with the sale of part or all of either of the Partners or its respective affiliate's stock or assets.

<br><br>

<span class="regheader_lg">Party Collecting the Information</span>
</p><p>
This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose any information to other parties, whether through, for example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, personal ads, or the like, through third party services or promotions offered on or through the Site or through other web sites throughout the Internet, different policies may apply and Mysa.com shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of such information.
</p><p>
The Site may offer forums, message boards, or chat rooms as one of the services on the Site. If you disclose personal information in one of these forums, this information can be viewed, collected, and used by others. Mysa.com is not responsible for the use of information you disclose in these forums. We encourage you to consult the Forum Rules regarding the policies and procedures that apply to that portion of the Site.
</p><p>
Our Site may operate as part of a larger group of sites, and may carry co-branded pages. In addition, other sites may use the Site's or a Partner’s name. Since the Partners do not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of such third parties, and the Partners shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your private information by such parties. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review those parties' privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information to others.

<span class="regheader_lg">Children's Privacy</span>

MySA.com cares about the safety of children and their use of the Internet. Therefore, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. In the event that we receive actual knowledge that we have collected such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practical.

<br><br>

<span class="regheader_lg">Opting-Out</span>
</p><p>
We respect your privacy and ability to choose whether to share information with us and any third party. You may choose to "opt-out" of sharing Personal Information in several ways. When choosing to use certain features or services on the Site, you can choose whether to share optional Personal Information in connection with the feature or service. If you receive communications from us that you prefer not to receive, you may opt out from receiving these communications, by modifying the contact options in your registration profile.

</p><p>
When any site user chooses to opt-out of a specific advertiser program, to comply with federal law, we will furnish that user’s e-mail address to only the affected advertiser and only for the purpose of ensuring that address is removed from the advertiser’s own distribution lists per the user’s opt-out request.

California and Canadian residents have the right to know how their information may be shared with third parties who engage in direct marketing activities and this policy explains our practices and how you can opt out of having your information shared for such purposes. From time to time we may make our customer lists available to companies that sell goods and services that we believe would be of interest. We may compile these lists from customer orders placed both offline and online. Customers have the option of having their names and identifying information removed from those lists (subject to certain exceptions and limitations in applicable laws) by contacting us at [specify email address and link].
</p><p>
We may also from time to time make our customer lists available for direct marketing purposes to other entities (other than the partners) that are affiliated with us. If you would like to be removed from those lists, contact us at [specify email address and link].
