    <p><strong>2.&nbsp;  Web Site Usage Information</strong> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>(i) Cookies</strong> <br>
        We  may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.&nbsp; Cookies are small data files that are sent to  your browser or related software from a Web server when you visit it and are stored  on your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes.&nbsp; Cookies track where you travel on our Web  Site and what you look at and purchase.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;They may store the information in your  shopping cart, and/or your username and password.&nbsp; A cookie may enable us to relate your use of  our Web Site to other information about you, including your Personal  Information.&nbsp; These purposes serve to  improve and personalize your experience on our Web Site.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
      <p>You  may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the internet  industry.&nbsp; We do not control these  cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our privacy policies.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Most  Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and  provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.&nbsp; Additionally, if you have a Flash player  installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete  Flash cookies.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>However, refusing  a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the  display or function of, the Web Site or certain areas or features of the Web  Site.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>(ii) Clear GIFs&nbsp; </strong><br>
        We  may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar  technologies, in the Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us  to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message.&nbsp; A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel,  transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web  page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote  site on the internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or  receipt of a web page or message.&nbsp; A  clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or  message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>(iii)  IP Address and Clickstream Data</strong><br>
        Aggregated  information, such as which pages users access or visit and information  volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or Web Site registrations,  is collected through various methods.&nbsp;  For example, our server may automatically collect data about your  server’s internet address when you visit us.&nbsp;  This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address,  is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet  service provider whenever you’re on the internet.&nbsp; When you request pages from our Web Site, our  servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.&nbsp; Our server may also record the referring page  that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you  visit on this Web Site; the web site you visit after this Web Site; the ads you  see; the ads you click on; other information about the type of web browser,  computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search  terms you have entered on this Web Site or a referral site; and other web usage  activity and data logged by our web servers.&nbsp;  We use this information for internal system administration, to help  diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site.&nbsp; Such information may also be used to gather  broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider.&nbsp; We may also link this information with your  Personal Information when we feel that it is necessary to enforce compliance  with our rules and policies or Terms of Use or to protect our Web Site,  customers or others.</p>
      <p>Any  or all of these activities with regard to Web Site usage information may be  performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1. &nbsp;General </strong><br>
      No  transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely  secure.&nbsp; It may be possible for third  parties not under the control of the Partners to intercept or access  transmissions or private communications unlawfully, including in the case of  your contacting us by e-mail or a “contact us” or similar feature on our Web  Site.&nbsp; Accordingly, though the Partners may  take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal  Information provided to this Web Site, due to the inherent nature of the internet  as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information,  during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or  otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such  as hackers.&nbsp; Any such transmission is  done at your own risk.</p>
    <p>You may be able to create an account on our Web Site with a username  and password.&nbsp; If so, you are responsible  for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you  shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Web Site by you or any  person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has  been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or  entity is your employee or agent.&nbsp; You  agree to (a) immediately notify the Partners of any unauthorized use of your  password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you  exit from your account at the end of each session.&nbsp; It is your sole responsibility to control the  dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your  account, and notify the Partners when you desire to cancel your account on this  Web Site.&nbsp; We will not be responsible or  liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this  provision.</p>
    <p>We  will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or  unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.</p>
    <p>In  the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal  Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek  to notify you of that development.&nbsp; If a  notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible  under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may  notify you by e-mail or by other means as required by law.&nbsp; <strong>You consent to our use of e-mail as a  means of such notification.</strong>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Phishing<br>
  </strong>With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly  common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers,  purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line  merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive  information.&nbsp; Sometimes, the domain name  of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the  domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the  domain name of a legitimate, trusted company.&nbsp;  In reality, such sensitive information may be collected by an  unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal  activity has come to be known as "phishing." </p>
    <p>If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you  provide any sensitive information (including your Web Site password or credit  card information) via e-mail or to a web site that does not seem to be affiliated  with our Web Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not  provide such information, and report such request to us at <strong><a href="mailto:webmaster@mysanantonio.com">webmaster@mysanantonio.com</a>.</strong>&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
