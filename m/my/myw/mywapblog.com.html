  <h2>Privacy Policy for MyWapBlog.com</h2>
<p>The privacy of our visitors to MyWapBlog.com is important to us.</p>
<p>At MyWapBlog.com, we recognize that privacy of your  personal information is important. Here is information on what types of  personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit  MyWapBlog.com, and how we safeguard your information.&nbsp;  We never sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong><br>
  As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in  log files.&nbsp; The information in the log files include&nbsp; your IP (internet  protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or  Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet  Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you  visited throughout our site.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong><br>
  We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal  preferences when you visit our site.&nbsp; This could include only showing  you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our  features, such as forums.</p>
<p>We also use third party advertisements on MyWapBlog.com to support our site.&nbsp; Some of these advertisers may use  technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our  site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through  the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your  ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases,  whether you have Flash installed.&nbsp; This is generally used for  geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in  New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites  visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking  sites).</p>
<p><strong>DoubleClick DART cookies</strong><br>
  We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's  DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are  browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising  (including some Google AdSense advertisements).&nbsp; This cookie is used to  serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based  targeting”).&nbsp; The ads served will be targeted based on your previous  browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about  visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when  viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey).&nbsp; DART uses  “non personally identifiable information”.&nbsp; It does NOT track personal  information about you, such as your name, email address, physical  address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account  numbers or credit card numbers.&nbsp; You can opt-out of this ad serving on  all sites using this advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or  third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing  preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; However,  this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as  other websites.&nbsp; This could include the inability to login to services  or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>
<p>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any  advertising program.&nbsp; Unless you have settings that disallow cookies,  the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie  will be added.</p>
