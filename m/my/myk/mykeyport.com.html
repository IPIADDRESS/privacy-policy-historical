        <p class="style15">Web Site Use Information </p>
        <p>Similar to other commercial websites, Keyport utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used.  Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent on our site, and the website visited just before and just after visiting our website. </p>
        <h2>Cookies </h2>
        <p>A “cookie” is a small text file that a Web site can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it easier to use certain site functions. The cookie transmits this information back to the Web site's computer. Many users do not know that "cookies" are being placed on their computers when they visit Web sites. If you want to know when this happens, or prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a Web site attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer. </p>
        <p>Cookies allow you to place an order on our website and allow us to enhance and personalize your online surfing and shopping experience. For example, we use cookies to:</p>
        <p>·       Remember the items in your shopping basket</p>
        <p>·       Recognize you when you return to our website</p>
        <p>·       Analyze visitor behavior </p>
        <h2>Web Site Analytics </h2>
        <p>We also use cookies to analyze how visitors, in the aggregate, use our website, in order to make our website as useful as possible for them. We do not use cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information. We may also use a third party web analytics service provider that uses cookies and web beacons to help us analyze how users use this website and the effectiveness of our marketing search terms. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including, without limitation, your IP address) may be transmitted to and stored by this service provider. They may use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website and compiling aggregated reports for us.  The information collected by our service provider and provided to us is not personally identifiable. </p>
        <h2>Information Automatically Collected by Our Website </h2>
        <p>Our servers automatically collect certain non-personally identifying information, such as your computer’s IP address, the type of browser in use, and pages viewed, when you visit our Sites. We use this information to understand how visitors navigate through our website, to enhance your experience while using our website, and to make the materials we post as valuable to visitors as possible. We do not link this information to personally identifiable information. </p>
        <h2>Third Parties </h2>
        <p>We may choose to work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the internet. These companies may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our website and your interaction with our communications, including advertising. </p>
        <p>We may also enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide certain information to third parties if we have determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party. For example, some of our partners operate stores or provide services on our site, while others power offerings developed by us for your use. We also use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card payments. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to your personal information for use in connection with business activities. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution. </p>
        <h2>Certain Disclosures </h2>
        <p>We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or affiliated parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, our site, the users of our site, and/or our affiliated parties; (c) act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of our site, us, or third parties. </p>
        <h2>Linked Websites </h2>
        <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site. </p>
        <p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. </p>
        <h2>Consent </h2>
        <p>By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. </p>
        <p class="style15">Updates to Privacy Information </p>
