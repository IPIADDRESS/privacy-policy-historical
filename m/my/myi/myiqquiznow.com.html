        <p>"Cookies" are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, 
          cookies may store small amounts of data on your computer about your 
          visit to any of the Sites. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our 
          features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed 
          on past visits. When you visit the Sites again, cookies can enable us 
          to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies 
          to: keep track of the number of return visits to the Sites; accumulate 
          and report aggregate, statistical information on websites usage; deliver 
          specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; 
          save your password for ease of access to our Sites. You can disable 
          cookies, although the Sites may not function properly for you. Your

          <strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
        <p> We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior 
          on the Sites. We may use this information to do internal research on 
          our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, 
          protect and serve you and our community. This information may include 
          the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the Sites or 
          not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the Sites or 
          not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet 
          Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which 
          is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). 
          For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, 
          an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. 
          IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information 
          about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify 
          an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used 
          to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address 
          can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or 
          which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, 
          and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.

          experience of our visitors. For instance, NationalTelephoneAdvisory.com
