            Your privacy is important to STACOS. This statement discloses the information practices
            for STACOS Web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked,
            how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared.</font></b></p>

    <p>
        <font size="2"><b>Personal information </b>
            <br>
            In general, you can visit STACOS<b> </b>on the Internet without telling us who you
            are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times,
            however, when we or our partners may need information from you.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font size="2">You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations.
            For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address
            or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with
            a subscription. You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us
            or a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job
            opening at <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>that you wish to be considered for. We intend to
            let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if
            you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact
            with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give
            us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague,
            we will assume that you have their permission to do so.</font></p>

            <b>Using and Sharing Personal Information </b>
            <br>
            The following paragraphs describe in more detail how <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>may use
            your personal information and with whom we may share it. Depending on the type of
            <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>Web site you are visiting, one or more of the paragraphs may
            apply. For example, if you order a product from an <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>Web site,
            your information will be handled as described in such paragraphs as Fulfilling Your
            Transaction Request and Marketing Use.</font></p>

            <br>
            <b>Fulfilling your transaction request </b>
            <br>
            If you request something from an <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>Web site, for example, a product
            or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information
            you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information,
            with others, for instance, other parts of <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>, <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>
            Associates, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities
            (for example, Income tax authorities) involved in fulfillment. In connection with
            a transaction we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys
            or for market research purposes.</font></p>

    <p>
        <font size="2"><b>Marketing Use </b>

            The information you provide to <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>on certain <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>
            Web sites may also be used by <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>and selected third parties for
            marketing purposes. Before we use it, however, we will offer you the opportunity
            to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way. You can opt

        <font size="2"><b>STACOS<b> </b>Discussion Forums and Chat Rooms </b>
            <br>
            If you participate in an <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>discussion forum or chat room, you
            should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available
            to others, potentially inside or outside <b>STACOS,<b> </b></b>who have access to

            In some cases, specific <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>Web sites may contain other notices

            <b>Information Security and Quality </b>
            <br>
            We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement
            appropriate measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting certain
            sensitive information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain

            <b>Supplementing Information </b>

            From time to time we may supplement information you give us via an <b>STACOS<b> </b>
            </b>Web site with information from other sources, such as information validating
            your address or other available information about businesses. This is to help us
            maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better
            service.</font></p>

    <p>
        <font size="2"><b>Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies </b>
            <br>
            We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to
            help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains
            from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>
            Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This
            information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>or others
            on <b>STACOS's<b> </b></b>behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics
            and to help us provide better customer service.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font size="2">Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may
            extract some information about that transaction in an non-identifiable format and
            combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This
            information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand
            trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If
            you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your
            cookies.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font size="2">We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through
            the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece
            of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your
            computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some <b>STACOS<b>
            </b></b>pages use cookies, sent by <b>STACOS<b> </b></b>or its third party vendors,
            or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can
            set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance
            to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies.
            If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.</font></p>

            Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you. Please
            be aware that it is <b>STACOS</b>'s general practice to monitor and in some cases
            record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.</font></p>

            <b>Online Advertising </b>
            <br>
            Certain companies help us deliver interactive on-line advertising such as banner
            ads. These companies may collect and use information about customers to help us
            better understand the offers, promotions, and types of advertising that are most
            appealing to our customers. </font>

            On occasion, we may personalize and customize Web sites for certain visitors. If
            you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products
            and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous

            While you are visiting these Web sites, we may collect information about your visit
            to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these
            Web sites is usually presented as a personalized URL in an e-mail, a notice on a
            Web site registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain Web
            site.</font></p>
