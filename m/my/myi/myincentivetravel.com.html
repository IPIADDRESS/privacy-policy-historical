            	<p><strong>The following privacy statement details the MyIncentiveTravel.com pledge to keep your information private.</strong> Any questions in regards to MyIncentiveTravel.com privacy practices should be sent via email to <a href="mailto:privacy@myincentivetravel.com">privacy@myincentivetravel.com</a>.</p>
				<p>MyIncentiveTravel.com utilizes the cookie feature of your browser. Cookies, on their own, can't be used to identify you. The cookie feature of your browser can be turned off; simply locate your browser preference options. Keep in mind that disabling the cookie feature will prevent you from participating in certain activities.</p>
				<div class="subtitle">What type of information does MyIncentiveTravel.com collect?</div>
				<p>Your IP address helps MyIncentiveTravel.com diagnose server problems and helps us administer website functions. IP addresses provide us with geographical information and aggregated information on how visitors utilize MyIncentiveTravel.com. By monitoring search queries, access times, and traffic patterns we can determine how to market users and make their experience more enjoyable.</p>
				<div class="subtitle">What does MyIncentiveTravel.com do with my data?</div>
				<p>MyIncentiveTravel.com only collects data to enhance and personally tailor our website to meet your needs. Personal information that is collected allows us to customize website content and generate targeted advertisements based on your particular preferences. Cookies help us distinguish between individual users, tailor fit homepages, control advertisement frequency, and so on.</p>
				<p>IP addresses help us diagnose server issues and help us administer MyIncentiveTravel.com Without your IP address it would be impossible to keep our services running 24/7, and we want to be here for you around the clock.</p>
				<p>Every email sent to MyIncentiveTravel.com users is to meet your needs. We offer website updates, inform you of new features, allow you to register for special offers and sweepstakes, all for your enjoyment. If at any point these emails become annoying or bothersome, simply click on the link provided to opt out.</p>
				<p>Also note that your email address helps MyIncentiveTravel.com respond to any questions you have posed, issues you have encountered, or complaints made. We require your email address so we may address these issues.</p>
				<div class="subtitle">Who else gets to see my personal information?</div>
				<p>When you request services from our business partners MyIncentiveTravel.com will share your personal information with them, so that you can receive what you have requested. If you have any questions or concerns about an MyIncentiveTravel.com business partner, you may contact them directly. MyIncentiveTravel.com is not responsible for the data collection or privacy practices of business partners. Your personal information may also be shared with MyIncentiveTravel.com owned businesses.</p>
				<p>Targeted advertisements enhance user experience, and so at times we may share specifically non personal information with advertisers, so that they may present you with relevant advertisements. Geographical information may be shared along with demographics, but we will never share personally identifiable information.</p>
				<div class="subtitle">How do I delete my information from MyIncentiveTravel.com ?</div>
				<p>At this current time it is not possible to completely delete your user information from the MyIncentiveTravel.com database. If you are concerned with the security of your personal data you can remove the cookie stored on your browser, which will allow the server to perceive you as a new user. In the future you can change your browser setting to not accept cookies. Be aware that removing cookies does prevent you from participating in certain activities.</p>
				<div class="subtitle">Will I be notified of a security breach?</div>
				<p>MyIncentiveTravel.com has taken many steps to ensure that your personal information is not made publicly available and that is only accessible to the user who originally entered it. However, in the event of an unlikely security breach, the user will be notified via email immediately.</p>
				<div class="subtitle">Do linked sites honor your policy?</div>
				<p>Linked sites are not run or controlled by MyIncentiveTravel.com. The website does contain many linked sites, so that we may offer you additional services and products that we feel you will enjoy. Each linked site is owned by an outside company; therefore, they have established their own polices in respect to privacy. MyIncentiveTravel.com won't be held responsible for privacy practices or policies or content of linked sites. Also note that any personal information supplied to an outside advertiser is at your own risk.</p>
				<div class="subtitle">Will your policy always remain intact?</div>
				<p>We cannot guarantee that this policy will always be honored. In the event that MyIncentiveTravel.com is bought, or our assets are acquired by another company, user information may be transferred to new ownership. MyIncentiveTravel.com will suggest this policy be adapted, but we cannot guarantee it.</p>
				<div class="subtitle">MyIncentiveTravel.com will notify you of changes</div>
				<p>MyIncentiveTravel.com is constantly improving and making additions to our site to provide you with better features and services. As a result, our policies must be continuously revised. Whenever alterations are required, a new revised policy will be posted to this site, along with the date of last revision. It is important to us that you are always up to date with MyIncentiveTravel.com policies, so check this site often for information on your privacy.</p>
				<div class="subtitle">Contacting MyIncentiveTravel.com</div>
