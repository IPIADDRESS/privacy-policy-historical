                If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account and clicking on Settings (or Profile). 
                More information about how to contact us is provided below. If you have an online account with us, you also may delete or disable your account at any time by visiting the "Help" page. 
                If you delete or disable your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud,

                In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties'

                <h3>Your choices about collection and use of your information</h3>
                You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order 
                for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.
                <br><br>
                <h3>How we protect your personal information</h3>
                We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. 
                We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, 
                we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they 
                handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website for information 
                about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

                we require the user to provide evidence confirming that the user is at least 18 years old.  The users account is immediately suspended while waiting for such information.  If the user fails 
                to provide such information within 48 hours, we immediately terminate the user's account and nullify all personally identifiable information displaying on the site.

                <h3>Linked information</h3>
                Cookies: A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session 
                cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. 
                Cookies on our website do not link to or store your personal information.
                <br><br>
                For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. 
                We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any 
                usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie 
                will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing 
                analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.
                <br><br>
                We may allow third-parties, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect 
                information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information 
                about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of 
                advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information 
                with personal information they collect from you to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. The collection and use of that information 
                is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising 
                companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies and provides 
                information about this behavioral advertising practice (www.networkadvertising.org). This policy covers the use of cookies by MyInkedSpace
                only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
