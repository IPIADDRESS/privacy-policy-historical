                    There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an 
                    advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal 
                    information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party 
                    websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

                    If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account and clicking on Settings (or Profile). 
                    More information about how to contact us is provided below. If you have an online account with us, you also may delete or disable your account at any time by visiting the "Help" page. 
                    If you delete or disable your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, 
                    collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. 
                    In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' 
                    policies.

                    You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order

                    <br>
                    We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. 
                    We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, 
                    we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they 
                    handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website for information 
                    about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

                    about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of 
                    advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information

                    is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising 
                    companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies and provides
