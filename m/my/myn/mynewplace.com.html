<p>Effective April 24, 2006 (Update February 1, 2008)</p>
<p>Protecting the privacy of our users is very important to MyNewPlace. When you register at MyNewPlace.com, the information you provide to us is used to provide the services you have registered for, to deliver email notifications to you, and from time to time, to validate your identity. Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information you provide to us, and to control how we use that information. To find out more, please read on.</p>
<h3>Information Collection &amp; Use </h3>
<p>Multifamily Technology Solutions, Inc. wants your experience to be satisfying and safe. Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information you provide to us, and what MyNewPlace does with the information you supply. Your information will be kept within MyNewPlace unless you consent to our supplying all or a portion of your information to third parties as a part of one of our service offeringsMyNewPlace collects information online to allow you to use our services. Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address, contact phone number or other information related to of the property you are seeking. We request this information to deliver on the services you are requesting, and to allow us to provide our strongest value to you - a personalized online experience. Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that thousands of people have visited this Privacy Policy webpage, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from visits such as this constitutes anonymous information. Some of the individuals who access our services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the only data we collect about them is anonymous information.</li>
<li>Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, email address or phone number. While you can search and browse some sections of our web site without being a registered user, certain activities do require registration, such as viewing and saving properties. Registering with MyNewPlace will also cause a cookie to be issued; this cookie allows MyNewPlace to â€œrecognize" you when you are on our site to allow us to personalize our service for you.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Anonymous Information </h3>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<br>
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.<br>
We may link this automatically-collected data to Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
We use a third-party tracking service called WebSideStory that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. For information regarding WebSideStory's data collection and privacy practices, please visit <a href="http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html">http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html</a>.</p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information </h3>
<p>In order to use the basic features of this Web site, you need not register or provide any personal information. However, if you wish to save any properties you've located, view specific details of a property or contact a property for information, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address) as well as the time frame in which you intend to move. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. When you register with MyNewPlace, the information you provide to us is used to provide the service for which you have registered. Depending on the services you have chosen to use, some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information may be used by MyNewPlace to provide such services. Personally Identifiable Information may also be provided to intermediaries and third parties who assist MyNewPlace in providing you with the service you request. For example, if you register and desire to contact a property, some of your personally identifiable information may be shown to the property (e.g., contact information and time frame for moving). Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, however, MyNewPlace will not share, rent or sell your information to third parties without your permission.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible to receive cash back, you must also provide us with additional information about your new lease, such as monthly rent, length of lease and date of signing. In order to validate your eligibility for cash back offered by the property, we may disclose some of this Personally Identifiable Information to the property.</p>

<h3>Customer Service </h3>
<p>Based upon the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.

<h3>Profile </h3>
<p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, or clear gifs to create a profile of your preferences.

<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) </h3>
<p>We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.

<p>The ads appearing on this web site, if any, may be delivered to users by third-party advertising companies. Third-party advertising companies may use cookies and clear GIFs on this site, which allow it to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits this site. The companies serve their ads from their own web sites, independently from MyNewPlace. The information that the third-party advertising companies collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable, unless you provide such information in response to an advertisement.</p>
<h3>Links to Other Sites </h3>
<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by MyNewPlace. Please be aware that we, MyNewPlace, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.<br>

Please take care to store your Member Name separately from your account password, or better yet, choose a password that you don't need to write down at all.</p>
<h3>Business Transitions </h3>
<p>In the event MyNewPlace goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets as well as in the event of a bankruptcy, assignment for benefit of creditors or receivership, your personally identifiable information may be disclosed and will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
