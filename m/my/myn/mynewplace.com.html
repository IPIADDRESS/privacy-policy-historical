		<h1>MyNewPlace PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
			<div class="entrytext">
				<p> 			Effective April 24, 2006 		</p>
<p>  			Protecting the privacy of our users is very important to MyNewPlace. When you 			register at MyNewPlace, the information you provide to us is used to provide 			the services you have registered for, to deliver email notifications to you, 			and from time to time, to validate your identity. Our data collection policies 			allow you to choose how much information you provide to us, and to control how 			we use that information. To find out more, please read on. 		</p>
<h3> 			Information Collection &amp; Use 		</h3>
<p> 			MyNewPlace wants your experience to be satisfying and safe. Our data collection 			policies allow you to choose how much information you provide to us, and what 			MyNewPlace does with the information you supply. Your information will be kept 			within MyNewPlace unless you consent to our supplying all or a portion of your 			information to third parties as a part of one of our service offerings. 			However, if you tell MyNewPlace not to send you further emails, this 			instruction may be communicated to third parties who send email on MyNewPlace 			behalf solely to allow us to comply with your instructions. MyNewPlace collects 			information online to allow you to use our services. Depending on the service 			you are accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide information 			such as your name, email address, contact phone number or other information 			related to of the property you are seeking. We request this information to 			deliver on the services you are requesting, and to allow us to provide our 			strongest value to you - a personalized online experience. Information 			collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally 			identifiable:</p>
<p>  			1. Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a 			specific individual. For instance, we may know that thousands of people have 			visited this Privacy Policy webpage, but we do not necessarily know their 			names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from visits 			such as this constitutes anonymous information. Some of the individuals who 			access our services decline to use the personalization features that are 			available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the 			only data we collect about them is anonymous information.</p>
<p> 			2. Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that tells us 			specifically who you are, such as your name, email address or phone number. 			While you can search and browse some sections of our web site without being a 			registered user, certain activities do require registration, such as viewing 			and saving properties. Registering with MyNewPlace will also cause a cookie to 			be issued; this cookie allows MyNewPlace to "recognize" you when you are on our 			site to allow us to personalize our service for you. 		</p>
<h4> 			Anonymous Information 		</h4>
<p>  			As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and 			store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) 			addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, 			operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 		</p>
<p>  			We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze 			trends, to administer the site, to track users movements around the site and to 			gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 		</p>
<p> 			We may link this automatically-collected data to Personally Identifiable 			Information. 		</p>
<p> 			We use a third-party tracking service called WebSideStory that uses cookies to 			track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the 			aggregate. For information regarding WebSideStorys data collection and privacy 			practices, please visit 			<a rel="external" href="http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html">  				http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html</a>. 		</p>
<h4> 			Personally Identifiable Information 		</h4>
<p> 			In order to use the basic features of this Web site, you need not register or 			provide any personal information. However, if you wish to save any properties 			youve located, view specific details of a property or contact a property for 			information, you must first complete the registration form and create a user 			name and password. During registration you are required to give contact 			information (such as name and email address) as well as the time frame in which 			you intend to move. We use this information to contact you about the services 			on our site in which you have expressed interest. When you register with 			MyNewPlace, the information you provide to us is used to provide the service 			for which you have registered. Depending on the services you have chosen to 			use, some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information may be used by 			MyNewPlace to provide such services. Personally Identifiable Information may 			also be provided to intermediaries and third parties who assist MyNewPlace in 			providing you with the service you request. For example, if you register and 			desire to contact a property, some of your personally identifiable information 			may be shown to the property (e.g., contact information and time frame for 			moving). Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, however, 			MyNewPlace will not share, rent or sell your information to third parties 			without your permission. 		</p>
<p> 			In order to be eligible to receive cash back, you must also provide us with 			additional information about your new lease, such as monthly rent, length of 			lease and date of signing. In order to validate your eligibility for cash back 			offered by the property, we may disclose some of this Personally Identifiable 			Information to the property. 		</p>
<p> 			MyNewPlace is the sole owner of the information collected on 			www.mynewplace.com. MyNewPlace may collect Personally Identifiable Information 			from our users at several different points on our Web site. 		</p>
<h5> 			Special Offers and Updates 		</h5>
<p> 			We may occasionally send you information on services, special deals, products 			and/or promotions. 		</p>
<h5>  			Service-related Announcements 		</h5>
<p> 			We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when 			it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended 			for maintenance, we might send you an email. 		</p>
<p> 			Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not 			promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option 			to deactivate your account. 		</p>
<h5> 			Customer Service  		</h5>
<p> 			Based upon the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us, we may send 			you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also 			communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you 			request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or 			telephone, if you have provided such information. 		</p>
<h5> 			Profile 		</h5>
<p> 			We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, or clear gifs 			to create a profile of your preferences. We may tie your Personally 			Identifiable Information to information in the profile, in order to provide 			tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site 			for you. 		</p>
<h5>  			Blogs 		</h5>
<p> 			If you post to a blog on this site, you should be aware that any information 			you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these 			forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not 			responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in 			these forums. 		</p>
<h3> 			Cookies 		</h3>
<p> 			A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a users computer for 			record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We may link the 			information we store in cookies to any Personally Identifiable Information you 			submit while on our site. 		</p>
<p> 			We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies 			to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires 			when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for 			an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following 			directions provided in your Internet browsers help file. 		</p>
<p> 			We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you dont have to enter 			it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the 			interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 		</p>
<p>  			If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some 			areas of our site, such as saving properties, will be limited. 		</p>
<p>  			Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our site. 			We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement 			covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of 			cookies by any business partners or advertisers on our web site. See Third 			Party Advertisers. 		</p>
<h3> 			Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) 		</h3>
<p> 			We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web 			Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what 			content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, 			similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of 			Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard 			drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of 			the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by 			clear gifs to our customers Personally Identifiable Information. 		</p>
<p> 			We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have 			been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain 			communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. 		</p>
<h3> 			Third Party Advertisers 		</h3>
<p> 			The ads appearing on this web site, if any, may be delivered to users by 			third-party advertising companies. Third-party advertising companies may use 			cookies and clear GIFs on this site, which allow it to recognize a user’s 			cookie when a user visits this site. The companies serve their ads from their 			own web sites, independently from MyNewPlace. The information that the 			third-party advertising companies collect and share through this technology is 			not personally identifiable, unless you provide such information in response to 			an advertisement. 		</p>
<h3>  			Links to Other Sites 		</h3>
<p>  			This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by 			MyNewPlace. Please be aware that we, MyNewPlace, are not responsible for the 			privacy practices of such other sites. 		</p>
<p> 			We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy 			statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable 			information. 		</p>
<p> 			This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this web site. 		</p>
<h3> 			Access to Personally Identifiable Information 		</h3>
<p> 			If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, or if you no longer desire 			our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by contacting us 			at <a href="mailto:consumercare@mynewplace.com">consumercare@mynewplace.com</a>. 		</p>
<h3> 			Security 		</h3>
<p>  			MyNewPlace operates secure data networks protected by industry standard 			firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are 			periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized 			individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. You the 			consumer are ultimately responsible for the security of your MyNewPlace Member 			Name and password. Please take care to store your Member Name separately from 			your account password, or better yet, choose a password that you don’t need to 			write down at all. 		</p>
<h3> 			Business Transitions 		</h3>
<p> 			In the event MyNewPlace goes through a business transition, such as a merger, 			acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets as 			well as in the event of a bankruptcy, assignment for benefit of creditors or 			receivership, your personally identifiable information may be disclosed and 			will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent 			notice on our web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control 			of your personal information. 		</p>
<h3> 			Legal Disclaimer 		</h3>
<p>  			We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as 			required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our 			rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal 			process served on our web site. 		</p>
<h3> 			Your Privacy Rights Regarding Third Party Sharing 		</h3>
<p> 			To help service your requests, we may provide certain Personally Identifiable 			Information to third parties who may use this information for their own 			purposes, including sending advertising to you. 		</p>
<h3>  			Changes in this Privacy Statement 		</h3>
<p> 			If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this 			privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of 			what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if 			any, we disclose it. 		</p>
