	      <p>Mylelo takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more   about our privacy policy.</p>
	      <strong>How Mylelo Uses Your Personal Information</strong>
          <p>This policy covers how Mylelo treats personal information that Mylelo   collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Mylelo   products and services. Personal information is information about you that is   personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number,   and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>
          <strong>This privacy policy   only applies to Mylelo</strong>
          <p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Mylelo does not   own or control, or to people that Mylelo does not employ or manage.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <a name="collection" id="collection"></a>
          <h3>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h3>
          <strong>General</strong><br>
          <p>Mylelo collects personal information when you register with Mylelo, when you use Mylelo products or services, when you visit Mylelo pages or the pages of certain Mylelo  partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. Mylelo may combine information about you that we have with   information we obtain from business partners or other companies. </p>
          <p>When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address,   birth date, gender, industry, and personal interests. For   some financial products and services we might also ask for your address, Social   Security number, and information about your assets. When you register with   Mylelo and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. </p>
          <p>Mylelo collects information about your transactions with us and with some of   our business partners, including information about your use of financial   products and services that we offer.</p>
          <p>Mylelo automatically receives and records information from your computer and   browser, including your IP   address, Mylelo cookie information,   software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.</p>
          <p>Mylelo uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the   advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and   services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide   anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <a name="sharing" id="sharing"></a>
          <h3>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h3>
          <p>Mylelo does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with   other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services   you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following   circumstances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with   Mylelo under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal   information to help Mylelo communicate with you about offers from Mylelo and our   marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right   to share this information. </li>
            <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or   exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. </li>
            <li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate,   prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,   situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,   violations of Mylelo's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. </li>
            <li>We transfer information about you if Mylelo is acquired by or merged with   another company. In this event, Mylelo will notify you before information about   you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Mylelo displays targeted advertisements based on personal information.   Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact   with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteriaâ€”for example, women   ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mylelo does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you   interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an   ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the   assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. </li>
            <li>Mylelo advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks,   insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial   companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Mylelo works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers   in different industries and categories of business.</p>

          <h3>COOKIES</h3>
          <p>Mylelo may set and access Mylelo cookies on your   computer.</p>
          <p>Mylelo lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on   your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own   privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have   access to Mylelo's cookies.</p>
          <strong>Your Ability to   Edit  Your Account Information and Preferences</strong> <br>
          <strong>General</strong>
          <p>You can edit your Mylelo   Account Information, including your marketing preferences, at any   time. </p>
          <p>New categories of marketing communications might be added to the Marketing   Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can opt out of   receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can   unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive. </p>
          <p>We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the   Mylelo service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the   Mylelo Newsletter, that are considered part of your Mylelo account, without   offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. </p>

          <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h3>
          <p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe   reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products   or services to you or in order to do their jobs. </p>
          <p>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with   federal regulations to protect personal information about you. </p>

          <h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
          <p>Mylelo may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes   in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary   email address specified in your Mylelo account or by placing a prominent notice   on our site. </p>
