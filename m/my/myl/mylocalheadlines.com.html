(collectively, "you" or "users") value their privacy, 
and we have created this privacy policy to ensure that you understand 
our policies and procedures regarding the types of information we collect 
or that you may provide to us in connection with use of <a href="http://www.MyLocalHeadlines.com" target="_blank"><u>www.MyLocalHeadlines.com</u></a> (the "Site") and our MyLocalHeadlines 
service (the "Service") and how we use such information.</p>

<p><b>Personal Information Collection 
&amp; Usage:</b> MyLocalHeadlines only collects personal information from 
you when it is voluntarily provided by you. Personal information may 
include name, title, company, email address, physical address, telephone 
number, credit card information and similar information which identifies 
you. We may use this information in a variety of ways. For example, 
we may use this information so that you may obtain access to advertiser-only 
portions of the Service and/or to receive MyLocalHeadlines information, products 
and services. In addition, we may share your personal information with 
our affiliates, technical consultants, third party auditors and other 
third parties who make our Site and Service available, enhance its functionality 
or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in processing 
your orders and/or deliver the Services or related services. The personal 
information you provide is considered a company asset and may be included 
among transferred assets if our company or any of its assets are ever 
acquired by or transferred to a third party or an affiliate.</p>
<p>From time to time we may supplement 
personal information you give us with information from other sources, 
such as information validating your address. Thus, information we obtain 
through the Site and Service may be intermingled with and used in conjunction 
with information obtained through sources other than the Site or Service, 
including both offline and online sources.</p>
<p><b>Aggregate Information Collection 
&amp; Usage:</b> We may collect information from you in an aggregate, 
anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain nor 
be linked to any personal information. For instance, we may aggregate 
data based upon the advertisements you upload and deliver through our 
Service, the Targeting Criteria (described in the <a href="terms.php" target="_blank"><u>Terms and Conditions</u></a>) you select, the amount of money you 
spend on your account and other campaign or user data. MyLocalHeadlines uses 
this information to measure the use of our Site and Service, to report 
to our business partners aggregate statistics regarding use of our Service,

<p><b>Clickstream:</b> As you 
use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each 
web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to 
as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web 
site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and 
browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which 
you linked to the Site. We may use clickstream data as a form of aggregate 
information to anonymously determine how much time users spend on each 
page of our Site, how users navigate throughout the Site and how we 
may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of users. This information 
may be used to improve our Site and Service or to share with business 
partners. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous

Service may use "cookies" to improve our level of service

on your hard drive and when you return to that web site later, the cookie 
is transmitted back to the server that originally sent it to you. Cookies 
provide a way for a server to recall a previous request or previous 
registration, or to keep track of a transaction as it progresses, so 
that information does not have to be repeated. To be notified when you
