PII includes, but is not limited to, your name, your location, and other basic information you have shared with Facebook.

We may combine your PII with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other myList Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Application is used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver information to you according to your preferences.</span></li></ol><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c6" start="5"><li class="c3 c1"><span class="c0">We may also use your PII to contact you with myList messages, marketing or promotional information from myList and/or the suppliers of the things in your list and other communications that may be of interest to you. myList may also post on your behalf. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. You may, at any time, change the information and rights granted to myList by using the Facebook-provided myList app settings page. Some of the information provided is required to use myList and while you may elect not to provide this information, this choice will disable the App. </span></li></ol><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c6" start="6"><li class="c3 c1"><span class="c0">Log Data. When you visit the Application, our servers record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Application, pages of our Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for within our Application, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Application and the Service and for the Application’s technical administration, to increase our Application’s functionality and to better tailor our Application to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Application again, it will recognize you and serve information appropriate to your interests. We do not treat Log Data as PII nor use it in association with other PII, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Facebook Cookies</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c8">Like many websites, our Application use “cookies”; to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer or mobile device’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Application. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Application, to better understand how you interact with the Application and to monitor aggregate usage by myList Users and web traffic routing on the Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Application and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Application may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Application or all functionality of the Service.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phishing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are highly objectionable to myList. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you use the myList Application, other myList Users will see your name, your lists, including the name you give your lists, things you added, and information that you share. If you choose to provide PII within the thing itself or in the list names, other myList Users will see this additional PII.

The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
