            PRIVACY POLICY<br><br>
            </strong>
                <b>Mylaps.com Privacy Policy for the Internet</b><br>
                Mylaps.com believes strongly in protecting the privacy of the personally identifiable information you share with us, and respecting the permission you give us to use that information. (Personally identifiable information is information that can identify you by, for example, your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address.) We also believe it is important to disclose how we will use your information, and to give you choices about how it will be used. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Why should you share information with Mylaps.com?</b>
                <br><br>
                Sharing your personally identifiable information enables us to offer you a number of benefits. This will make it easier and more convenient for you to: 
                <br><br>
                <b>View a Lapchart of a race.</b><br>
                Get an overview of the events and sessions you entered.<br>
                View your personal laps for a session.<br>
                Receive personalized messages and special offers that are relevant to your interests.<br> 
                Save time by storing your preferences.<br> 
                <br><br><br>
                It will also allow us to conduct market research to help us develop better products, to provide more responsive customer service and to improve our web sites.
                <br><br>
                <b>Your choices</b><br>
                We want to know you better so we can serve you better. But the choice of whether you want this kind of service is up to you. We do not require visitors to Mylaps.com web sites to share personally identifiable information.
                We will only collect, use or share your personally identifiable information if you give us explicit permission to do so. By completing any online registration form (and checking/ticking the opt-in box where required by law), you are giving us permission to use and share your information under the rules set out below. 
                If you provide us with personally identifiable information, you will have reasonable access to that information so you can change it, delete it or withdraw your permission for us to use or share it. 
                You may do this by accessing your online profile, or by e-mailing or writing to us to request a copy of your profile at the contact address listed below. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Sharing information</b><br>
                You should know that by registering you are giving Mylaps.com permission to transfer your personally identifiable information from your home country to other Mylaps.com divisions, or selected companies around the world, who may communicate with you about products or special offers you may find useful. Some of these partner companies may repackage the information and use it under rules and conditions specified by Mylaps.com. 
                Mylaps.com will not share any personal financial information you provide (such as credit card information) with other companies. From time to time, this website may provide links to other websites. You should carefully review the privacy policies on those sites; they may differ from the Mylaps.com Privacy Policy.
                <br><br>
                <b>Cookies</b><br>
                Some of our web sites will send a "cookie," a small summary file, to your computer. This allows us to recognize your computer the next time you visit, without bothering you with another request to register. If you do not wish to receive cookies please refer to your Internet Browser to learn how to block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. To learn more about cookies we encourage you to visit www.cookiecentral.com

                We recognize our responsibility to protect the information you entrust to us. Mylaps.com uses a variety of secure techniques to protect your information, including secure servers, and encryption of financial data.
                Mylaps.com web sites also may make chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or newsgroups available to you. Please remember that any personally identifiable information that you provide in these areas becomes public information, and you should exercise caution in deciding to disclose it. It is important to note that Mylaps.com will release personally identifiable information if compelled by law.
