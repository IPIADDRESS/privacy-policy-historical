Using the MyRefers Site and Applications
We receive information when you interact with and use the MyRefers website, MyRefers Applications (e.g. MyRefers for iPhone, Android, etc.), and MyRefers platform technology, if any. For example, we know when you click on ads, upload your address book, join groups, participate in polls, install a MyRefers mobile application etc.<br>

Also, if you are logged into MyRefers and visit a third party site that embeds MyRefers professional plugins, MyRefers will receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. MyRefers will use this information to personalize the MyRefers-provided functionality, including providing you insights from your MyRefers network, allowing you to share information with your network, enabling you to use MyRefers functionality off the MyRefers site and serving you more relevant advertising. Users wishing to disable this personalization may&nbsp;opt-out&nbsp;of this feature. <br><br><span class="blue">Log files, IP Addresses and information about your computer and mobile device</span><br> 
                        Due to the communications standards on the internet, when you visit the MyRefers website we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave MyRefers. Additionally, advertisers receive the URL of the page you were on when you click on an ad on MyRefers. MyRefers also receives the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, your mobile device (including your UDID) and mobile operating system (if you are accessing MyRefers using a mobile device), as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. MyRefers may also receive location data passed to it from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have enabled.
