                                        MyRegistry collects and may track (1) the e-mail addresses of member visitors that communicate with MyRegistry via e-mail, (2) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms, order forms, surveys, e-mail, the “Contact Us” section of the Site, other inquiries visitors may make through the Site, and other online avenues (including, but not limited to, information such as demographic, business profile, and personal profile data), (3) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of member visitors to the Site, and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site member visitors access. MyRegistry places Internet “cookies” on member visitors’ hard drives to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Site. Internet cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive to enable our system to recognize your browser. Internet cookies save data about individual member visitors, such as the member visitor’s name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, and the pages of a site viewed by the member visitor. Internet cookies enable MyRegistry to track usage patterns and deliver customized content to users. Our cookies do have an expiration date. The “help” portion of your toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. MyRegistry also may use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain information related to member visits to and activity on the Site. A Web “bug” is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel graphics file, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity. A Web bug can gather, for example, the IP address of your computer, the time the Web page was viewed, and the type of browser used. When a member visitor performs a search within the Site, MyRegistry may record information identifying the member visitor or linking the member visitor to the search performed. MyRegistry may also record limited information for every member visit and search request, for example, in the form of a Web or Site log, and use that information to provide member visitors with a better experience while visiting our Site, to solve technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site, and to calculate overall usage statistics.

                                        MyRegistry has implemented security features that are designed to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information.

Once we receive personally-identifiable information, we take steps to protect its security on our systems. In the event we request or transmit sensitive information, such as credit card information, we use industry standard, secure socket layer (“SSL”) encryption.
