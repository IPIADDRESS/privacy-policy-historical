<p align="justify">Our  website uses cookies.  By using our website and agreeing to this  policy, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the  terms of this policy.</p>
<p><strong>About  cookies</strong></p>
<p> A  cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and  numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by  the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time  the browser requests a page from the server.</p>

<p>Cookies may  be either âpersistentâ cookies or âsessionâ cookies.  A  persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a  web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain  valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before  the expiry date). A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at  the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies  on this website</strong></p>
<p>We use both  session cookies and persistent cookies on this website.</p>
<p><strong>How we  use cookies</strong> </p>
<p>Cookies  do not contain any information that personally identifies you, but  personal information that we store about you may be linked, by us, to  the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>
