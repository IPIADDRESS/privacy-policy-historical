<h1><a name="top">PRIVACY POLICY</a></h1>
<p align="justify">We are committed to  safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets  out how we will treat your personal information.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>(1)	What information  do we collect?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">We may collect, store and  use the following kinds of personal information:</p>
<p align="justify"> (a) information about your computer and  about your visits to and use of this website (including your IP  address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating  system, referral source, length of visit, page views and website  navigation);</p>
<p align="justify"> (b)	information relating to any transactions carried out between you  and us on or in relation to this website, including information  relating to any purchases you make of our goods or services;</p>
<p align="justify"> (c) information that you provide to us for  the purpose of registering with us;</p>
<p align="justify"> (d)	information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing  to our website services, email notifications and/or newsletters; and</p>
<p align="justify"> (e)	any other information that you choose to send to us.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>(2)	Cookies</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> A  cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser,  and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the  server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This  enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. </p>
<p align="justify">We  may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on  the website.  We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you  whilst you navigate the website; and any billing/support desk or  control panel login. We will use the persistent cookies to: enable  our website to recognise you when you visit so that you don't have to  log in on every visit.</p>
<p align="justify">Session  cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your  browser.  Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer  until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
<p>Our  advertisers/payment services providers may also send you cookies. </p>
<p align="justify">We  publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website.   These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests.  To determine  your interests, Google will track your behaviour across the web using  cookies.  You can view, delete or add interest categories associated  with your browser using Google's Ads Preference Manager, available  at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/.  You can opt-out  of the Adsense partner network cookie at:  http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.  However, this opt-out  mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies from your  browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an  opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should  use the Google browser plug-in available at:  http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin.</p>
<p> Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers  allow you to reject just third party cookies.  For example, in  Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”,  “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all  cookies” using the sliding selector.  Blocking all cookies will,  however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites,  including this one.</p>
