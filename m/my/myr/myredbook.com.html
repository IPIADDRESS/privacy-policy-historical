However, We may disclose personal information about Browsers or Members, or information regarding Your use of the services or websites accessible through Our services, for any reason if, in Our sole discretion, We believe that it is reasonable to do so, including but not limited to the following situations:
    </li><li>&nbsp;<ul style="list-style: none; "><li>6.1.	To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information;

We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of Our network and systems by storing User data on a secured in-house database wholly separated from any User-accessible directories.
