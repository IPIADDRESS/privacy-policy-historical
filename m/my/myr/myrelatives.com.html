         <p><b>Our contact with you</b></p>
				<p>
                    When you sign up for our services or contact us for any purpose, you may provide contact information including a phone number, email and address. When you do so, you agree that it constitutes either a purchase or an initiation of a business relationship with MyRelatives. You agree that this signifies your consent for us to communicate with you using the contact information you provided. You may be contacted in one or more ways, including but not limited to a telephone call (in person or from a recorded message), email, text (SMS), or any other applicable method of communication. 

				</p>
        <p><b>Transactional communication</b></p>
				<p>
                    When you complete any type of transaction on MyRelatives.com, we may send you a notice or confirmation. Transactional communications may include order confirmations, customer service notifications, invoices or other relevant communications. If it becomes necessary, we may also send service-related communications. An example of a service-related communication would be a notification that an order is temporarily delayed, a service is temporarily unavailable or other relevant scenarios. These communications are not promotional, so you may not opt out of receiving them. 
				</p>
        <p><b>Promotional Communications</b></p>
				<p>
                   From time to time you may receive emails about special offers, discounts, new services or other promotions. You may choose to opt out of receiving these promotional communications and then you will no longer receive them. You may opt out of receiving promotional communications in two ways: 
                
                </p><ol>
                    <li>Every promotional email we send will include an Unsubscribe link at the bottom. When you click this link, we will automatically unsubscribe you from our mailing list. </li>
                    <li>When logged in to your account, click the “My Account” link and then update your settings under “Email Preferences.”</li>
                </ol>
                    Once you have Unsubscribed, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another promotional email from us. We may obtain your email address again in the future through another marketing program that you subscribe to. If this should happen, you may opt out again using the methods listed above. 
Please note that even if you opt out from promotional communications, you may still receive transactional communications from us related to your account, orders your place and other services. You may not opt out from these transactional communications. 
                <p></p>
         <p><b>Legal matters</b></p>
				<p>
                   Under certain circumstances we may, without your permission or consent, disclose your personal information or any communications that we received from you (this includes, without limitation, the contents of any message, chat, email or other communication from you) along with any additional information we have about you or your account as is permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to court order or subpoena).

                    <li>If your conduct while using this site, communicating with, or otherwise engaging with this site is in any way deemed inappropriate and not consistent with generally accepted behavioral norms.</li>
                    <li>In cases of emergencies that may involve potential threats to a person’s safety, the safety of any physical property, or if we believe that the information you provided may in any way relate to such a threat. </li>
				</ul>
                <p></p>
        <p><b>Sale/Transfer of business and/or assets</b></p>
				<p>
                    In the event that this site, or any businesses owned by this company, is sold or disposed of as a going concern (this could be by a sale of assets, merger, bankruptcy, insolvency or any other method), then any Personally Identifiable Information that we have obtained from our members and/or visitors to this site may be listed as an asset that will be sold or merged as part of that transaction.
