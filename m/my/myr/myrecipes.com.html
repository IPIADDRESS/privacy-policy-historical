		You can unsubscribe from the e-mail newsletters and/or direct mail/catalog list at any time by following the instructions in the section below “Reviewing, Changing Your Information or Unsubscribing.” When you ask that we notify your customers of your registry, we collect your customers’ name and e-mail address. We use your customers' name and e-mail address only to send them the notification e-mail.<br><br>
		When you create a registry, customers can see your names, wedding date (month and year), wedding location (city and state), the items you have registered for, and the quantities you have received. If you password-protect the customer view of your registry, customers initially see only your names, wedding date and location. They need a password (provided to them by you) to view the items you have registered for.<br><br>
