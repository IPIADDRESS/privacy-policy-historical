<h2>NO ERROR FREE PERFORMANCE</h2>

    We customarily release alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the

    concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products generally, in all stages of release. MyxerTones 
    does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. We will use reasonable efforts to 
    comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to 
    comply with our privacy policy. MyxerTones shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or 
    punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of 
    the United States.
