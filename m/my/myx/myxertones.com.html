<h1>Myxer™ Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
   Myxer™ understands the importance of privacy and is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. 
   This Privacy Policy explains how Myxer™ collects and uses your personal information. 
</p>

<h2>WHY DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

<p>
    Myxer™ collects personal information to improve the manner by which we operate and offer our products and services. 
    We use the personal information to communicate with you about those products and services, and provide effective, timely 
    customer support when needed. We will never rent or sell any of the personal information we collect from you to anyone, 
    and will not share your personal information with anyone without your consent except as described in this Privacy Policy. 
</p>

<h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

<p>
    The information we gather is different based upon the services that you use.

    such as your birth year and zip code.</li>

    address.</li>

    (such as operating system, connection speed, and peripherals); mobile phone device information and network carrier 
    information and the Internet IP address and URL of the website that sent you to the Myxer™ registration page.</li>

    personalization information).</li> 
    <li>We collect your musical usage patterns and types of music you listen to and whether you logged into or out of a Myxer™ service, 
    or changed your password or billing information.</li>

    set forth below. 
</p>

<h2>HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</h2>

<p>
     Myxer uses cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that 
     visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements. Myxer uses cookies to customize newsletter, advertising, and web page content 
     based on browser type and user profile information. Myxer uses cookies to help track usage to help us understand which parts of our website 
     are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. <br><br>
     Myxer does not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our 
     site. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is 
     set. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie 
     preferences, however, you must enable cookies in order to use most functions on the Myxer website. 
</p>

<h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

<p>
    Myxer™ uses your mobile phone number and mobile phone device information to deliver to you mobile phone content such as 
    ringtones, full-track music downloads, pictures, and videos.<br><br>
    Myxer™ uses your other personal information to deliver to you and bill you for Myxer™ products and services, and communicate 
    with you concerning your account and customer service issues. This may include: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>verifying authorization of credit card usage before any purchase of premium content or services; </li>
    <li>updating you on important changes to your account such as the receipt of payments and thanks for inviting your friends.</li>
    <li>determining if you meet the minimum system requirements to use our products, and providing information concerning compatibility and interoperability to you;</li>
    <li>asking you to participate in surveys about products, services, news and events; </li>
    <li>offering you product upgrades, content and services for you to purchase; </li>
    <li>providing you with content, services, instructions, and a more personalized experience based on personal information, such as zip/postal code and any content or other preferences you provide; </li>
    <li>in the case of the Myxer™ Desktop Agent or any other downloaded Myxer™ software, auto-updating that downloaded Myxer™ software; </li>
    <li>providing you with news, free newsletters, updates, targeted advertising, promotions, and special offers that give you a better understanding of how our products are used. </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The information that makes up your "public profile" can be viewed at <a href="/m2/account/profile.aspx">http://www.myxertones.com/m2/account/profile.aspx</a>. In 
    general, the display name you choose to associate with your account, and an optional image you may have chosen to use to 
    represent you, are public information that may be shared with others.  In addition, information about what band "fanlists" 
    you have joined, and what content you have recently contributed to or downloaded from MyxerTones are public by default.  
    You may choose to hide this last bit of information by choosing the appropriate selections from 
    <a href="/m2/account/profile.aspx">http://www.myxertones.com/m2/account/profile.aspx</a>.
</p>

<h2>HOW DO WE HANDLE CHILDREN’S PRIVACY CONCERNS?</h2>

<p>
    Myxer does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information 
    on any Myxer website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our websites is directed to persons under 13. If you 
    are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Myxer websites or services at any time or in any manner. 
    If Myxer learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Myxer 
    websites without verified parental consent, then Myxer will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
</p>

<h2>WHEN AND HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h2>

<p>
    Myxer™ does not sell, rent, or share your personal information to anyone unless you consent to provide such information. 
    Myxer™ may disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors (e.g. a customer service contractor or a 
    credit card clearing service) in order for them to provide specific services for Myxer™, and to better serve our customers. 
    Myxer™' contractors are bound by strict contractual requirements to keep all personal information they process strictly 
    confidential and to use such information solely on behalf of Myxer™. Also, Myxer™ may disclose your personal information 
    if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:<br><br>
    (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Myxer™;<br>
    (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Myxer™ and its products; or <br>
    (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Myxer™ products or the public at large.<br>
</p>

<p>
    The Myxer™ websites and products may contain links to other websites and products. Myxer™ is not responsible for the 
    privacy practices or the content of such websites or products. Please visit the privacy policies of these sites in order 
    to understand their privacy policies and data collection practices. 
</p>

<h2>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<p>
    We frequently revise this Privacy Policy to keep it up to date with Myxer™ products, services and web pages. 
</p>

<h2>NO ERROR FREE PERFORMANCE</h2>
<p>
    We customarily release alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final 
    version. Because these products are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite 
    our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products 
    generally, in all stages of release. Myxer™ does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. We will use 
    reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to 
    comply with our privacy policy. Myxer™ shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to 
    this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States. <br><br>
</p>

    If you have questions about the privacy aspects of our products or services or would like to make a 
    complaint, please contact: <a href="mailto:support@myxertones.com">support@myxertones.com</a><br><br>
