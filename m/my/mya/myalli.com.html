        of visitors to its web sites and is committed to the protection of their 
        personal information. This privacy statement explains data collection 
        and use practices of the GlaxoSmithKline site (the “Site”). 
      </p> 
      <p><strong>Binding Nature</strong><br>
        By accessing and using the Site, you agree and consent to the collection, 
        use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy 
        Statement. </p>
      <p><strong>Description of the information GSK may collect
        </strong></p>
      <p><strong>1. Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
        GSK collects personally identifiable information (i.e. information from 
        which you can be identified, such as name, address, telephone number or 
        e-mail address) only when it is asked for and/or you voluntarily submit 
        it to us on this Site. We may use the information to respond to your requests, 
        improve our level of service and the content of our web site; provide 
        you with tips, helpful information, product news and updates; notify you 
        of new GSK products and services; seek your views on our products and 
        services; and for our own internal purposes. <br><br>
        This Site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age 
        of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information 
        via this Site from visitors in that age group without the explicit consent 
        of a parent or guardian. </p>
      <p><strong>2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
        GSK also collects non-personally identifiable information in aggregate 
        form to track data such as the total number of visits to our web sites, 
        the number of visitors to each page of our web sites, and the domain names 
        of our visitors' internet service providers. We use this information, 
        which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our visitors use our 
        web sites so that we may improve them and the services we offer. We may 
        also share this information with other companies within the GlaxoSmithKine 
        group and with other third parties. NO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 
        IS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROCESS. </p>
      <p><strong>Use of IP Addresses</strong> <br>
        An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a set of numbers that is automatically 
        assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service 
        provider or through your organisation's local area network (LAN) or wide 
        area network (WAN). Web servers automatically identify your computer by 
        the IP address assigned to it during your session online. </p>
      <p>GSK, or third party companies acting on behalf of GSK, may collect IP 
        addresses for the purposes of systems administration and to audit the 
        use of our site. We do not ordinarily link a user's IP address to personally 
        identifiable information of that user, which means each user's session 
        will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. However, we may 
        use IP addresses to identify users of our site when we feel it is necessary 
        to enforce compliance with the site's terms of use, or to protect our 
        service, site or other users. </p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
        This Site uses a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a 
        small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. 
        Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site or help us analyze 
        usage of the Site more accurately. For instance, our server may set a 
        cookie that keeps you from having to enter a password more than once during 
        a visit to the Site. In all cases in which cookies are used, we will not 
        collect personally identifiable information without your explicit permission. 
        The only personally identifiable information GSK collects is the information 
        you voluntarily provide.</p>
      <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web Browsers 
        automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser 
        setting to decline cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored, 
        if you prefer. Please refer to your Internet Browser’s instructions 
        or help screen to learn more about these functions. If you choose to decline 
        cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features 
        of this Site or any other web sites that you visit.</p>
      <p>If you wish to disable GSK’s ability to track your website interactions, 
        you have the ability to Opt-out of our third party tracking software. 
        Visit <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/optout.html?return_url=&amp;javascript_enabled=true" target="_top">http://www.omniture.com/privacy/optout.html?return_url=&amp;javascript_enabled=true</a> 
        and follow the Opt-Out Policy Instructions. The opt out process will require 
        that you permit the placement of a cookie on your computer that indicates 
        that you do not wish to be tracked by GSK. In the event you remove your 
        cookies from your computer, tracking will resume. </p>
      <p><strong>How we protect your personal information</strong><br>
        GSK is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. 
        GSK uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect 
        your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. 
        For example, we store the personal information you provide to GSK on computer 
        servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. 
        While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will 
        not occur, we make every commercially reasonable effort to prevent such 
        unfortunate occurrences. </p>
      <p><strong>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties</strong><br>
        GSK will not sell or rent personally identifiable information to any third 
        party for any purpose. Sometimes selected third parties are however used 
        to provide GSK with support services in connection with its web sites 
        and such parties may, from time to time, have access to your information 
        to enable them to provide those services to GSK. Please rest assured that 
        all companies providing such support services are required by GSK to meet 
        the same standards of data protection as GSK and are prohibited from using 
        the information for their own marketing purposes.</p>
      <p>In certain special cases, we may disclose your personally identifiable 
        information in the following circumstances:</p>
      <table width="99%" border="0">
        <tbody><tr> 
          <td width="6%">&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="94%">1. when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information 
            is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone 
            who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering 
            with GSK's rights, property or operations, other users of this site, 
            or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; or </td>

            civil case or administrative investigation. </td>

      <p>Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed 
        in your country of residence or any other country in which GSK or its 
        affiliates, subcontractors or agents maintain facilities, and by using 
        the Site, you consent to any transfer of information outside of your country 
        of residence. GSK will ensure that if information is transferred outside 
        your country of residence, it will still be treated in accordance with 
        this privacy statement.</p>
      <p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong><br>
        This Site may provide links to other GSK and third party web sites as 
        a service to our users. The privacy statement described here does not 
        apply to those sites. <strong>Please ensure you check the legal and privacy 
        statement posted on each site you link to.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Changes</strong><br>
        We may occasionally update this privacy statement. We encourage you to 
        periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how 
        we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued 
        use of the Site constitutes your agreement to the privacy statement and 
        any updates. <br>
