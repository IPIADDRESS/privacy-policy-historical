                      <p align="left">The United States Department of Commerce and the European  Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently  asked questions (FAQs) to enable U.S.  companies to satisfy European Union (EU) law requirements for adequate  protection of personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States.&nbsp; ACN adheres to these Safe Harbor Principles,  as outlined below.</p>
                      <p align="left"><strong>Notice and  Choice:</strong> When ACN collects  personal information from customers in the EU, ACN will inform them about the  types of personal information it collects from them, the purposes for which ACN  collects and uses it, and the types of third parties to the information may be  disclosed.&nbsp; ACN will inform the customers  about the choices and means that ACN uses of limiting the use or disclosure of  such information.</p>
                      <p align="left"><strong>Data  Integrity:</strong> ACN seeks to  ensure that any personal information held about EU individuals is accurate,  complete, current and otherwise reliable in relation to the purposes for which  the information was obtained. ACN collects personal information that is  adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purposes for which it is to be  processed. EU individuals have a responsibility to assist ACN in maintaining  accurate, complete and current personal information about them.</p>
                      <p align="left"><strong>Transfers To  Third Parties:</strong> ACN will  only transfer personal information about EU individuals to third-parties where  the third-party (a) has provided satisfactory assurances to ACN that it will  protect the information consistently with this Statement; or (b) is located in  the EU or a country considered "adequate" for privacy by the EU  Commission; or (c) the third-party has also certified to the Safe Harbor, and  is accordingly independently responsible for complying with the Safe Harbor  requirements.</p>
                      <p align="left"><strong>Access and  Correction:</strong> Upon written  request to ACN, ACN will provide EU individuals with reasonable access to their  personal information. &nbsp;Except as may be  subject to legal limitation, ACN will make reasonable steps to allow EU  individuals to review their information for the purposes of correcting their  information. </p>
                      <p align="left"><strong>Enforcement:</strong> ACN uses the self-assessment approach to  maintain compliance with its Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  ACN periodically verifies that its policy is accurate, comprehensive for  the information covered, displayed appropriately, implemented and in conformity  with Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
                      <p align="left"><strong>Limitations:</strong> Adherence to this Privacy Policy may be  limited to the extent required to meet a legal, governmental, national security  or public interest obligation.</p>
