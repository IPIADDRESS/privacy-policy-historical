          </h3>
            <p align="left"><b><br>
            Overview<br>
            </b>ACN Opportunity, LLC and ACN Communications  Services, Inc. (collectively “ACN”) are committed to protecting the privacy of  our customer information. This document will provide information about ACN's  policy relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information  and of our customer's right to limit such collection, use or disclosure. All  personal information relating to our customers is maintained in strict  confidence by ACN and is not sold to third parties. For your protection, we  utilize a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) on all pages that require you to complete  personal information.&nbsp;Our privacy policies and procedures are subject  to change.<br>
              <b><br>
              Identifying Purposes<br>
              </b>ACN collects personal  information for a variety of purposes related to your request for services from  ACN. Personal information is used to verify, process and administer your  product and service requests, assess credit-worthiness, maintain our commercial  relationship with you, and analyze, understand and respond to your service  needs. ACN also analyzes and uses customer information to improve the products  that we offer to our customers. We analyze personal information in order to  identify the products and services offered by our affiliates or ourselves or by  companies that we believe may be of interest to you, and to offer you those  products and services.</p>
            <p align="left">Personal information is also used in order to  communicate with you for billing and provisioning purposes. ACN does not sell,  rent or lease personal information to third parties.&nbsp;From time to time ACN may outsource certain  account processing, or other customer service functions to a third party. In  such cases, personal information will be provided to such third parties.  However, ACN releases personal information only where that information will be  maintained in confidence.</p>
            <p align="left">From time to time ACN is also required report to  regulatory bodies or to present a summary of all our customer information,  including your personal information, in statistical or analytical form to  governmental authorities and industry organizations. When information is  provided in statistical or analytical form, information that might specifically  identify you will not be disclosed.<br>
              <b><br>
              Cardholder Data</b><br>
              To receive payment for services prior to  initially providing service, or at the time payment is due for an existing  service, ACN often requires customers to conduct transactions with a credit or  debit card.  In order to facilitate future  or recurring payments, fees, or other charges for services, ACN may require a  customer to provide a credit or debit card to be stored for such future uses.  Each customer's credit or debit card has a primary  account number (“PAN”), cardholder name, expiration date and/or service code (collectively,  “Cardholder Data”).  ACN maintains a  Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) compliance program, as  well as other credit card controls that are consistent with PCI DSS.</p>
            <p>Although ACN applies current industry  standards in order to protect Cardholder Data, including PCI DSS, no method of  processing, transmission, or storage of Cardholder Data is 100% secure.  Therefore, ACN cannot guarantee that its safeguards will prevent every  unauthorized attempt to access, obtain, use or disclose Cardholder Data. In the  event a customer suspects a security issue regarding Cardholder Data, the  customer should immediately contact ACN's Privacy Officer at the address listed  at the end of this document.</p>
            <p><b>Collection and Use<br>
              </b>ACN will collect and use  customer identifiable information for billing purposes, to provide and change  service, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, or to create and  inform you of products and services that better meet your needs. This means  that ACN may use your customer identifiable information, in conjunction with  information available from other sources, to market new services to you that we  think will be of interest to you, but we will not disclose your customer identifiable  information to third parties who want to market products to you.<br>
              <b><br>
              Security<br>
              </b>ACN has implemented and  will update technological and security features to safeguard the privacy of  your customer identifiable information from unauthorized access or improper  use.<br>
              <b><br>
              E-mail Contents<br>
              </b>The company will not  read or disclose to third parties private e-mail communications that are  transmitted using ACN services, except as required to operate the service or as  otherwise authorized by law.&nbsp;ACN will never request sensitive personal  information through email. Do not respond to e-mails requesting credit  information, account numbers, passwords or PINs. Call the company to verify the  legitimacy of the e-mail.<br>
  <b><br>
  Disclosure<br>
  </b>ACN may also use  customer identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially  unlawful activity or if required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal  process.<br>
  <b><br>
  Account Information<br>
  </b>ACN honors requests from  customers to review all customer identifiable information maintained in  reasonably retrievable form, and will correct any such information which may be  inaccurate. Customers may verify that appropriate corrections have been  made.<br>
  <b><br>
  Children<br>
  </b>ACN complies with all  Federal laws and regulations, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection  Act, which requires the consent of a parent or guardian for the collection of  personally identifiable information from children under 13.<br>
  <b><br>
  Safe Harbor<br>
  </b>ACN complies with the  U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set  forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and  retention of personal information from European Union member countries and  Switzerland.&nbsp; ACN has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy  Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity,  access, and enforcement.&nbsp; To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and  to view ACN's certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>. ACN adheres to these Safe Harbor Principles,  as outlined below.<br>
  <b><br>
    Notice and Choice:</b>&nbsp;When ACN collects personal information from  customers in the EU or Switzerland, ACN will inform them about the types of  personal information it collects from them, the purposes for which ACN collects and uses it, and the types of third parties to the information may be  disclosed. ACN will inform the customers about the choices and means that ACN uses of limiting the use or disclosure of such information.<br>
  <b><br>
    Data Integrity:</b>&nbsp;ACN seeks to ensure that any personal information held  about EU and Swiss individuals is accurate, complete, current and otherwise  reliable in relation to the purposes for which the information was obtained. ACN collects personal information that is adequate, relevant and not excessive  for the purposes for which it is to be processed. EU and Swiss individuals have a responsibility to assist ACN in maintaining accurate, complete and current  personal information about them.<br>
  <b><br>
    Transfers To Third Parties:&nbsp;</b>ACN will only transfer personal  information about EU and Swiss individuals to third-parties where the  third-party (a) has provided satisfactory assurances to ACN that it will  protect the information consistently with this Statement; or (b) is located in  the EU, Switzerland, or a country considered "adequate" for privacy  by the EU Commission or Switzerland, as applicable; or (c) the third-party has  also certified to the applicable Safe Harbor, and is accordingly independently  responsible for complying with the Safe Harbor requirements.<br>
  <b><br>
    Access and Correction:&nbsp;</b>Upon written request to ACN, ACN will provide  EU and Swiss individuals with reasonable access to their personal information. Except as may be subject to legal limitation, ACN will make reasonable  steps to allow EU and Swiss individuals to review their information for the  purposes of correcting their information.<br>
  <b><br>
    Enforcement:</b>&nbsp;ACN uses the self-assessment approach to maintain  compliance with its Privacy Policy.&nbsp; ACN periodically verifies that its  policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information covered, displayed  appropriately, implemented and in conformity with Safe Harbor Principles.&nbsp;  ACN also encourages individuals covered by this Statement to raise any concerns  about our processing of their personal information by contacting the ACN  Privacy Officer at the address below or the ACN Legal Department.&nbsp; ACN  will seek to resolve any concerns.&nbsp; In the event a dispute arises that the  parties cannot resolve, the parties may resolve it through arbitration with the  American Arbitration Association program developed to assist in the compliance  with Safe Harbor.&nbsp; The arbitration shall be held in Concord, North  Carolina before a panel of three arbitrators, each side choosing one and then  the two choosing the third.&nbsp; All claims hereunder must be brought within  two years of the date of which the facts or circumstances giving rise to the  claim are alleged to have happened.&nbsp; Laws of the state of New York will  apply to the resolution of the dispute unless otherwise agreed in writing.<br>
  <b><br>
  Limitations:</b>&nbsp;Adherence to this Privacy  Policy may be limited to the extent required to meet a legal, governmental,  national security or public interest obligation.<br>
            </p>
            Should you have any questions with respect to  the ACN Privacy Policy (Safe Harbor) or if you do not consent to, or would like  to limit, the manner in which information about you is collected, used or  disclosed, please contact the ACN Privacy Officer in writing at ACN Inc., 1000  Progress Place, Concord, N.C. 28025-2449.</td>
