      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>Effective: February 25, 2014</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>SUMMARY</h4>

      <p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
      <p>This Policy (together with the Site’s Terms  of Use if posted, (incorporated by reference)  describes our treatment of information provided or collected on or through the  Site. Please note that unless otherwise expressly set forth, the Policy applies  only to your activities on the Site and does not apply to activities that are “offline”  or unrelated to the Site. Different privacy policies may apply to other parts  of ADT’s web presence that do not link to this Policy.</p>
      <p>If you would like to obtain additional  information regarding our privacy practices offline, you may refer to <a href="/content/dam/adt/downloads/about-adt/ADT-Code-of-Conduct_Ethics.pdf" target="_blank">ADT’s Code of Conduct</a> or simply <a href="mailto:privacy@adt.com">Contact  Us</a> with your questions or concerns.</p>
      <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong><br>
        We want  you, our customer, to understand how we collect and use data about your Site  visit, specifically the portions of the Site that require you to register  and/or log in to gain access. The privacy policy below identifies what  information the Site collects, and what it is used for. We use cookies, which  gather certain forms of information from your computer, to help us monitor and  improve Site usage and performance. Certain web pages may allow you to  voluntarily submit personal information about yourself, your residence, or your  business so that we can contact you for services in which you express an  interest. For online recruiting purposes, the Site collects “personally  identifiable information”, which is information that identifies you. This may  include your name, address, email address, telephone or fax number, IP address,  any content you post in your resume or CV, and certain other information, which  we explain in more detail below. You can choose not to provide us with this  information, but certain portions of the Site may not be available to you. </p>
      <p>We do not  disclose this information to third parties for their marketing purposes without  your prior consent, but we do use third party software and services to assist  us with collecting and analyzing information regarding use of the Site. &nbsp;We may also disclose your information to  others for other purposes, particularly if required to do so by law. The privacy  policy for the Site is set forth below and you should contact <a href="mailto:privacy@adt.com">privacy@adt.com</a> you have questions or concerns about this  policy or the use of your information.</p>
      <p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong></p>
      <p><em>Anonymous Information</em>. We may collect two  types of information through this Site: anonymous information and personally  identifiable information (“PII”). We collect certain anonymous data regarding  the usage of the website. This information does not personally identify users,  by itself or in combination with other information. We gather it to improve the  performance of the Site. &nbsp;The anonymous  data we collect can include information such as the type of browser you are  using, IP address, the pages you view, and the length of your visit to the  Site. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Personally Identifiable Information.</em> We may also ask you  to provide personally identifiable information on the Site, which may include  your name, address, telephone number, fax number, company name, e-mail address  and relevant details about the product or service that interests you. &nbsp;These details may include whether the location  is a business or residence, whether the site is pre-wired for security, and the  square footage, to give some examples. This information can be gathered when  you send us an e-mail or when you complete the specific web page request form. &nbsp;In all such cases you choose whether to  provide us with the personally identifiable information, but certain portions  of the Site may not be available to you or we may not be able to respond to  your inquiry effectively if you do not provide the PII requested.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><em>My Account.</em> In order to provide some of the  services on the Site, we ask you to provide additional personal information  regarding your customer account with ADT. This additional information may  include existing account numbers, payment or credit card details, service  preferences and so forth. We will use this information only to support your  customer relationship with ADT. This includes responding to your requests,  customizing your experience on the Site, communicating with you about your  account, and providing you choices about how to view and manage the products  and services that you receive from ADT.</p>
      <p><em>Customer Service Correspondence. </em>We and our third  party service providers may also collect personal information related to  customer service correspondence. This information may include e-mails, internet  chats, faxes, or telephone calls directed to our customer service centers. We  process this information to provide you with customer services, handle your  complaints or disputes, measure and improve our customer services, and to  detect and prevent fraud or violations of our legal obligations. We will only  retain customer service information as long as is reasonably required to carry  out our business purposes or to comply with applicable legal obligations.</p>
      <p><em>Surveys and Contests.</em> We may occasionally  request information from you via surveys or contests. &nbsp;Your participation in these surveys or  contests is completely voluntary. &nbsp;The  information that we request typically includes your contact details. If you  choose to participate, the information that you provide will be shared with the  contest/survey sponsors to notify winners and award prizes. Survey information  may also be used to monitor and improve the content and performance of the  Site. </p>
      <p><em>Tell A Friend</em>. If you choose to  use ADT’s referral service to inform a friend about our Site, products or  services, ADT will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will  send your friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. We will  store this information so that we can send the initial email message and track  the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adt.com">privacy@adt.com</a> to have their information removed from our database.</p>
      <p><strong>ONLINE ACTIVITY AND TRACKING </strong><br>
        Like many  websites, the Site employs technologies such as cookies and web beacons (also  known as clear GIFs) to automatically receive and store certain information  about your use of the Site. We use this information to permit the Site to  function properly, to evaluate how you use the Site, to determine where you are  located, and to support website analytics and our marketing efforts.</p>
      <p><em>Use of Cookies.</em> Cookies refer to  small bits of data that are based on your internet activity and stored as text  files by your internet browser on your computer’s hard drive. Through the use  of cookies, we may collect information about your location and your online  activity on the Site, such as the specific web pages that you visit, the links  you click, and the serves you perform on the Site. When you visit other  websites where we advertise, we or a third party may use data collected on the  Site to show you interest-based advertisements. Although most internet browsers  are initially set to accept cookies, you can generally find a “help” section on  the browser toolbar that will inform you how to stop accepting cookies, to be  notified when you receive a browser cookie, and to disable existing browser  cookies. However, without browser cookies you will be unable to take advantage  of all the features that the Site has to offer.</p>
      <p><em>Use of Web Beacons.</em> Web beacons are tiny  graphics embedded on a website that allow the website to transfer or collect  information through a graphic image request. We may use web beacons to collect  information about your web browsing activities to help us determine if a  particular webpage on the Site has been visited, and, if so, how many times.  This information permits us or third parties to deliver interest-based  advertisements, measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising,  and to customize the services offered to the Site’s users. We do not tie the  information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ personally identifiable  information.</p>
      <p>Certain  pages on our site contain “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel  tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information  such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the  beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the  page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the  page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. We use log files  to store the data that is collected through web beacons. ADT also uses third  party web beacons to help manage online advertising. These web beacons are  provided by our ad management partners, Google Analytics, and Omniture. These  files enable Google Analytics and Omniture to recognize a unique cookie on your  web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users  to our web site. The cookie on your web browser was placed by ADT, or by  another advertiser who works with Google Analytics. With both cookies and web  beacon technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and  not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone  number, or email address. For more information about Google Analytics,  including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <a href="http://www.google-analytics.com/" title="http://www.google-analytics.com/" target="_blank">www.google-analytics.com</a>.  For more information about Omniture, including how to opt out of these  technologies, go to <a href="http://www.omniture.com/" title="http://www.omniture.com/" target="_blank">www.omniture.com.</a></p>
      <p><em>Third Parties.</em> As noted above, we  have relationships with third party service providers to place advertisements  on our behalf on other websites, to perform tracking and other similar  functions for the Site and our advertisements, and to assist us in providing  you with customer services. While we do not share your personal information  with these companies, they may automatically collect information about your  visit to the Site, your IP address, your browser and your network by using  cookies and web beacons. Such information may be used to present you with  advertisements tailored to your interests, to provide you with customer  service, and to better understand how the Site is used, among other things. Any  information collected by such third parties via cookies or web beacons is not  linked to any personal information that we collect from you. The use of cookies  and web beacons by third parties is governed by their privacy policies, not  this Web Privacy Policy. Some of these third party companies may be members of  the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers additional information  regarding cookies and web beacons, as well as a single location to opt out of  interest-based advertising from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadertising.com/" target="_blank">www.networkadertising.com</a>). </p>
      <p><strong>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong> <br>
        <em>Uses by ADT. </em>ADT uses  the personal information you provide through the Site in a manner that is  consistent with this Web Privacy Policy. If you provide personal information  for a certain reason, we may use it in connection with the reason for which it  was provided. &nbsp;For instance, if you  contact us by email, we may use the personal information you provide to answer  your question or resolve your problem. We use the information collected through  the Site for statistical purposes and for improving the Site, as well as for  our marketing purposes and potentially sending commercial emails to you. &nbsp;We often engage a third party’s software or  services to assist us with these collections and analyses. &nbsp;As a practical matter, we must release your  mailing address to a postal or courier service to deliver information you  requested. We use third-parties to assist us with our marketing efforts,  including assisting us with sending emails to you. This may include sending you  free electronic newsletters and marketing-related emails for services described  on our Site. &nbsp;However, you will have the  choice to opt out of receiving newsletters and marketing emails for our  services by either contacting us directly at <a href="mailto:privacy@adt.com">privacy@adt.com</a> or  through the “unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of our newsletters and  emails.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In  addition to using your information to populate your My Account pages, ADT and  our agents will use your personal information to process purchase orders that  you submit via the Site and enable you to track the progress of purchase  orders. This may include sharing certain data with delivery providers such as  UPS and providing you access to shipper tracking numbers. &nbsp;Similarly, if you qualify for any rewards  based on your purchase history, this information will also be processed by ADT  and our agents to enable your access to these benefits.</p>
      <p>On certain  of our Site pages where you have submitted detailed information concerning  potential products or services, we will use this information only for the  purposes of contacting you and determining which product or services may be  most relevant to you. We will not share this information with any third party  for their own marketing purposes without your prior consent.</p>
      <p>We may  also disclose personally identifiable information in order to respond to a  subpoena, court order or other such request. We may also provide such  personally identifiable information in response to a law enforcement agency's  request or as otherwise required by law.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>We may  provide your personally identifiable information to a third party if we file  for bankruptcy, or there is a transfer of the assets or ownership in connection  with proposed or consummated corporate reorganizations, such as mergers,  acquisitions, or sales of business units.</p>
      <p><em>Uses by  Third-Parties.<strong> </strong></em><em>We may also provide your  personally identifiable information to third party service providers that help  us to provide you with products and services. These third party service  providers have access to such information on a confidential basis and only to  the extent necessary to perform their requested functions.</em></p>
      <p><em>We do not provide your  personally identifiable information to any third party for their own marketing  purposes without your prior request or consent. Sometimes these businesses make  special offers available to Site customers. If you request to receive  information about these offers, we will share your personal information with  these companies so that they can send you details about their special offers.  You should know in advance that each of these companies has its own policies  with respect to the collection and use of personal information and that we are  not responsible for their use of your information. </em></p>
      <p><strong>INFORMATION SECURITY AND SECURE TRANSACTIONS</strong><br>
        We have implemented  various security measures for the purpose of protecting your personal  information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss,  alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access and against any other unlawful  forms of processing. When you create a user profile and log in to a secure  portion of our Site, your personal information benefits from the protections of  Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology. Our web servers have been enabled with  SSL technology to automatically encrypt your information and help prevent  unauthorized parties from viewing your account or payment information during a  secure session. This is why you must enter your unique user name and password  each time you access your account information online or place a purchase order  through the Site.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for maintaining  the confidentiality of your user name and password. You are responsible for all  uses of your password, whether or not authorized by you. You must inform us  immediately of any unauthorized use or your user name or password.</p>
      <p>However,  the transmission of data over the internet by its nature entails the use of  systems under the control of third parties, and as a result ADT will work to  prevent any violation of the security systems but cannot ensure total control  of the security of such systems.</p>
      <p><strong>OTHER WEBSITES</strong> <br>
        Please be aware that our Site may  contain links to other sites on the internet that are owned and operated by  third parties. Our  Site utilizes framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on  the site when the user is actually on a third party website. For example, if  you are on a page that has the look and feel of www.adt.com but the URL listed  in the properties of your browser is a different URL, then know that the  information is being collected by this third party and their Privacy Policy  governs the collection and use of this information.</p>
      <p>The  information practices of those websites linked to our Site are not covered by  this Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of websites to  which the Site links.&nbsp; If you provide any  information to such third parties, different rules regarding the collection and  use of your PII may apply. We strongly suggest you review such third party's  privacy policies before providing any data to them.&nbsp;These other sites may  send their own cookies or web beacons to users, collect data or solicit  personally identifiable information. &nbsp;We cannot control this collection of  information. You should contact these entities directly if you have any  questions about their use of the information that they collect. </p>
      <p><strong>CHILDREN</strong> <br>
        ADT understands the importance of protecting children’s privacy in the  interactive online world. &nbsp;The Site  covered by this policy is not designed for or intentionally targeted at  children 13 years of age or younger. It is not our policy to intentionally  collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13. </p>
      <p><strong>INQUIRIES</strong>, <strong>CORRECTIONS AND COMPLAINTS</strong><br>
        Your data is submitted to ADT  Security Services, Inc. (“ADT”) and is hosted and stored in a database on  servers situated in the United States by ADT and by third parties on our behalf.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for ensuring  that the personal information you have submitted or access through the Site is  accurate and complete. You may change the information we have on file for you  by accessing My Account and entering any new or different details. &nbsp;If you have included payment details or credit  card information, you may alter these via the appropriate link on your My  Account page. Please contact us immediately if you notice changes to your  profile that you did not request or if you notice any suspicious activity  concerning your account.</p>
      <p>If you have questions or concerns  regarding this Privacy Statement or about privacy at our Site, you should first  contact ADT by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@adt.com">privacy@adt.com</a> or calling ADT at 1  (800) ADT-ASAP (800-238-2727) and ADT will try to resolve it. &nbsp;If you do not receive acknowledgment of your  inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then  contact TRUSTe at: <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.phpp?page=complaint&amp;url" target="_blank">http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.phpp?page=complaint&amp;url</a>. TRUSTe will then serve  as a liaison with ADT to help resolve your concerns. <br>
        <br>
        TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to  build users' trust and confidence in the internet by promoting the use of fair  information practices. Because ADT wants to demonstrate its commitment to your  privacy, ADT has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its  privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
