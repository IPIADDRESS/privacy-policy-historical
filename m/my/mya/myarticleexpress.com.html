<p align="center"><strong>PRIVACY     POLICY</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>— IMPORTANT — PLEASE READ</strong></p>
<p>This     Privacy Policy describes the terms of our commitment to your privacy.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONS OR     PARTIES COVERED </strong>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover all visitors to     this website, all subscribers to lists or newsletters whether paid or unpaid, all members     or affiliates whether paid or unpaid, and all customers.&nbsp; Persons who visit or view     this website, whether intentionally or unintentionally, whether solicited or unsolicited,     are described herein as “Visitors” and are parties to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;     Subscribers to lists or Newsletters are referred to herein as “Subscribers” and     are parties to the Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Persons who join an organization or marketing     endeavor (e.g. “affiliates”) promoted by this website are called     “Members” herein and are covered by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Finally, anyone     who orders, attempts to order, or receives a product sold (recipients) or advertised on or     delivered from this website, even at no cost, is called a “Customer” herein and     is subject to this Privacy Policy not only by passive acceptance, but by virtue of the     Purchase Agreement contract.&nbsp; The website, its agents, owners, operators, and     employees are referred to collectively herein as “Website,” “Site,”     and/or “Seller”.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONS     EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE STILL COVERED </strong></p>
<p>In     the event that a person excluded from this website because of the Terms of Use or from     denial of service by the website, who nonetheless unlawfully views this site, that person     remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and is in violation of the Terms of     Use.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONS     UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This     website is not lawfully accessible to persons under the age of 18 or who are otherwise     covered by the provisions of the (U.S.) Child Online Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA).&nbsp; If     you are under the age of 18 you must leave this site immediately.&nbsp; Fraudulent use of     this website may make you subject to civil or criminal sanctions.</span></p>
<p><strong>VIEWING     AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Acceptance     of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion of the consideration required for your     right to visit the website.&nbsp; If you do not accept these terms, you have no right to     visit this site and you are fraudulently using this site.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ABOUT     THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED </strong></p>
<p>This     website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and     customers.&nbsp; This information is obtained in various ways, such as:</p>
<p><strong>VISITOR,     SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ‘REGISTRATION’ </strong></p>
<p>Registration     means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to     communicate information to this website.&nbsp; This can include pages or ‘pop ups’ where     you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your     participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website     via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other     membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.</p>
<p>Occasionally     complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form     rather than regular secure merchant service processing.&nbsp; This information is kept at     the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service     provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.</p>
<p><strong>ONLINE     ORDERING</strong></p>
<h4>Shopping Security</h4>
<p>All orders are processed by <a href="http://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank">PayPal</a>,      one of the world’s leading e-commerce companies, using state of the  art encryption, secure     servers, and fraud detection.&nbsp; We use them  as they are able to offer much higher     levels of security than we, as  a small company, could possibly provide.&nbsp; You can have     full  confidence that all information you enter, such as your credit card  details are     entirely safe.</p>
<p>Online     ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting     merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website     but does not provide complete credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of online     ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number,     CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password.&nbsp; You should consider     all this information available to the website.&nbsp; This information is used to deliver     the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general     solicitation purposes.</p>
<p><strong>VISITOR EMAIL     ENQUIRIES </strong></p>
<p>Website visitors     who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions:&nbsp; one, they give     their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any     ‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy     Policy.&nbsp; While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added     to the website’s general solicitation database.</p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMER     EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS </strong></p>
<p>If     you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you communicate with the site     by phone or mail, the website collects information about your communication and by     communicating with the site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and     otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit.</p>
<p>Any     communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be     publicized for commercial purposes.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION     OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS </strong></p>
<p>Visitors     clicking on banners or pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising, appearing on this website must     assume that information is being collected about them.&nbsp; This site is not responsible     for the use of information collected in such a fashion.&nbsp; Visitors must assume that (1) information will be collected, (2) that     ‘cookies’ will usually be placed on their hard drive, (3) that website does not     have any control over what happens with this information, (4) that website takes no     responsibility over the accuracy or content of advertisers, (5) that website is not     responsible for downloads from third party advertisers that contain viruses or worms or     other computer code that causes their computer or software harm, and (6) that website     assumes no responsibility for the data that is garnered from the click itself or that the     advertiser collects.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION     OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS </strong></p>
<p>If     you send a friend an email from this site or if you send the url or one of our web pages     to a friend, you must assume that some data is collected about your IP address or your     email address and that of your friend.&nbsp; You must assume that referred emails or web     pages may appear to come from your email.&nbsp; You must accept fully responsibility for     referring pages or email to a friend and agree to indemnify this site for any damage,     intentional or unintentional that results from said referrals.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION     OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS </strong></p>
<p>Unless     otherwise specified in the survey, you must assume that any information provided to the     website as part of a survey in which you participate may be used for general solicitation     for commercial purposes and that such information will be shared with joint venture     partners, affiliates, marketing organization or used by the site itself for product design     or solicitation purposes.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION     OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND ‘COOKIES’ </strong></p>
<p>Many     websites, including this one, collect information about your computer, your email address,     your IP address.&nbsp; You must assume that your web-viewing or web-use activity is     monitored, tracked, and information collected.&nbsp; This information is not usually of a     personal nature, but it may help define your viewing habits and product preferences even     though the website may or may not have any idea who you are.</p>
<p>“Cookies”     is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your hard drive.&nbsp; Websites use this     to keep you ‘logged in’, to keep track of search criteria, to monitor use, to password     protect use of the site or use of products sold by the site.&nbsp; Cookies can also be     used to obtain information about your computer configuration or your use of your     computer.</p>
<p>Cookies     can be used to electronically gather information about you.&nbsp; Again, it may or may not     be personal information, but it is information and by using this site you are expressly     giving permission to use ‘cookies’ and to use the information gathered from their use to     benefit you.&nbsp; You also give permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and use any     information collected for product design, product offers to you, and general commercial     solicitation purposes by this site or joint venture partners, affiliates, and marketing     organizations.</p>
<p><strong>HOW     INFORMATION MAY BE USED </strong></p>
<p>The     use of information as described below may or may not be how information that is collected     is customarily used by this site.&nbsp; While actual use of any information collected may     be used quite conservatively, you must assume that it is not.&nbsp; You must assume that     information collected is shared with other persons or entities for commercial     purposes.&nbsp; While this is uncommon in practice, you must assume that it is as you make     your decision whether or not to view or interact with this website.&nbsp; This type of     shared information may include your name, address, phone number, email address and buying     habits, as well as other information.&nbsp; This information may be used for general     commercial solicitation by this website or other persons it is sold to, rented to, or     shared with.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION     THAT IS NOT SHARED </strong></p>
<p>Credit     card information or other financial information is not usually known to the website.&nbsp;     However, in the event that it is made known, that information is never revealed to anyone     except to processing authorities or law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; However, the provider     of such information gives express permission to use it in fraud investigation or for     litigation.</p>
<p><strong>BULLETIN     BOARDS AND PUBLIC FORUMS </strong></p>
<p>Visitors,     subscribers, members, or customers who use any site provided bulletin boards or other     public forums, such as chat rooms, do so at their own risk.&nbsp; You may not assume that     the site monitors these services or protects you in any manner from information you post     publicly or share with anyone else via these services.</p>
<p><strong>SPAM </strong></p>
<p>By     providing to this website information that forms the basis of communication with you, such     as an email address, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email     or spam from this website since, by providing such information, you agree to receive     communication from us or other marketing organizations.&nbsp; However, all automated email     communication with you shall contain an ‘unsubscribe’ link where you may notify the     website that you no longer wish to receive solicitations or information from the website     and your name will be removed from the general solicitation database.&nbsp;Emails that     originate in response to a deliberate action on your part (such as an email enquiry, or     the placement of an order) may not contain an ‘unsubscribe link’ since your action will be     taken as an explicit request for such a response, in accordance with thte Terms of Use of     the website.</p>
<p><strong>DATA     SECURITY </strong></p>
<p>This     website takes measures to protect its data that contains information related to you.&nbsp;     However, as a consideration for viewing this site or interacting with this site in any     manner, you waive all claims of any nature against this site concerning the loss,     alteration, or misuse of information.&nbsp; You must assume that it is possible for your     personal data to be obtained by others, such as “hackers,” and used in an     inappropriate manner that may cause you harm and that you agree that the site is not     responsible for damages to you.</p>
