If you elect to post material to any blogs, forums, participate in our social networking features or other community boards that may be offered on our Covered Sites, then such materials will be collected and may be publicly available for others to view.
					<br>
					<br>
					(b)	Cookies.
					(i) Newspaper (or third party service providers on our behalf) may set and access cookies and similar technologies on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Some of our cookies may be local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies. Cookies may be session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).  Newspaper uses cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Covered Sites and in other media. We may use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the sites, to deliver editorial content, to record requests for subscriptions and to personalize information. Our cookies may contain Personally Identifiable Information and such cookies may be shared with others to the same extent indicated in Section 4. Newspaper (or third party service providers on our behalf) may also use cookies to collect aggregate information about web site users on an anonymous basis ("Anonymous Information").  We may share aggregate demographic and usage information with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other third parties for any business purpose.
					(ii) Some of our third party partners (including advertisers and marketing services companies) may set and access cookies and similar technologies on your computer as well, or we may do so on their behalf.  We do not have control over how these third parties use such cookies and similar technologies or the information derived therefrom.
					(iii) If you don't want cookies, most Web browsers include an option that allows you to not accept them. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of our Covered Sites may not function efficiently.  Flash cookies may regenerate HTTP cookies that you have affirmatively deleted.  Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off HTTP cookies as described above will not remove flash cookies.  We use flash cookies as an alternative method to HTTP cookies for storing information about your web browsing history across unaffiliated domains, unrelated to the delivery of content through the Flash Player or the performance of the Flash Player in delivering such content. You can manage and delete flash cookies by visiting <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html.</a>
					<br>
					<br>
					(c)	Gifs.  We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the sites and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message.  A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a web page or message.  A clear gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your Personally Identifiable Information.
					<br>
					<br>
					(d)	IP Address.  Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Covered Sites, the web sites you visit after this web site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this web site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers.  We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, gather broad demographic information, and administer our Covered Sites.  We may also link this information with your Personally Identifiable Information when we feel that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or terms of service or to protect our Covered Sites, customers or others.
					<br>
					<br>
					(e)	Location Information.  We may, and may enable our advertisers to, collect your location via certain services we provide through digital applications, wireless access protocol services ("WAP Services") or mobile phone service ("Mobile Services").

					<br>
					<br>

					<p>(a)	In addition to the other disclosures described in this policy, Newspaper may (and you authorize us to) share or disclose Personally Identifiable Information about you to other companies or individuals in the following situations:

					<br>
					(ii)	You have entered a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, in which case the information you provide via the contest or sweepstakes may be shared by us with that third party for their use in their discretion, including direct marketing.  Some of our contests and sweepstakes will ask you at the time of entry whether you would like to have your personal information shared with the sponsor, in which case we will honor your selection. Other contests will not give you that option and in that event, if you do not want your information to be shared, you should not enter the contest.  The privacy policies of such third party companies apply to their use and disclosure of your information that we collect and disclose to such third party companies.

					<br>
					(viii)	In connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise, including via bankruptcy) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the Covered Site to which this policy applies, in which case the company will possess the Personally Identifiable Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personally Identifiable Information as described in this privacy policy ("Acquisition Exception").
					<br>
					<br>
					(b)	Social Networks.  If you use your login credentials from a social networking site (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) ("SNS") on a Covered Site, we may receive information from such SNS in accordance with the terms and conditions (e.g., terms of use and privacy policy) of the SNS ("SNS Terms").

					<br>
					<br>
					(c)	Third Party Partners.  Some of our Covered Sites may from time to time partner with a retailer or other third party to offer online shopping opportunities, games, services, subscriptions and other applications on a co-branded or cross-promotional basis. Those transactions may take place on a Covered Site, or the site of the third party.

Both we and these companies may use information about your visits to this Covered Site and elsewhere to serve ads and other content to you.  In the course of doing so, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser by such companies.  In addition, we and these companies may use Web beacons to help manage our online advertising and content.

					<p><strong><a id="your_rights">5. Right to Opt-out</a></strong></p>
					<p>(a)	<b><a>California Users: Your California Privacy Rights.</a></b>. California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.  Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing.  We have such a policy in place.  Sections 4(d) and 5(d) explain our practices and how you can opt-out of having your information shared with third parties for the third parties' direct or indirect marketing purposes, in accordance with such laws.  In addition to reviewing Sections 4(d)  and 5(d), if you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you may notify us in writing at 211 N.

Despite your indicated preferences, we may send you service related communications, including notices about your subscription, and we may continue disclosing your information to third parties under the Service Provider Exception, Legal Exceptions, and Acquisition Exception described above.
					<br>
					<br>
					(f)	Device Settings.  Our digital applications may provide you alerts and you can change your preferences regarding these alerts through your device settings.
