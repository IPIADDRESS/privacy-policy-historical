    <p>This is the privacy and cookies policy for www.myjobmatcher.com and any mobile applications we make available from time to time (Site). The Site is operated by My Job Matcher Limited (we, us and our).  For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are the data controller.</p>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy on-line.  We appreciate that you do not want the personal information you provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have.</p>
    <p>By using the Site, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time by changing it on the Site. This privacy policy was last updated on 4 November 2014.</p>
    <p>In addition to this policy, our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Service</a> also apply to your use of the Website and are, where relevant, incorporated by reference into these terms.</p>

    <h2>Information we may collect from you</h2>

Your IP address may be used to identify your location and country of origin, but you cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on the Site and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
