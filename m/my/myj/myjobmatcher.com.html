The Site is operated by My Job Matcher, Inc. (we, us and our). Our registered office is at 310 Alder Road, Dover, Kent, Delaware 19904.</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy on-line. We appreciate that you do not want the personal information you provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have.</p>

    <p>By using the Site, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time by changing it on the Site. This privacy policy was last updated on 4 November 2014.</p>
    <p>In addition to this policy, our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Service</a> also apply to your use of the Website and are, where relevant, incorporated by reference into these terms.</p>

    <h2>Information we may collect from you</h2>

    <p>We may collect and process the following information about you:</p>
    <p>Information (such as your name, email address, postal address and telephone number, resume) that you provide by completing forms on the Site, including if you register as a user of the Site, subscribe to any service, upload or submit any material via the Site, request any information, or enter into any competition or promotion we may sponsor; in connection with an account sign-in facility, your log-in and password details; details of jobs you have been matched with, job you have viewed or any of your job preferences; communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns or comments regarding the Site or its content; information from surveys that we may, from time to time, run on the Site for research purposes, if you choose to respond to, or participate in, them; employment details if you send us a resume or other details of your employment history in connection with an advertised job vacancy or a general enquiry regarding employment opportunities with us.</p>

    <p>When you visit the Site, we may automatically collect additional information about you, such as the type of internet browser you use, any website from which you have come to the Site and your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. Your IP address may be used to identify your location and country of origin, but you cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on the Site and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
