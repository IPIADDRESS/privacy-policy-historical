•<span> </span>Legal, compliance, regulatory and investigative purposes, including for government agencies and law enforcement.<br>
•<span> </span>When you exercise your rights under data protection legislation, including when you ask to subscribe or unsubscribe from our marketing communications.</p>
<p><strong>5. Data sharing</strong></p>
<p>Vue Entertainment is part of the Vue International Group. Details of the Vue International Group can be found on our corporate website at vue-international.com.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Vue Entertainment shares data with other members of the Vue International Group when they provide us with support, advisory, IT, safety and security, including CCTV, and other services.</p>
<p>For certain activities Vue uses third party service providers.&nbsp; When these service providers ask for customer data from us we share the required information with them.</p>
<p>We engage and share your data with third parties for the following services:<br>
•<span> </span>Online advertising and marketing, including delivery of personalised advertisements via email, online or via social media platforms. To achieve this, we share your personal data with <a href="https://movio.co/">Movio Limited</a>, a company that provides marketing services to us and others in the cinema industry. Your personal data is then aggregated with other data and share with other ad-tech service providers such as Liveramp, Google and Facebook, to deliver relevant content to you. &nbsp;<br>
•<span> </span>Wi-Fi&nbsp;<br>
•<span> </span>Customer feedback surveys<br>
•<span> </span>Gift cards (including E-Gifts)&nbsp;<br>
•<span> </span>Loyalty scheme platform<br>
•<span> </span>IT development, support, maintenance and hosting, including the provision of applications and website hosting<br>
•<span> </span>Payments’ processing to enable you to pay by credit or debit card<br>
•<span> </span>CCTV system provision and maintenance</p>
<p>If our business is to be integrated with another business or sold, your details would be shared with our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s advisers (subject to non-disclosure obligations).&nbsp; Your information will be passed to the new owners on completion of the transaction.</p>
<p>Personal data (including CCTV imagery) will be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials for the prevention or detection of crime, if required by law or if required for a legal or contractual claim.</p>
<p><strong>6. International transfers</strong></p>
<p>At times we need to send your data outside of the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (‘EEA’).&nbsp; For example, to follow your instructions, comply with a legal duty or to work with or receive services from our service providers who we use to help run your accounts and our services.</p>
<p>If we do transfer information outside of the EEA, we will make sure that it is protected by using one of these safeguards:<br>
•<span> </span>Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA. Some countries have been deemed adequate by the EU.<br>
•<span> </span>Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA or use other mechanisms and measures to achieve adequate protection. We use the Standard Contractual Clauses published by the EU.<br>
•<span> </span>Transfer it to organisations that are part of Privacy Shield. This is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries. It makes sure those standards are similar to what is used within the EEA.<br>
•<span> </span>Binding corporate rules. These are internal rules adopted by group companies to allow international transfers of personal data to entities within the same corporate group located in countries which do not provide an adequate level of protection.</p>
<p>For service providers in the US, we rely on Privacy Shield.&nbsp; For our service providers in Asia and Oceania, we rely on contractual measures.&nbsp; For further details on the mechanisms used please contact dataprotection@vuemail.com</p>
<p><strong>7. Cookies and similar technologies</strong></p>
<p>Our website, apps and marketing emails use cookies and similar technology. Full information is in our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=593AE8A42E5745259273D141B26B32C2&amp;_z=z">Cookie Policy</a>. This includes information on how to adjust your browser settings to accept or reject cookies.</p>
<p><strong>8. Data retention</strong></p>
<p>We keep your data to enable us to fulfil our contractual and legal obligations to you, to provide services whilst you are an active Vue member or user of our website or app, or where required by law or to protect legal rights.</p>
<p>We always look to keep your data for no longer than it is required in line with data protection principles and our processes.&nbsp; For example, we keep:<br>
•<span> </span>Information on Vue members.<br>
•<span> </span>Records of payment information in line with tax law and audit requirements.<br>
•<span> </span>Customer feedback and correspondence with our customer services teams.&nbsp; This enables us to respond to any questions or complaints.<br>
•<span> </span>Information to maintain records according to applicable laws and rules.<br>
•<span> </span>CCTV imagery for up to 30 calendar days under normal circumstances, after which point it will be deleted. Imagery required for investigative or evidential purposes may be retained beyond 30 days and is securely disposed of upon completion/conclusion of the purpose for which it has been retained.</p>
<p>If you unsubscribe from marketing communications we keep a record of this request indefinitely to ensure we do not send you direct marketing again.</p>
<p>We will retain your data for longer if we cannot delete it for legal, regulatory or technical reasons.</p>
<p><strong>9. Your rights</strong><br>
You have rights over your personal data.</p>
<p>You can:<br>
•<span> </span>ask for your information to be corrected;<br>
•<span> </span>ask for your information to be erased or deleted;<br>
•<span> </span>ask us to limit or restrict processing your data;<br>
•<span> </span>object to us processing your data, in particular where we use the data for direct marketing, including profiling for direct marketing purposes (this right to object does not apply if we must process the data to meet a contractual or legal requirement); and/or<br>
•<span> </span>ask us to send you a copy of the personal information we hold for you in a structured digital format (e.g. USB stick) or ask for us to send it to another party.</p>
<p>Certain rights, however, will be limited. We will be obliged by law to keep certain information.&nbsp; We must respect other people’s privacy as well, which means we will need to redact or remove information where it includes personal data about someone else, even if it is connected to your data.&nbsp; On occasion there could be a compelling legitimate interest to keep processing your data.</p>
<p>If you want to exercise any of your data protection rights, please see ‘Contact details’ below.&nbsp; To process a request from you, we will need to confirm your identity to ensure we’re accessing the right data.</p>
<p>You have a right to complain to an EU data protection authority.&nbsp; In the UK, the authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office (the “ICO”).</p>
<p><strong>10. Contact details</strong></p>

<p><span><strong>Why do we use cookies and similar technologies?</strong><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>To make our websites (including our mobile site) and app work better and to distinguish you from other users, we use cookies and similar technologies, such as tagging.&nbsp; Cookies and similar technologies can perform functions and personalise content.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What is a cookie and what do they do?</strong><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>A cookie is a small text file which sits on your device or browser and assists with information flow and functionality. We use cookies to support the main and mobile websites and our app.&nbsp; For instance, some cookies help with site security or provide information to help us improve the site.&nbsp; Certain cookies can personalise content. Each cookie performs a specific action.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, cookies can send general information about how the site or app is used, which can be used for maintenance and improvement.&nbsp; These cookies don’t capture your personal data and we wouldn’t be able to identify people from the information.&nbsp; They simply log numbers and provide grouped information about site or app navigation – this tells us if people can find what they want.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Other cookies remember information from one page to another, so you don’t have to keep entering it.&nbsp; These are called “session” cookies.&nbsp; For example ASP.Net is a session cookie which remembers your data from one page.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Cookies which remember things for longer, from one visit to the next, are called “persistent” cookies.&nbsp; Persistent cookies can do things like remember preferences and adjust content to suit you (personalisation).<br>
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What are first and third party cookies?</strong><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Cookies can be sent by different parties.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>If the cookie comes from our site it is a first party cookie.&nbsp; If it comes from another site, such as our suppliers or business partners, it is a third-party cookie, specifically chosen by us to provide a service, such as a more personalised visit.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Do I Have to Accept Cookies?</strong><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>You may reject cookies; however, site and app functions will be affected.&nbsp; Cookies help our sites and app to work properly and personalise your experience. You’ll be able to browse the sites and app without cookies but some standard functionality, preferences and certain features will not work.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>By accepting cookies, you allow us to improve your experience and remember information about you, which can personalise your experience.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>To withdraw consent, you can reject or delete cookies. Please see the Managing Your Cookies section below on how you can adjust your browser settings.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Consent</strong><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>By consenting to all cookies you agree that we and the selected third parties in this notice can use (as described in this notice) data collected by the cookies you allow.&nbsp; If you do not agree, you can withdraw your consent at any time by managing your cookies in the links below. This will not include ‘Strictly Necessary Cookies’ that are required for this site to function.&nbsp;<br>
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Managing Your Cookies</strong><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>You can manage your cookie settings using this link&nbsp;</span><a class="optanon-toggle-display dl_Anchor" href="#" style="color: #00b3ff;">Manage Cookie Settings</a>&nbsp;or through managing settings in your browser.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201265">Safari</a></span></p>
<p><span>There are several ways to manage cookies. You can:<br>
1. set your browser to prevent cookies from being accepted.&nbsp; More information should be in your browser’s “help” menu. How to adjust your browser will depend on which browser you’re using.<br>
2. set some browsers to send you an alert when a website is trying to place a cookie on your browser.<br>
3. block cookies by activating the setting on your browser to refuse all or some cookies.&nbsp; However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies including strictly necessary cookies, site access and features can be limited or not available.<br>
4. delete cookies stored in your browser by “clearing cookies”.&nbsp; This will only delete cookies already stored.&nbsp; It won’t prevent new ones being accepted unless you change the acceptance settings.&nbsp; Also, clearing your cookies on one browser of one device does not automatically clear them on another.&nbsp; You need to clear all browsers on all devices, independently.<br>
5. refuse specific cookies, by using that cookie’s opt-out process, in the table at the end of this notice.<br>
6. opt out of the use of cookies by Disney, who we partner with to bring you advertising about the latest Disney movies, by clicking <a href="https://privacy.thewaltdisneycompany.com/en/current-privacy-policy/cookies-policy/">here</a>.

</span></p>
<p><span>Please bear in mind that if you restrict or disable cookies it can limit functionality and prevent sites from working properly at all.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>How long do cookies last?</strong><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Different cookies can last for different lengths of time.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Session cookies last for that website visit.&nbsp; Information is kept from one page to another, so you don’t have to keep entering it.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Persistent cookies are on your browser and may last for a year or until you delete them.&nbsp; They can personalise the site and remember information each time you visit.&nbsp; We use them to see how people engage with our site.&nbsp; It helps us change and develop the site and improve your experience of it.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What different types of cookies does the site use and what are they each for?</strong><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Different types of cookies do different things.&nbsp; We use the following cookies on our sites and apps.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Strictly Necessary Cookies support our websites and app operation.&nbsp; They are essential when you move around our website or app and use its features. For example, they remember your details when you login.&nbsp; This allows you to access your account. Without such cookies such services cannot be provided.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Analytical/Performance Cookies collect anonymous information on how people use the website or app, which helps us develop these. We can see if people find things easily and improve site navigation.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Functionality Cookies remember you when you return to the site or app and choices you have made on previous visits, such as searches and which country you’re from.&nbsp; This allows us to personalise our content for you, such as enabling us to remember your preferences.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What are similar technologies?</strong><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Tagging works in a similar way to cookies.&nbsp; We use a tag called a pixel.&nbsp; A pixel is an image that once imbedded in an email connects to a file stored on our web server and allows us to determine customer interest in our marketing emails.&nbsp; Tags can also be known as beacons.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>These allow us to see which promotions seem of interest to our customers, and if a particular offer seems to interest you.&nbsp; We may use this information to send offers which appear to be more relevant to you.</span></p>

<p><strong>4.<span> </span>Collecting your tickets&nbsp;</strong><br>
1.<span> </span>Once you have booked your tickets online, you can collect them from the box office at your chosen cinema. Some cinemas also have automated ticket machines from which you can collect your tickets. If you have purchased a concession ticket, you may not be able to use the automated ticket machines because our staff may want to check your proof of identity before you are admitted. The cardholder must be present to collect the tickets, and you will need to take the same card as you have used to make your booking. If your tickets are for a 3D film, and you have ordered 3D glasses, you will receive a voucher for your 3D glasses when you collect your tickets. You can take your 3D glasses voucher to any designated collection point in the cinema to collect your 3D glasses before the film.<br>
2.<span> </span>For tickets delivered to your mobile phone or computer as a QR barcode, please note that the person receiving the barcode is considered to be the rightful ticket holder and such barcode ticket can only be used once. You will be able to enter your screening without having to visit an ATM or counter if your confirmation email confirms that your barcode can be read by a member of staff at a gate. Please note that if you have pre-purchased food and beverage with your tickets you will still need to go to a counter to collect your order.</p>
<p><strong>5.<span> </span>Concession tickets&nbsp;</strong><br>
1.<span> </span>Photographic identification for any concession tickets (including students) purchased through the Site or the Booking Line may be requested upon collection of the tickets and/or at the point of admission to the auditorium.<br>
2.<span> </span>In the event that appropriate photographic identification cannot be produced upon request, you will be required to pay the difference between the concession price and the applicable full ticket price.</p>

Modern Slavery statement
</div>
<div class="collapse__content">
<div class="collapse__wrapper">
<div class="container container-tiny generic-content__text written-content">
<div>This statement, made in accordance with section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, sets out the policies adopted and steps taken by Vue International to:</div>
<ul class="list">
<li>assess the risk of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within our business or supply chain;&nbsp;</li>
<li>prevent any instances of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within our own business;&nbsp; and</li>
<li>ensure that every supplier with whom we do business is taking appropriate steps to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking does not occur within their business (or their own supply chain).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this statement, the term “Vue International” refers to Vue International Holdco Limited and all of its subsidiaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our business, structure and supply chain</strong></p>
<p>Vue International is one of the world's leading cinema operators, managing a number of the most respected brands in major European markets and Taiwan, spanning ten countries, 212 sites and 1,902 screens. The group has leading positions in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of our brands is operated as a separate business unit, with local management in each jurisdiction reporting to the group head office located in London.</p>
<p>Our suppliers and contractors include providers of food, drinks, uniforms, technical equipment, cleaning and facilities management services, property maintenance and construction services and other professional service providers (such as architects, lawyers, accountants and auditors).</p>
<p><strong>Group policy statement</strong></p>
<p>Vue International does not and will not tolerate modern slavery or human trafficking in any aspect of our business, and holds each of its suppliers to the same zero-tolerance standard (regardless of the nature, scale or jurisdiction of their business).</p>
<p><strong>Supplier diligence&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In the financial year ending 30 November 2017 Vue International adopted a revised group procurement policy, which is being rolled out across the group’s operating territories in the 2018 financial year.&nbsp; The policy requires that, before being engaged to provide any goods or services to any part of our business, any potential supplier must provide us with (among other things):</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>confirmation that no instance of modern slavery or human trafficking has occurred (or is occurring) within their business;</li>
<li>information about the steps they have taken to ensure that no modern slavery or human trafficking has occurred (or is occurring) within their own supply chain; and</li>
<li>such further information or evidence as we may reasonably request in relation to that potential supplier’s policies and processes in relation to modern slavery or human trafficking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The information provided will be assessed by our Head of Group Procurement (in the case of group-wide supplier arrangements) or the local Head of Procurement or Head of Retail (in the case of territory-specific supplier arrangements), who will form a view as to whether the potential supplier has appropriate and robust modern slavery and human trafficking policies and procedures in place.&nbsp; Where necessary, we will request further evidence or information or will arrange for site visits to inspect the manufacturing facilities of individual suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that we are not able to satisfy ourselves as to the modern slavery and human trafficking policies or procedures of a potential supplier, we will not conduct any business with that supplier.&nbsp; &nbsp;Were we to discover any evidence, or have cause for suspicion, that any instance of modern slavery or human trafficking has occurred with any of our existing suppliers, we would report this to the appropriate legal authorities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Where any member of the Vue International group enters into a contract with any supplier for the provision of goods and services, we will always seek to ensure that such contract contains an obligation on the supplier to comply with applicable modern slavery and human trafficking prevention laws and regulations, and to maintain appropriate and robust policies and procedures in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>Supply chain risk analysis&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Generally, we consider the risk of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within our supply chain to be low.&nbsp; The principal reasons for this are that:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>the large majority of our suppliers are large international organisations with comparatively robust and sophisticated prevention and compliance policies (overseen by professional compliance teams) in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking;&nbsp; and</li>
<li>many of our suppliers operate in industries which receive a relatively high degree of independent regulatory scrutiny (for example, our suppliers in the food and drink supply and manufacturing industry).</li>
</ul>
<p>If however we identify a supplier (or potential supplier) with higher risk characteristics in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking, they will be subjected to a higher degree of scrutiny as part of the Vue International procurement process.&nbsp; Characteristics indicating a need for such enhanced scrutiny may include:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>the smaller scale of the supplier’s business meaning that their internal policies and processes in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking are less well developed;</li>
<li>the operation of manufacturing or processing facilities by a supplier in countries with higher levels of estimated modern slavery (as determined by the Global Slavery Index 2016); or</li>
<li>a supplier’s reliance on supply chains with considerable geographic or operational complexity, resulting in challenges for consistent application and monitoring of relevant policies.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effectiveness of the policies and strategies</strong></p>
<p>At no time since its formation has Vue International encountered, or been the subject of any allegations or complaints of, any occurrence of modern slavery or human trafficking within its business or supply chain.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst this is encouraging, we acknowledge that we have a continuing obligation to ensure that our relevant policies and strategies remain fit for purpose as the scale of our business and operations develops over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Staff awareness and training&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Vue International has adopted a whistle-blowing policy, details of which are available to all members of staff.&nbsp; This policy details how any member of staff with concerns about a potential issue (including potential occurrences of modern slavery or human trafficking) should bring the matter to the attention of senior management.&nbsp; This includes an option to raise the matter through a confidential whistle-blowing hotline and email contact address.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our policy development goals for the 2018 financial year is to increase awareness of, and engagement in, specific modern slavery and human trafficking issues and risks among our employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst we encourage all of our employees to raise any concerns or queries they may have in relation to potential misconduct of any kind, we accept that we could always do more to make our employees aware of the specific role they have in preventing slavery and human trafficking, and helping us to implement our policies and processes in that regard.</p>
<p>Proposals currently under consideration include:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>rolling out a program of training sessions (either in person or online) in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking for all new and existing employees;&nbsp;</li>
<li>including information in relation to our employees’ role in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking in new starter induction training; and</li>
<li>increasing the quality and visibility of the modern slavery and human trafficking information available on our group intranet site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Continuing development</strong></p>
<p>We are constantly looking to update our policies (including modern slavery and human trafficking prevention policies and processes) to reflect the most recent standards of best practice.&nbsp; Our key goals for the 2018 financial year include:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>embedding our revised group procurement policy throughout the Vue International group and ensuring consistent&nbsp; implementation of this policy in all jurisdictions and business areas;</li>
<li>updating our employee handbook to include details of employees’ specific rights and responsibilities in relation to the prevention of modern slavery and human trafficking;</li>
<li>increasing employee engagement in, and awareness of, their role in preventing modern slavery and human trafficking within our business and supply chain; and</li>
<li>ensuring that all new supplier agreements we enter into contain adequate provision in respect of supplier compliance with modern slavery and human trafficking law and regulation.</li>

<br>
6.<span> </span>Our use of your photograph: If you submit a photograph for inclusion in the Campaign, we may include your photograph in the Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Photo Mosaic (“Mosaic”), which can be viewed online at <a href="http://starwarsmemories.myvue.com">starwarsmemories.myvue.com</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(“Campaign Site”). Visitors to the Campaign Site will be able to search the Mosaic by name to find the photograph featuring the named person. We may also include your photograph in a short video montage of fan photographs that will be shown in Vue cinemas immediately prior to showings of the movie Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (“Fan Montage”). In return for the chance for your photograph to be featured in the Mosaic and/or the Fan Montage:<br>
<br>
a.<span> </span>you hereby grant to Vue, and our group companies, affiliates and agents (and our successors and assigns) (“Released Parties”) the right (without obligation) to use, publish, reproduce, display, exhibit or otherwise exploit your photograph in the Mosaic and the Fan Montage and in any other advertising, marketing, promotional and public relations materials relating to the Campaign in any and all media worldwide, for a period unlimited in time commencing on the date of submission;<br>
<br>
b.<span> </span>you hereby agree that your photograph may be combined with text, music, sound, graphics and other content, and cut, altered, modified, cropped, edited or dubbed into another language at our entire discretion and without your approval except that the use of the photograph in the Campaign will not represent you in a derogatory manner;<br>
<br>
c.<span> </span>you hereby agree that we shall have the right (without obligation) to use your name in connection with the photograph (including in connection with the search functionality that allows Campaign Site visitors to search for specific photographs in the Mosaic by name);&nbsp;<br>
<br>
d.<span> </span>you hereby waive any right to receive further compensation (in money or money’s worth) for the use of your photograph; and<br>

e.<span> </span>you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive, in favour of the Released Parties, all moral rights, performers’ rights and similar rights arising under the laws of any jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
7.<span> </span>Inclusion of photographs: There is a limited number of slots available in the Mosaic (approximately 1,000) and the Fan Montage (approximately 25-30) and therefore the chances of your photograph being included in the Mosaic and/or Fan Montage will depend to an extent on the number of submissions received. You acknowledge that submission of your photograph is no guarantee that your photograph will appear in the Mosaic and/or Fan Montage and the inclusion of any photograph in the Mosaic and/or Fan Montage shall be at the absolute discretion of Vue, whose decisions shall be final.&nbsp;<br>

Your access to and use of any social networking platform shall at all times remain subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant platform. All third party trade marks and other rights are hereby acknowledged.<br>
<br>
10.<span> </span>Interference with the Campaign: Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the content or legitimate operation of the Campaign is prohibited and may be a violation of criminal and/or civil laws and in these circumstances we reserve all our rights and remedies.<br>
<br>
11.<span> </span>Cancellation and variation: We reserve the right to vary, suspend or cancel the Campaign and/or these Terms if we consider it necessary or appropriate to do so, including if there is any actual or anticipated breach of applicable law or if variation, suspension or cancellation is necessary due to an event outside our reasonable control.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
12.<span> </span>Disqualification: Without limiting the options available to us, we reserve the right at any time to disqualify any person from participating in the Campaign if we regard them as being in breach of these Terms or any applicable laws or third party terms and conditions referred to in these Terms.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
13.<span> </span>Liability: To the fullest extent permissible by law, the Released Parties exclude all liability for any loss or damage of any kind arising from the Campaign and any person’s participation in it.

•<span> </span>To enter the Competition all you need to do is complete and submit the survey form on the Site (www.yourtriptovue.com.com) during the Entry Period.

In these circumstances, the entrant acknowledges that the Promoter may nevertheless disclose such information in full to the UK Advertising Standards Authority and/or the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland (as applicable) if required to do so.

•<span> </span>Discretion: Where these Terms refer to the exercise of any discretion by Vue such discretion shall be absolute and no correspondence shall be entered into regarding any associated decisions.&nbsp;<br>
•<span> </span>Events Beyond our Control: Events may occur that render the Competition itself or the selection of a winner impractical due to reasons beyond Vue’s control. We may, at our discretion, make such variations or amendments to the Competition as we feel are necessary as a result of such events.<br>
•<span> </span>Cancellation of the Competition: Vue reserves the right to vary, cancel or suspend the Competition or these Terms in whole or in part at any time if we consider it necessary or appropriate to do so, including if there is any actual or anticipated breach of applicable law or if variation, cancellation or suspension is necessary due to an event outside our reasonable control. We will not have any liability, whether to you or to any third party, as a result of such actions.<br>
•<span> </span>Disqualification: Without limiting the options available to us, we reserve the right at any time to disqualify any person from participating in the Competition if we regard them as being in breach of these Terms or any applicable laws or any other terms and conditions referred to in these Terms.<br>

•<span> </span>Severability and Waiver: Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any term of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that provision.<br>
•<span> </span>Third Party Rights: These Terms relate to an agreement between you and Vue. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of these Terms.&nbsp;<br>
•<span> </span>Accessing these Terms: Any website on which these Terms are posted is only intended to be accessed from England, Wales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
