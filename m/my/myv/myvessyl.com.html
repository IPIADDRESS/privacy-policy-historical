<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 15, 2014.</p>
</header>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Our Policy</h2>
<p>
Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Mark One Lifestyle, Inc. (“Mark
One”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Mark One and has
been created to provide information about Mark One and our products and
services (together with the Site, the “Services”) to our Service visitors
(“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Mark One’s policy with
respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal
Data”) and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site
and Services.
</p>
</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal
Data and other information from you, as further described below:
</p>
<h3>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</h3>
<p>
We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such
information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one
of our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain
Services.  Wherever Mark One collects Personal Data we make an effort to
provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to
our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide
Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such
Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the
offices and servers of Mark One and the authorized third parties
referred to herein located in the United States.
</strong>
</p>
<h3>Other Information:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Non-Identifiable Data:</strong>
When you interact with Mark One through the Services, we receive and
store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such
information, which is collected passively using various technologies,
cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Mark One may
store such information itself or such information may be included in
databases owned and maintained by Mark One affiliates, agents or
service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it
with other information to track, for example, the total number of
visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our
Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service
providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available
or used in this process.
</p>
<p>
In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies."
A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our
Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our
cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and
help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our
Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access
the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password
more than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which
we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your
permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on
the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to
receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to
turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on
because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service
features.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong>
In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the
Services, Mark One often conducts research on its customer
demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and
other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and
analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Mark One may share this aggregate
data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This
aggregate information does not identify you personally. Mark One may
also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our
services to current and prospective business partners, and to other
third parties for other lawful purposes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Location Information:</strong>
Our Service may collect and use your location information (for
example, by using the GPS on your mobile device) to provide certain
functionality of our Service. If you choose to enable our location
features, your location information may be publicly displayed within
the Service. Please keep in mind that other users can see this
information about you, and they may use it or disclose it to other
individuals or entities outside of our control and without your
knowledge. Your location information may be subject to abuse, misuse,
and monitoring by others, so please be careful if you choose to
enable location functionality. We may also use your location
information in an aggregate way, as described above in the
“Aggregated Personal Data” section.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h2>
<p>
Mark One uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is
consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a
certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the
reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by
email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question
or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to
obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide
you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such
services. Mark One and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Mark One
Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally
non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us
improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better
understand our users and to improve the Services. Mark One and its
affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell
you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so,
each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions
permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications.
In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing
communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing
lists, please contact us as indicated below.
</p>
<p>
If Mark One intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not
consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such
anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is
collected.
</p>
</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h2>
<p>
Mark One is not in the business of selling your information. We consider
this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There
are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal
Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set
forth below:
</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or
assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization,
dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the
transferred assets.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Related Companies:</strong>
We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for
purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong>
Mark One, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to
perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such
functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and
processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a
function of this nature, we only provide them with the information
that they need to perform their specific function.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Legal Requirements:</strong>
Mark One may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law
or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i)
comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or
property of Mark One, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect
the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv)
protect against legal liability.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<p>
You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose
not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain
Services.
</p>
</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Exclusions</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Mark
One other than Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy
Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Mark
One through the Services or through any other means. This includes, but
is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the
Services, such as forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to
existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively,
“Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed
to be non-confidential and Mark One shall be free to reproduce, use,
disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without
limitation or attribution.
</p>
</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>
Mark One does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the
age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any
Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal
guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce
our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide
Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have
reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal
Data to Mark One through the Services, please contact us, and we will
endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
</p>
</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may
contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Mark One
(the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here
do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not
imply that Mark One endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We
suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy
policies.
</p>
</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Integrating Social Networking Services</h2>
<p>
One of the special features of the Service is that it allows you to
enable or log in to the Services via various social networking services
like Facebook or Twitter (“Social Networking Service(s)”). By directly
integrating these services, we make your online experiences richer and
more personalized. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to
log into or grant us permission via the relevant Social Networking
Service. When you add a Social Networking Services account to the Service
or log into the Service using your Social Networking Services account, we
will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to
access that Social Networking Service and your data contained within that
Social Networking Service.  As part of such integration, the Social
Networking Service will provide us with access to certain information
that you have provided to the Social Networking Service, and we will use,
store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy
Policy.  However, please remember that the manner in which Social
Networking Services use, store and disclose your information is governed
by the policies of such third parties, and Mark One shall have no
liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of
any Social Networking Services that may be enabled within the Service.
</p>
<p>
You may also have the option of posting your Services activities to
Social Networking Services when you access content through the Services
(for example, you may post to Facebook that you performed an activity on
the Service); you acknowledge that if you choose to use this feature,
your friends, followers and subscribers on any Social Networking Services
you have enabled will be able to view such activity.
</p>
</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
Mark One takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via
the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is
ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the
Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in
deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in
mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Mark One via the Internet.
</p>
</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Other Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>
Your access to and use of the Services is subject to the Terms of Service

</section>
<section class="legal-section">
<h2>Changes to Mark One’s Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result,
at times it may be necessary for Mark One to make changes to this Privacy
Policy. Mark One reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy
Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please
review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any
Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated
above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions
to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of
such revised Privacy Policy.
