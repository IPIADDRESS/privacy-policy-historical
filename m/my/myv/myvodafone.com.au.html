<h3>Can you access and correct the personal information we hold about you?</h3>
<p>Yes, but there may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, we may not grant access to information if it could interfere with the privacy of others or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.&nbsp;</p>
