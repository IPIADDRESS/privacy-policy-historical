                visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and
                mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. We may also collect technical
                information to help us identify your device for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes.
            </p>

                <b>Mobile:</b>
                When you download or use apps created by Mamba or World of Dating Ltd or our subsidiaries,
                we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique
                identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based

                <b>E-mail Communications:</b>
                To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when
                you open e-mail from Mamba or World of Dating Ltd if your computer supports such
                capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies,
                in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Information from Other Sources:</b>
                We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account
                information. Examples of information we receive from other sources include account

                companies with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical,
                fulfillment, advertising, or other services.

            <em>Cookies</em>
            <p>
                Cookies are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognise you
                as our Website customer if you return to our Website using the same computer and browser.
                We send a "session cookie" to your computer if and when you log in to your account by
                entering your email address and password or otherwise use Communications. These cookies
                allow us to recognise you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session,
                so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close
                your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your email address
                on our log-in form, so that you don't have to retype your email address each time you log
                in to your account. We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information
                stored in them.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also use cookies to customise the Communications, content, and advertising; to measure
                promotional effectiveness, and to promote trust and safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                Non-personal data may be gathered on our behalf using cookies, log file data, and code
                that is embedded on our Website by specific third party partners. We use this non-personal
                information to help improve the services we provide to you. The non-personal data gathered
                is used to provide anonymised statistical information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting
                new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
                disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by
                browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the
                website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our
                essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block

                information you provided to us and the benefits of the above mentioned rights to our
                partners and eventual successors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Financial Information:</b>
                Neither Mamba, nor World of Dating Ltd store your financial information or credit card
                details. Please, note that financial information and credit card details will be stored by
                a company, processing your credit card payments, if you choose our “Pay in one click” option.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b>
                We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                include providing applications, sending postal mail and e- mail, analyzing data, providing
                marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.
                They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use
                it for other purposes. For example, a company, processing your credit card payments will
                store your name and credit card details to let you use our “Pay in 1 click” option in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Promotional Offers:</b>
                Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of our Website customers on behalf of other
                businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you
                do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your “E-mail Notification” preferences
                in the “Settings” menu of your account.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Business Transfers:</b>
                As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other websites, subsidiaries,
                or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the
                transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre- existing
                Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely
                event that Mamba, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will
                of course be one of the transferred assets. Mamba and World of Dating Ltd may occasionally
                share general socio-demographic information that does not include names with selected partners
                to allow them to target their announcements (by age category, gender, etc.). In this case,
                we will not send these partners any information that would allow them to identify you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Protection of Mamba, World of Dating Ltd and Others:</b>
                We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate
                to comply with the law; enforce or apply these Terms and Conditions and other agreements;
                or protect the rights, property, or safety of Mamba, World of Dating Ltd, our users,
                or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
                for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include
                selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from
                customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this clause.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>With Your Consent:</b>
                Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go
                to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
            </p>
        </li>

            <em>How Secure Is Information About Me?</em>
            <p>
                We are committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information
                security. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce
                physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorise access to personal
                information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
                certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential.
                We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
                Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security
                of your data transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have
                received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent
                unauthorised access.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Where we store your personal data</em>
            <p>
                The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a location
                outside the European Economic Area ('EEA'). It may also be processed by staff located
                outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers (for example, staff who are
                involved in providing services that you order from us, processing your payment details or
                providing support services for the Website). By submitting your personal data to us through
                the Website, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps
                reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this clause.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Which Information Can I Access?</em>
            <p>
                Mamba and World of Dating Ltd give you access to a broad range of information about your
                account for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.
                Examples of information you can access easily at the Website include personally identifiable
                information (including name, e-mail, sex, age, photographs and place where you live);
                e-mail notification settings.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>What Choices Do I Have?</em>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might
                    be needed to take advantage of Communications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can add or update certain information in the “Settings” menu of your account. There you
                    can correct your name, e-mail address, phone number, change your password. When you update
                    information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the “Settings” menu of your account you can also change your notification preferences.
                    If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust “E-mail Notification”
                    preferences in the “Settings” menu of your account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you no longer wish for Mamba and World of Dating Ltd or our partners to reproduce or
                    broadcast the information comprised in your personal ad, your search criteria, or your
                    profile, you can terminate your Website account by choosing “Delete your profile” in the
                    “Settings” menu of your account. Since this information is comprised of your personal ad,
                    your search criteria and your profile, the termination will only take effect upon the next
                    update or version of these communications (printed, press, audiovisual, or electronic)
                    containing your personal ad, your search criteria and your profile information.

            <em>Are Children Allowed to Use the Website?</em>
            <p>
                Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (persons under the age
                of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use our services.

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mamba shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and immediately remove, cancel or
            suspend access to and use of the Website upon your breach of any part of these Terms
            whatsoever, which shall be at its sole discretion.
        </li>
        <li>Termination shall be without prejudice to the accrued rights of either party.</li>
        <li>
            Mamba shall not be liable in any way whatsoever for failure to perform any obligation under
            this Agreement, should such failure be caused by the occurrence of any unforeseen contingency
            beyond the reasonable control of such party, including but not limited to Internet outages,
            communications outages, fire, flood, war or acts of God.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In the event that any part of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, such part, at Mamba’s
            discretion, shall be construed as far as possible to reflect the intentions of either
            yourself as the user or Mamba and the remainder of the provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
        </li>
        <li>
            These Terms constitute the entire Agreement between yourself as the user and Mamba and shall
            apply to the exclusion of all other terms of contract which you may purport to propose.
        </li>
        <li>
            These Terms are governed and construed in accordance with Russian legislation. Those issues
            which are not settled by these Terms are subject to Russian legislation.
        </li>
        <li>
            In case any disputes or differences arise in connection with the fulfillment of these Terms,
            yourself and Mamba shall make every effort to resolve these by way of negotiation. Those
            disputes which are not resolved by negotiation shall be resolved according to the procedure
            established by effective Russian legislation.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the case where you use paid services of the Website or recharge your account on the Website,
            Mamba is entitled to award additional bonus money to your account. Some of your actions may
            lead to the accrual of bonus money, and the amount of credited bonuses is determined solely
            by Mamba and can be changed by it unilaterally with the placement of information about it
            on the Website. Bonus money can be used to pay for the services of the Website. Mamba may
            impose restrictions on the use of bonus money, including a limited range of services for
            which payment is possible with the use of bonus money.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have a positive balance on your account on the Website and you do not use the Website’s
            paid services within three months, you recognize this request, addressed to Mamba, to exchange
            the balance money to an equal amount of bonus money.
