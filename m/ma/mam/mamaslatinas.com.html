<p>
At MamásLatinas, CMI Marketing, Inc. d/b/a MamásLatinas ("MamásLatinas") is committed to maintaining your privacy and your trust. This
Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information about you when you use the MamásLatinas website (the "Site"). We hope this
information increases your confidence in MamásLatinas and enhances your experience on our Site. Each time that you use the Site, you signify that you

</p>
<p>
<strong>I. ABOUT MAMÁSLATINAS </strong>
</p>
<p>
MamásLatinas.com is an online service for moms that allows our mom members to set up unique personal profiles and through those profiles to create an
online network of other moms and join in conversation. Site members ("Members") can view each other's profiles, communicate with old friends and make new
friends on the Site, share photos and videos, play games, create and post in groups, comment on blog posts, and more. To enrich our Members' experience, we
request and display some personal information to other Members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of
friends. Site members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other Members and MamásLatinas communicates with them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>From Members</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
MamásLatinas collects information from you when you register with our Site, update your profile, interact with other Members and non-Member users, and
use various features of our Site. To register with the Site, we ask you to provide your name, birthdate, zip code and email address, and select a screen
name and password. Once you are registered you will be given the option to add additional information about you and your family to your profile.
</p>
<p>
We also collect information regarding your activities on the Site, including interaction with other users and your use of the Site. From time to time we
may ask you to respond to surveys or other similar requests for information and we collect any information you may provide. We collect information from you
when you participate in sweepstakes, games or other promotions offered on our Site. We may also collect information about you through other methods,
including research surveys or information we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data services, as well as public sources.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>From All Users</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
Like most standard Website servers, we collect information from all visitors to the Site. We collect this information using a variety of methods, including
weblogs, cookies, web beacons, widgets and the like. The information we collect includes, but is not limited to, the browser you are using and the language
the browser is set to, the internet address from which you linked to our Site, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer
you used to access our Site, and usage and browsing habits on the Site.
</p>
<p>
Cookies we utilize on the Site may include session ID cookies, persistent cookies, or more advanced technology such as HTML5 or Media Stamp. A session ID
cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent
cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. You may configure your browser to prevent cookies from being set on your
computer. If you reject cookies you may still use the Site but your ability to use some areas of the Site may be limited and you may not be able to use
certain features of the Site, including playing games or entering sweepstakes or contests.
</p>
<p>
Similar cookies and other technologies are used by our advertising partners, which may also include Flash cookies, which are a form of persistent cookies
technically called "Local Shared Objects" (LSOs). Flash cookies are set through a mechanism in Adobe Flash Player. With Flash cookies your data is stored
in multiple places and it may be restored once you delete it. Please check with your browser's site on the most updated information on how to delete Flash
cookies. HTML5 or Media Stamp technology has a local storage feature that, when used, allows for quicker access to a website upon a return visit. HTML5 is
currently supported by some mobile devices and desktop browsers. HTML5 Media Stamp data is not stored in a browser's "cookies" file.
</p>
<p>
Our Web pages and our e-mail newsletters contain web beacons (also known as pixel tags). These web beacons allow us to count users that have visited a web
page or opened an email that contains a web beacon and collect other types of information. Some of the web beacons that are in place on our Site are used
only by MamásLatinas, and other web beacons are from our vendors and advertisers who use this data to assist us in analyzing how our Members use the
Site. In addition, we have agreements with various affiliate networks that promote the Site on their affiliate websites. These affiliate advertisers may
use web beacons in their advertisements to track users who click through from the affiliate website to the Site.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the foregoing, the Site provides search functionality and we collect the searches conducted on the Site by a user and may combine that
information with other information from such user.
</p>
<p>
<strong>III. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the information we collect that is associated with a single user or Member, or combined in the aggregate is known as
"Data." We keep Data no longer than necessary for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.
</p>
<p>
<strong>General Use of Site. </strong>
We use the Date we collect, including both Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and non-PII in both aggregated and individual forms, to provide the
Site and Site support. We may process and use this Data for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy including, but not limited to:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
Customize, measure, and improve the Site design and optimization, and the content and advertising provided through it, which include research and
development;
</li>
<li>
Enforce our Terms of Service and detect fraud and other illegal activities;
</li>
<li>
Let you know about new products or services from us or other companies we work with as well as promotional offers, based on your preference settings;
</li>
<li>
Evaluate potential inclusion in the Site's influencer program;
</li>
<li>
Let you know about changes to the Site, the Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, and other terms that apply to our Site; and
</li>
<li>
Update any programs or other tools that we provide in conjunction with the Site.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition we may combine the Data we have collected with similar types of data provided by third parties for similar purposes. We use this Data to create a better Site and better user experience, as well as to help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, to analyze trends,
track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may use this Data in these forms for internal business purposes, such as
determining how much traffic certain portions of the Site receive, for license reporting and assessment of service levels, to better understand how the
Site is used, to gauge traffic patterns and determine what types of content and services are most popular with users of the Site, or determining which
search queries are the most popular.
</p>
<p>
Using this Data, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Site. This allows us to learn what pages are most
attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Site are the most interesting and what kind of offers our Members like to see.
</p>
<p>
We use cookies to differentiate users of the Site from Members, to customize the content of certain sections of the Site and to enable us to track and
cater to the interests of users, in order to enhance their experience on the Site. For example, we may use such Data to determine which blogs, articles, or
games to recommend to you. We may also use Data we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.
</p>
<p>
We may use a Member's registration information to verify that you are the person authorized to use the Site or to manage your account.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When you Register.</strong>
When you register with MamásLatinas, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your screen name and
photo, are displayed as specified in your privacy settings to allow you to connect with other MamásLatinas Members or to all users of the Site. Your
real name is never displayed on the Site (unless you use it as your screen name), but your real name will be included in emails that you "send to a
friend." You can choose to allow Members and non-Member users to search for you by using your real name or most other information you have entered in your
profile.
</p>
<p>
Please be aware that certain personal profile information is displayed for all users and cannot be hidden. Specifically, your screen name and photo are
always displayed on the Site and therefore are viewable by all users. In addition, because this information is publicly displayed on the Site it may appear
in the results of searches conducted on Internet search engines.
</p>
<p>
By using the search functionality on the Site MamásLatinas Members can find other moms with similar interests and challenges. When you find other
Members, you can view their personal profiles to find out more about them based on the information they have decided to share on the Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing of Information. </strong>
We use third parties to assist us in delivering parts of the Site to you. We may share portions of your Data with these third parties to the extent
necessary for them to provide these services. As described in more detail below, we may also provide Non-PII elements of your Data to third parties who
deliver ads to you on our behalf. We will not provide your PII to these advertisers unless you expressly authorize us to do so.
</p>
<p>
We may also share weblog data and other similar non-PII Data with third parties. For example, we may share traffic data for the Site with a third party
that analyzes and publishes Website traffic surveys.
</p>
<p>
You may authorize other Internet sites such as Facebook to access and publish on their websites some of your Data, including your activity on the Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Advertisements.</strong>
We, or advertising network providers acting at our request, may deliver advertisements to you through the Site, depending on whether you are a registered
user or not, as described in more detail below.
</p>
<p>
<u>Non-Member Users</u>
</p>
<p>
We, or our advertising providers, automatically deliver ads to all users of the Site, whether they are registered or not, based on non-personal information
including: (i) the IP address associated with your computer for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location; (ii) the type of web page
that is being displayed, such as a news or games page, for example; or (iii) the content on the page that is shown, such as a news article about a certain
movie. This advertising activity automatically applies to all users and it is purely contextual.
</p>
<p>
<u>Members</u>
</p>
<p>
If you are a Member, we may use your Data, regardless of where we gathered such information, to determine what type of ad to display to you on the Sites.
In addition, we may send certain demographic information, like ZIP code, age, and gender to our advertising network providers, so that the advertising you
see is more relevant to you. These advertising network providers will only use such information to display an ad to you on the Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Ad Servers.</strong>
We may use third party advertising technology to serve ads when you visit our Site. We may from time to time use various outside ad-serving companies to
serve advertisements across the internet and on our Site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to the Site and your interaction with
our Service. They may also use information about your visits to the Site and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous
information is collected through the use of pixel tags or cookies, which are industry standard technologies, used by most major websites. No personally
identifiable information is collected or used in this process from our Site. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your
choices about not having this anonymous information used by a third party service provider, please visit these sites:<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and    <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sale of Business or Assets.</strong>
In the event that MamásLatinas, substantially all of its assets, or a line of business is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger,
sale of assets or otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, PII and non-PII of our Members may be one of the assets sold or
merged in connection with that transaction. Information about our Members may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where
MamásLatinas or an affiliate, is seeking financing, investment, support or funding. In such transactions, personal information will be subject to the
promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained.
</p>

<strong>Photos, Videos, and Posts.</strong>
As a MamásLatinas Member you can share personal content. Please be aware that by using any of these features, your personally identifiable information
may be accessible to Members and non-Members, and MamásLatinas has no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Monitoring.</strong>
We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the public and private forums, including in-Site Member
emails and interactive areas on our Site. Please review our <a href="http://www.mamaslatinas.com/about/tos.php">Terms of Service</a> for more information
regarding your appropriate use of these areas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>MamásLatinas Mobile.</strong>
When you provide us with your mobile telephone number to access certain features of MamásLatinas Mobile you agree that this action constitutes a
purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of telemarketing laws. Regardless of the fact that your mobile telephone number may be listed with the
Federal Do-Not-Call Registry, or your local State Do-Not-Call list, you expressly consent to receive future information about MamásLatinas's programs
and services from us, and in that regard, you hereby consent to our contacting you pursuant to the business relationship established using the information
you provided to us. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of
automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable
of receiving.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We'll send you our email and newsletters.</strong>
MamásLatinas may send you service-related announcements and emails from time to time. For instance, if a friend sends you a message, you may receive
an email alerting you to that fact. We may also use your information to send you e-newsletters, updates and communications about MamásLatinas. We may
ask you which newsletters you wish to receive. You may change your newsletter preferences (i) at any time by simply updating your account, which you can do
by clicking on the "Privacy + Settings" button posted throughout the Site, or (ii) by opting-out of receiving future emails as described at the bottom of
each communication from MamásLatinas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sweepstakes and Promotions.</strong>
On occasion, we offer sweepstakes and other promotions in conjunction with a sponsor. By participating in a promotion, you submit to that promotion's terms
and conditions including providing us with permission, if required, to share your personally identifiable information with a particular sponsor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Offers.</strong>
On occasion, we are able to offer you special products or services through a relationship with a third party. In those cases, the offer will be brought to
you by MamásLatinas and fulfilled by the third party. If you accept the offer, you will become a customer of the company that is fulfilling the offer
and we will not have control over their use of the personally identifiable information that you provide to them when you accept the offer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Invite a Friend.</strong>
If you do become a Member, not only can you enjoy all of the benefits of membership, but you can also invite other individuals to join by providing us with
their first names and email addresses. Using the information you give us on these potential Members, we will send them an email invitation to join
MamásLatinas. The only way these individuals can become Members, however, is if they come to our Site and sign up themselves. We do not use this
information for other purposes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Legal Matters; Safety.</strong>
We may, without your consent, access and disclose your information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have
about you or your account as may be permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order or subpoena), or to prevent or investigate
suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may
disclose your information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if
we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>IV. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
MamásLatinas contains links to other sites. It is possible for you to receive information directly from our partners and other companies if you access
them through a link on the Site or if you go directly to their Websites. Once you are on their sites, any data that you supply to these partners, for
example, to obtain information or buy products directly from them, is beyond our reach and will be the responsibility of each of the linked-to entities and
not MamásLatinas. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Websites or any other sites linked to or referenced on our
Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Security.</strong>
We have multiple layers of security on our systems. We have implemented software and hardware security, including firewalls, data encryption, and private
networks intended to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access. We use firewalls and intrusion-detection devices that are
designed to defend against hackers and notify us if any attempts are made to compromise our network. We regularly review additional software upgrades to
enhance our security measures. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your
personally identifiable information, and your use of the Site indicates that you are willing to assume this risk.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong>
Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal
customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That
notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with
their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the address referenced
below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A Note to International Users.</strong>
Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your PII will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy
regulations may be different than other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create an online account to use the Site as a visitor from
outside the United States, you will have agreed to the terms of the Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service and you will have consented to the transfer to
and processing of all such information in the United States, which many not offer an equivalent level of protection of that in the European Union or
certain other countries.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Children's Privacy.</strong>
MamásLatinas does not encourage participation or visitation by children. Visitors who are known to be under the age of 16 are prohibited from becoming
MamásLatinas Members. MamásLatinas does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Updating Your Personal Information.</strong>
If you are a MamásLatinas Member, you can update your personally identifiable information at any time. To do this, just click on the "Privacy +
Settings" link listed throughout the Site. However, we are unable to update or delete any of your personally identifiable information that has been shared
with a third party as permitted in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Waiver.</strong>
MAMÁSLATINAS ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO ANY THEFT, LOSS, ALTERATION OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL OR OTHER INFORMATION LAWFULLY
PROVIDED BY MAMÁSLATINAS TO THIRD PARTIES, OR WITH REGARD TO THE FAILURE OF ANY THIRD PARTY TO ABIDE BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THAT
THIRD PARTY AND MAMÁSLATINAS.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy.</strong>
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Site, with the "Effective
Date" posted at the top of the Policy. We may revise and update this Privacy Policy if our practices change, as technology changes, or as we add new
services or change existing ones. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or how we handle your personal information. If we are going to use
any personal information in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our Privacy Policy at the time we collected such information, we will
give you a reasonable opportunity to consent to the change. If you do not consent, your personal information will be used as agreed to under the terms of
the privacy policy in effect at the time we obtained that information. By using our Site or services after the Effective Date, you are deemed to consent to
our then-current privacy policy. We will use information previously obtained in accordance with the privacy policy in effect when the information was
obtained from you.
</p>
