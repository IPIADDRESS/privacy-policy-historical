<h1>Mamás Latinas Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Effective: November 14, 2011</em></p>
<p>At Mamás Latinas, we are committed to maintaining your privacy and your trust. This Privacy Policy explains
how we collect, protect, use and share information about you when you use the Mamás Latinas website (the "Site").
We hope this information increases your confidence in Mamás Latinas and enhances your experience on our Site.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the <a href="/terms.php">Mamás Latinas Terms of Service</a>.
Each time that you use the Site, you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.
If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Service and terminate your membership.</p>
<h2>I. ABOUT MAMÁS LATINAS </h2>
<p>Mamás Latinas is an online service for moms that allows our mom members to set up unique personal
profiles and, through those profiles, to create an online network of other moms and join in conversation.
Mamás Latinas members ("Members") can view each other’s' profiles, communicate with old friends
and make new friends on the Site, share photos and videos, play games, create and post in groups,
comment on blog posts, and more. To enrich our Members' experience, we request and display some personal
information to other Members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their
network of friends. Mamás Latinas members can change their profile information at any time and can
control how other Members and Mamás Latinas communicates with them.</p>
<h2>II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p><strong>User Provided Information.</strong> Mamás Latinas collects personal information from you when
you register with our Site, update your profile, interact with other Members, and use various features of our Site.
To register with Mamás Latinas, we may ask you to provide your name, birthdate, and email address, and
select a screen name and password. Once you are registered, you will be given the option to add additional
personal information about you and your family to your profile. By using the privacy settings on your profile,
you can control which Members have access to certain of your personal profile data. Keep in mind, however, that
certain basic profile data cannot be hidden and will always be displayed on the Site once they register
(see, "When You Register" below.)</p>
<p>We may also collect information regarding your interaction with other users and your use of the Site.
From time to time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for information and, we collect the
information you provide. We may collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes, games or other
promotions offered on our Site. We may also collect information about you through other methods, including
research surveys or information we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data services,
as well as public sources. We use this information to continually offer you the most value as a Mamás
Latinas Member.</p>
<p>All personally identifiable information that we collect may become part of your Mamás Latinas Member
file and may be used by Mamás Latinas as provided in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed at the time you
provide the information or as otherwise agreed by you.</p>
<p><strong>Web Logs.</strong> Like most standard Website servers, we collect information from all visitors to the
Site. This information may include the browser you are using, the internet address from which you linked to our
Site, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Site,
and usage and browsing habits. We use this information to help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions,
to analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also
use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Site uses
data "cookies." We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie
expires when you close your browser. We use persistent cookies to differentiate users of the Site from
subscribers, to customize the content of certain sections of the Site and to enable us to track and cater to the
interests of users, in order to enhance their experience on the Site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard
drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your
Internet browser's "help" file. Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need
improvement. We will not use cookies or other data capture mechanisms to collect any personally identifiable
information about you. You may configure your browser to prevent cookies from being set on your computer. If you
reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site may be limited, and
you may not be able to use certain features of the Site, including playing games or entering sweepstakes or
contests. Other technologies might be used by us or our advertising partners, such as Flash cookies, which are
a form of persistent cookies technically called "Local Shared Objects" (LSOs), or HTML5 "Media Stamp" technology.
Flash cookies are set through a mechanism in Adobe Flash Player. With Flash cookies your data is stored in
multiple places and it may be restored once you delete it. To prevent new Flash cookies from being placed, you
can adjust your preferences on a per site basis in the Adobe Website Privacy Settings Panel. Using this tool,
Flash cookies can be completely disabled or allowed on a per-domain basis. To get to the settings panel, right
click on any Flash movie, click settings and then advanced. Adobe has published a guide to help users disable
Flash cookies found at <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/546/4c68e546.html" target="_blank">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/546/4c68e546.html</a>.
Flash cookies are stored in a special directory depending on the operating system on your computer. They are
arranged in directories according to the site that placed them on the computer (look for a file with a .SOL).
HTML5 or Media Stamp technology has a local storage feature that, when used, allows for quicker access to a
website upon a return visit. HTML5 is currently supported by some mobile devices and desktop browsers. Like
Flash cookies, HTML5 Media Stamp data is not stored in a browser's "cookies" file.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Our Web pages and our e-mail newsletters contain "web beacons." Web beacons
allow us to count users that have visited a web page or opened an email that contains a web beacon and collect
other types of aggregate information. Using this information, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our
advertising and how visitors use our Site. This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors,
which parts of our Site are the most interesting and what kind of offers our Members like to see. Some of the
web beacons that are in place on our Site are used only by Mamás Latinas, and other web beacons are from
our vendors and advertisers who use this data to assist us in analyzing how our Members use the Site. In
addition, we have agreements with various affiliate networks that promote Mamás Latinas on their affiliate
websites. These affiliate advertisers may use web beacons in their advertisements to track users who click through
from the affiliate website to the Site.</p>
<h2>III. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p><strong>When you Register.</strong> When you register with Mamás Latinas, you create your own profile
and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your screen name and photo, are displayed to people
in the networks specified in your privacy settings to allow you to connect with other Mamás Latinas Members.
Your real name is never displayed on the Site (unless you use it as your screen name), but your real name will
be included in emails that you "send to a friend." You can choose to allow Members to search for you by using
your real name or most other information you have entered in your profile.</p>
<p>Please be aware that certain personal profile information is displayed for all Members and cannot be hidden.
Specifically, your screen name andphoto are always displayed on the Site and therefore, are viewable by all users.
In addition, because this information is publicly displayed on the Site, it may appear in the results of searches
conducted on Internet search engines while you are a Member of the Site and potentially for some time period after
your membership is terminated, depending upon the search engine's indexing practices.</p>
<p>By using the search functionality on the Site, Mamás Latinas Members can find other moms with similar
interests and challenges. When you find other Members, you can view their personal profiles to find out more
about them based on the information they have decided to share on the Site.</p>
<p><strong>Photos, Videos, and Posts.</strong> As a Mamás Latinas Member, you can share personal content.
Please be aware that by using any of these features, your personally identifiable information may be accessible
to Members and non-Members, and Mamás Latinas has no control over how those users may use your personally
identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring.</strong> We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content
associated with the public and private forums and interactive areas on our Site. Please review our
<a href="terms.php">Terms of Service</a> for more information regarding your appropriate use of these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Mamás Latinas Mobile.</strong> When you provide us with your mobile telephone number to access
certain features of Mamás Latinas Mobile you agree that this action constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or
application for purposes of telemarketing laws. Regardless of the fact that your mobile telephone number may be
listed with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry, or your local State Do-Not-Call list, you expressly consent to
receive future information about Mamás Latinas's programs and services from us, and in that regard, you
hereby consent to our contacting you pursuant to the business relationship established using the information you
provided to us. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile
telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of
communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>
<p><strong>We'll send you our email and newsletters.</strong> Mamás Latinas may send you service-related
announcements and emails from time to time. For instance, if a friend sends you a message, you may receive an
email alerting you to that fact. We may also use your information to send you e-newsletters, updates and
communications about Mamás Latinas. We may ask you which newsletters you wish to receive. You may change
your newsletter preferences (i) at any time by simply updating your account, which you can do by clicking on the
"Privacy + Settings" button posted throughout the Site, or (ii) by opting-out of receiving future emails as
described at the bottom of each communication from Mamás Latinas.</p>
<p><strong>Sweepstakes and Promotions.</strong> On occasion, we offer sweepstakes and other promotions in
conjunction with a sponsor. By participating in a promotion, you submit to that promotion's terms and conditions
including providing us with permission, if required, to share your personally identifiable information with a
particular sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Offers.</strong> On occasion, we are able to offer you special products or services through
a relationship with a third party. In those cases, the offer will be brought to you by Mamás Latinas and
fulfilled by the third party. If you accept the offer, you will become a customer of the company that is fulfilling
the offer and we will not have control over their use of the personally identifiable information that you provide
to them when you accept the offer.</p>
<p><strong>Invite a Friend.</strong> If you do become a Member, not only can you enjoy all of the benefits of
membership, but you can also invite other individuals to join by providing us with their first names and email
addresses. Using the information you give us on these potential Members, we will send them an email invitation
to join Mamás Latinas. The only way these individuals can become Members, however, is if they come to our
Site and sign up themselves. We do not use this information for other purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Matters; Safety.</strong> We may, without your consent, access and disclose your information,
any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you or your account
as may be permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order or subpoena), or to prevent
or investigate suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal
or may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose your information in situations that we believe
to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that
your information in any way relates to that threat.</p>
<p><strong>Sale of Business or Assets.</strong> In the event that Mamás Latinas, substantially all of its
assets, or a line of business is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or
otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personally identifiable information of
our Members may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction. Information about our
Members may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where Mamás Latinas or
an affiliate, is seeking financing, investment, support or funding. In such transactions, personal information
will be subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Ad Servers.</strong> We may use third party advertising technology to serve ads when you
visit our Site. We may from time to time use various outside ad-serving companies to serve advertisements across
the internet and on our Site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to the Site and your
interaction with our Service. They may also use information about your visits to the Site and other websites to
target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of pixel
tags or cookies, which are industry standard technologies, used by most major websites. No personally identifiable
information is collected or used in this process from our Site. If you would like more information about this
practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by a third party service
provider, please visit these sites:

compromise our network. We regularly review additional software upgrades to enhance our security measures.
However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to
your personally identifiable information, and your use of the Site indicates that you are willing to assume this risk.</p>
