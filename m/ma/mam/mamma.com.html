      <p>Mamma.com respects your right to privacy. We understand the sensitive
        nature of privacy issues and the company takes measures to ensure that
        your confidentiality is protected.</p>
      <p>By using Mamma.com, you consent to the following privacy policy. This
        policy is subject to change and updates will be posted on this page.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><span class="subsectionpara">Coverage</span><br>
        This policy applies to our URLs www.mamma.com and www.mama.com. More specifically,
        any URL ending with mamma.com, and that includes a link to this policy
        at the bottom of the page are covered by this privacy policy. The presence
        of the Mamma.com logo alone does not guarantee the applicability of this
        policy. </p>
      <p>This policy does not apply to our partners, advertisers or any other
        web site that may be connected, in any way, with Mamma.com.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><span class="subsectionpara">Third-Party Links</span><br>
        As a search engine, and as an advertising publisher, you will find various
        kinds of links on our site, including but not limited to: metasearch results,
        Mamma Favorites, banners, Mamma Classifieds, and Mamma's Partners. These
        sites are owned and maintained by outside companies, over which Mamma.com
        has no control, and who are not covered by this privacy policy. Mamma.com
        is not responsible for the content of these sites, or their collection
        of information and its use. If you have any concerns about your privacy
        at one of these sites, please review their sites' policies or contact
        them directly.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><span class="subsectionpara">Banner Advertisements</span><br>
        Third-party servers supply some of the banner advertisements that appear
        on Mamma.com. Some of these advertisers have the ability to deposit cookies
        on your computer in order to track performance and to limit the number
        of times a particular banner is shown to you. These cookies are separate
        from our own (see below) and the information collected from them is not
        shared with Mamma.com.</p>
      <p>Like the links we provide to other web sites, these third-party servers
        are not covered by Mamma.com's privacy policy.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><span class="subsectionpara">Cookies</span><br>
        A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your computers' hard
        drive when visiting our site, and may also be transmitted when customizing
        your search preferences in our Power Search, or when registering for one
        of our services. No personal information is stored within the cookie.
        It is an anonymous piece of data that simply identifies your computer
        IP address, but not you.</p>
      <p>Cookies are used to identify you as a unique user, and to let us know
        when you return to our site. They are used to provide customizable services,
        serve relevant advertising, and to monitor our traffic.</p>
      <p>You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings of
        your browser. Or, you can opt to be warned before a cookie is deposited
        on your computer.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><span class="subsectionpara">Contact Information</span><br>
        Mamma.com only has access to your personal (identifiable) contact information
        in the following circumstances:</p>
      <p>1. When you send comments, questions, suggestions, or feedback to Mamma.com
        via email, and include an email address and/or contact information. In
        these cases, Mamma.com only uses this information to respond to you.</p>
      <p>2. When you participate in special offers, contests, or surveys, the
        collection of contact information is often required for registration,
        and for winner notification. In some instances, these are co-sponsored
        and so your information will be shared with that particular partner.</p>
      <p>3. Signing up for Mamma services, including but not limited to the affiliates
        program, premium placement advertising, and partnership programs require
        registration, and the submission of certain information, which often includes
        contact information. Some of these products also require payment information
        in addition to contact details. To ensure your security in these circumstances
        Mamma.com uses a third-party credit card processing site for the entrance
        and (possible) storage of your credit card information. If you are not
        willing to provide this information to Mamma.com you may choose not to
        participate in these programs.</p>
      <p>Please note, that some contests or services advertised on or through
        Mamma.com may require personal contact information in order to enter or
        register. This information is not shared with Mamma.com, and these advertisers
        are not covered by this privacy policy (please see Third-Party Links,
        above).</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><span class="subsectionpara">Unsolicited Contact</span><br>
        Mamma.com will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third-parties,
        unless otherwise stated (please see 2, under Contact Information). We
        may, however, occasionally send emails to subscribers of our services,
        or survey respondents regarding new services or offers from Mamma.com
        or selected partners that may be of interest.</p>
      <p>Mamma.com respects your right to unsubscribe from company mailings at
        any time. To do so, please contact our <a href="help/contact.html?department=3">Customer Service department</a>.</p>

        respondents, etc., with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and
