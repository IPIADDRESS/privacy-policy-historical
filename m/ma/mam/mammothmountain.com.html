<h2><a name="Security">Security</a></h2>

<p>"Clearance" and a "need to know" form the basis for our security 
 policy. "Clearance" is not enough to view secure information; an 
 employee must also have the "need" to see that information. Clearance 
 means that an employee has gained the trust of our organization 
 through dedicated service. By enforcing both "clearance" and a "need 
 to know" we limit those who have access to your personal information 
 and we can easily enforce accountability.</p>

<p>Mammoth Mountain has gone to great lengths to ensure the security of your financial information such as credit card and other booking information. All credit card transactions are handled on separate secure servers. Only authorized employees have access to these servers and your personal information that resides on those servers.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a name="InformationCollection">Personal Information Collection and Use</a></h2>

<p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with outside organizations. Mammoth asks you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your site visit, process your order correctly, and if necessary, follow up with you before or after your visit.</p>


<p>We will request information from you when you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Register on MammothMountain.com</li>
        <li>Plan a trip to Mammoth Mountain</li>
        <li>Place an order with Mammoth Mountain</li>
        <li>Provide feedback in an online survey</li>
        <li>Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer</li>
        <li>Subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list</li>
        <li>Create your online guest profile</li>
        <li>Participate in loyalty or club card programs</li>
        <li>Purchase specific services such as rentals, lessons, and lodging</li>
      </ul>



<p>In each of these instances, we may ask for any of the following types of information: name, e-mail address, phone number, address, birthdate, customer and trip preference information, customer ID and password, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers.</p>

<p>Additionally, we may collect data to better understand your preferences. This information allows us to improve our products and services, and to offer you specially tailored deals when appropriate.</p>

      <p> We may ask for an age or birth date when applicable for guest identification 
        and pricing purposes (for instance, children and seniors qualify for discounts 
        on lift tickets) and when creating your online guest profile. Federal 
        law prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on age, so 
        when we send out information on lodging bookings we are required to treat 
        all site members equally, regardless of age.</p>
      <hr>

<h2><a name="Profile">Changing Profile and Opting Out</a></h2>

      <p>If you chose to not receive promotional material or special offers from 
        us including but not limited to e-mail, direct mail or telephone, we ask 
        that you tell us by opting out if given the choice or by calling us at 
        760-934-0745. You have the ability to create a guest profile by <a href="login/signmeup.cfm">clicking 
        here</a> and creating a personal preferences profile. Creating a guest 
        profile enables you to customize your interaction with Mammoth by choosing 
        or changing your preferences, updating your information, opting in or 
        out of direct mail and e-mail communication at any time.</p> 

      <p>Please note that in the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will 
        be able to unsubscribe from these mailings at any time by updating your 
        preferences in your guest profile.</p>

<p>When you register and create your account using the internet, we will confirm your registration by
 sending an email to the address that you supplied to us. All future emails to your account will contain
 information on how to remove you from our distribution lists.</p> 

<p>We may also use personal account information to generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal
 use and for sharing with affiliates. These statistics and aggregate reports will not contain any personally 
 identifiable information. Your identity is kept anonymous.</p>

<p>Aggregate information may be used to design programs and promotions that we think would be of
 interest to an identified group of customers. For example, if an analysis of purchase data shows that
 30% of our guests are intermediate skiers who rent equipment, we may want to develop a special 
 rental/lesson program for them to test new gear.</p>

<h2><a name="Cookies">Internet Tracking using Cookies</a></h2>

      <p>Depending on how you configure your browser, when you visit MammothMountain.com 
        a small file (a "cookie") is stored on your hard drive. Whenever you log 
        onto MammothMountain.com our server looks for your cookie and may make 
        adjustments in order to customize what appears as you browse our site. 
        If your browser is set to reject cookies, none of this customization is 
        possible. </p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Disclosure">Non-Use and Disclosure</a></h2>

<p>We do not and will not sell, rent, or share your information to any outside entity. Please remember that anything posted on our forums becomes public information and you should exercise caution about disclosing personal information on those pages.</p>


<p>Mammoth Mountain reserves the right to cooperate with local, provincial, federal, and international officials in any investigation requiring either personal information (including any information provided on-line through MammothMountain.com) or reports about lawful of unlawful user activity on this site.</p>


<p>Mammoth Mountain also reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.</p>





<hr>


<h2><a name="Children">Children's Privacy</a></h2>

      <p>Mammoth Mountain does not knowingly solicit data from, or about, people 
        under the age of 16 years for the purposes of selling directly to these 
        individuals. Mammoth Mountain assumes that visitors to our site are adults.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Liability">Legal Liability</a></h2>

<p>Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall Mammoth Mountain be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, loss of data or profit, arising out of the use, or the inability to use, the materials on this site, even if Mammoth Mountain or a Mammoth Mountain authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
