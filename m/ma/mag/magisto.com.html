<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<br>

Last Updated March 2011

<p style="text-indent:0in"><span style="">This privacy statement explains the privacy
practices of SightEra for users of the Site.<b> </b>If not specifically defined
herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the SightEra Terms
of Service, which are available at <a href="/tos">http://www.magisto.com/tos</a></span></p>

<p></p><h2>SightEra's Commitment to Privacy</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="">SightEra respects your right to privacy.
Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is
important to us. This privacy statement explains SightEra's policy regarding
the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Personal Information. The
terms of this privacy policy apply to information collected from you unless
different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or
contract we provide you.</span></p>

<p></p><h2>What
is Personal Information?</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="">"Personal Information" is information that
can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a
customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number,
or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or
her purchases. Personal Information also includes information that you may choose
to provide to us, such as your educational, medical and employment history
profile. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="">Personal information does not include
"aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group
or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer
identities have been <span>removed</span>.<span>  </span>In other words, information about how you use
a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use
the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting
data. Likewise, information about the products or services you use or purchase
may be collected and combined with information about the products and services used
or purchased by others, but no Personal Information will be included in the
resulting data. Aggregate data helps understand trends and customer needs so
that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and
services can be tailored to customer desires.</span></p>

<p></p><h2>Collection
of Personal Information</h2>

<p><span style="">We
collect Personal Information that you provide us, such as when you:</span></p>

<p><span style=""><span><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">                     
</span></span></span><span dir="LTR"></span><span style="">register to use the Site or Services;</span></p>

<p><span style=""><span><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">                     
</span></span></span><span dir="LTR"></span><span style="">post or submit any content on the Site
or Services, including any video or audio content; or</span></p>

<p><span style=""><span><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">                     
</span></span></span><span dir="LTR"></span><span><span style="">contact</span></span><span style=""> us for any reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="">We
may automatically collect some information when you use the Site or Services,
such as your computer's IP address, operating system, the site from which you
linked to us, and the time and date of your visit, and activities.<b> </b>We
also collect information received from third parties to the extent that they have
entered into an agreement with you as a result of your relationship with SightEra.
</span></p>

<p></p><h2>Use
of Personal Information</h2>

<p><span style="">The
Personal Information we collect is used to process your requests or
transactions, to provide you high quality service, to customize your use of the
Site or Services according to your preferences, and to tell you about specific
goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. <span> </span>If you prefer not to receive promotional
information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us
at any time to decline promotional information (see under the heading "Choice"
below).<b><i></i></b></span></p>

<p></p><h2>Sharing
of Personal Information</h2>

<p><span style="">SightEra
does not sell, rent, share, or disclose Personal Information to third parties
without your prior consent, except in the limited circumstances described in
this statement. </span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in"><span style="">Videos</span></p>

<p><span style=";font-weight:normal">Summaries
and edits of video produced by the Site and the Services will be made available
to you via an internet link made available to you, including without limitation
by email. You should not reveal this link or send this email to third parties.
If you reveal this link or send this email to third parties, such third parties
will have full access to such summarized and edited videos as well as any
confidential or personal information on such video.<span>  </span>As such, you should have no expectation of
confidentiality in videos or other material if you have revealed the applicable
link to third parties. </span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in"><span style="">Communities<i></i></span></p>

<p><span style=";font-weight:normal">If you use any of the features of the Site or Services,
please remember that any information disclosed in these venues may be
automatically made public, even without your knowledge or authorization. You
should exercise caution when disclosing any information, including Personal
Information, in such venues, as you do not know who will access or use such
information and for what purposes. SightEra is in no way responsible for the
accuracy, use or misuse of any information, including Personal Information, which
you disclose in such venues.</span></p>

<h2>Other Disclosures</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="">In addition, we may disclose Personal Information
in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so
is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to any claims, or
to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SightEra, our customers,
or the public. <span> </span>Information about our
customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of, or
during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition.</span></p>

of Personal Information</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="">SightEra has put into place security
measures in an effort to protect personal information from loss, misuse or
alteration while it is under our control. Personal information we collect is
stored electronically and may be combined with other membership information. We
use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort
to protect against unauthorized access.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="">Account information is accessible online
only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal
information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to
any other person.<span>  </span>If other people have
access to your email, they may be able to obtain access to your password and
obtain personal information about you (such as your credit card information),
or change information about your user profile. You may not want to use an email
account operated by an employer because many employers have the legal right to
access such email accounts.</span></p>
