This statement of privacy covers how magTXT treats personal information collected and received, including information relating to the past use of our services. &quot;Personal Information&quot; refers to information that personally identifies you by your name, email address or phone number and other information that is not otherwise available publicly. This statement of privacy applies only to the practices of magTXT and the people we employ or manage. Other websites or services linked to/from this website will have their own statements of privacy which can be viewed on their respective privacy links.&nbsp;


Privacy Policy&nbsp;
We at magTXT, have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your personal information and informing you about how we handle it. This privacy policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on the magTXT Website. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. This privacy policy was last revised on 5th of August 2012. Each time you visit the site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.&nbsp;


Your IP Address&nbsp;
Each time you visit the site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the site for you and to diagnose problems with our site, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you.&nbsp;


Cookies&nbsp;
magTXT may use cookies (a small file placed on your computer’s hard drive) that enables us to collect information which pages you find useful and which you do not.&nbsp;
Cookies are also needed for login and registration. magTXT and other third parties such as our advertisers may also use cookies to serve ads to you based on your visit to our website.&nbsp;
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. To opt out of Google’s use of cookies, please visit Google ad and content network privacy policy.&nbsp;
Third party advertisers on the site may also place or read cookies on your browser. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas on the site.&nbsp;
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our website as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.&nbsp;
Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.&nbsp;


DoubleClick DART Cookies&nbsp;
magTXT also use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer’s hard drive when you are browsing this website using DoubleClick advertising such as Google Adsense advertisements.&nbsp;
This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (“interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history. DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your bank account numbers or credit card numbers and etc. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all websites using this advertising by visiting http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/.&nbsp;


Information We Collect From You&nbsp;
In order to operate the site and to provide you with information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we may collect &quot;personal information&quot;, &quot;financial information&quot; or &quot;demographic information&quot;, subject to the rest of this paragraph. We ask that you do not enter personal information or financial information into your profile, because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the site, and the information will then be treated as &quot;demographic information&quot; that is &quot;public information.&quot; Please note that nowhere on the site do we knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18, as we require that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years old.&nbsp;


Information Other websites Collect From You&nbsp;
On the site, we place links to other websites operated by other parties. Some of these other websites contain our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit these other websites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that we do not control these other websites or these other websites' business practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other websites. Consequently, the operators of these other websites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were collected on the site. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.&nbsp;


How We Use Personal Information&nbsp;
We use your personal information to help us efficiently operate the site, to contact you in connection with your transactions and other activities on the site including, but not limited to, confirmation emails or important news that could affect your relationship with magTXT, and to forward messages to you from other magTXT users. These types of communications, are known as &quot;Operational Communications.&quot; In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner advertisements and special offers.&nbsp;

By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by third parties on the site, or electing to receive communications or electing to participate in contests, or other reward programs, offered or sponsored by third parties on the site, you consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties. Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us.&nbsp;

In some cases, we may enter into a promotional relationship with another company in which we prominently display their brand name or trademarks on pages of the site. These pages are known as &quot;Co-Branded Pages&quot; and these companies are known as Co-Branded Companies. If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share your personal information with the associated Co-Branded Company. Co-Branded Companies may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact Co-Branded Companies to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such Co-Branded Companies in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us. Some Co-Branded Pages may contain an action tag (also known as a Web Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file) that a third party, such as the advertising company Avenue A, may use to read cookies that it, or its clients, may have placed on your browser at other (non-magTXT) web sites before your visit to magTXT. This technology is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements on such other websites that promote Co-Branded Pages.&nbsp;

Any third party with whom we are allowed to share your personal information is authorized to use your personal information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.&nbsp;


How do We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information&nbsp;
We may review all demographic information. We may use public information to enable other users to find your profile, to determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We may use demographic information to tailor the site and communications to your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis. One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to magTXT users, so that we may target specific advertisements at specific demographic groups. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous, subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic group. Please also be aware that when we disclose your financial information or personal information to a Co-Branded Company, as described above, we may also disclose to that Co-Branded Company your demographic information, other than the content of one-on-one communications between you and other members. Please also be aware that we may disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis.&nbsp;


Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information&nbsp;
If at any point we decide to use particular personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email or by providing 30 days notice on the site. Please note that we will continue to have the right to change our privacy policy and practices, and how we use your personally identifiable information, without notice, as described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, provided that such changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the change.&nbsp;


For any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, the practices of the site, or your dealings with the site, you can contact us at magTXT@gmail.com.

It is located in the Sulu Sea between the island of Agutaya and Cuyo. The Pamalican Island is found north of Palawan. It is part of a numerous groups of island which makes up the Cuyo Archipelago. Though it is a small island with an estimate of 500 meters width, it is considered as one of Philippines’ best island private resorts. Originally the island was a plantation until it was bought by a businessman named Andres Soriano Jr. It was then his children who made a decision to transform it into a private resort. At present, its totality now belongs to the resort which is owned by Sorianos called the Seven Seas Resort. It is also a branch of the Aman Resorts resort group nemd the Amanpulo.

</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-title"><span class="field-content"><a href="/article/57/why-chocolate-bad-your-dogs" hreflang="en">Why Chocolate is Bad for Your Dogs?</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Indeed dogs can be your 24/7 companion. They are always available for you and just for you only. There are three things that dogs love. First of course you as its human best friend, be happy because you are on the top of the list. Second, dogs love to play. It is up to you to define how our dogs play, some would enjoy and settle for short walks in the streets or somewhere where he can enjoy his eyes of things he find interesting. Lastly, dogs love to eat!&nbsp; However although you wanted to share everything to your lovely pet, there are some restrictions that you need to follow in giving your dog some treats.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are only few people who are not fond of chocolates. In fact almost all would get excited about it. Chocolates come in cakes, drinks, ice-creams and many more. But do you know that your most favorite flavor is actually bad for your dog? You could be torn on which is which, but as long as you will not share your chocolate with your dog, everything will be fine.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So what’s inside this chocolate that it can be bad for dogs yet humans love it so much? Chocolate is extracted from the cocoa fruit. Chocolates contain a certain compound called “Theobromine” which is actually a type of alkaloid. It is somewhat the same with caffeine, both are classified as stimulants. The problem occurs due to the inability of dogs to break this compound. Dogs don’t have the enzyme to metabolize Theobromine thus it stays within the dogs system and becomes toxic. Since it is considered as a stimulant, it affects the central nervous system (CNS) of your dog, causing increase in the level of blood pressure. This will then result to rapid heart rate, seizure, and vomiting, frequent urination, muscle twitching, hyperactive behavior, dehydration and many more. With all of these complications it can certainly put the dog into a fatal condition. In more of common terms, people would say that dogs are allergic to chocolates, dogs are not allergic to chocolates but chocolates are bad for them because there is no way for them to metabolize it.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover the amount of chocolates that can cause those complications mentioned above will actually depend on the size of your dog. Larger dogs may have a much higher tolerance with the toxicity of the compound. Meanwhile the small ones may are more likely to react even in small amount of chocolates. Before thinking of giving your dog some of your favorite sweets, think a thousand times before doing so. You are risking your dog’s life because of your inappropriate thoughts.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

And on December of the same year he retired from military service but went on to live in Manila. But Roosevelt regionalized the Philippine Army on July 26, 1941. He then reassigned MacArthur to stand as major general of the American Army naming Douglas as commander of the USAFFE. Within a day, Macarthur’s promotion to lieutenant was proclaimed. Afterwards he was promoted on December 20, 1941 as a general. Other known officers were also promoted during that time. Sutherland became major general and Hugh Casey became brigadier general. By July 31, 1941 over twenty two thousand troops had been assigned by the Philippine Department.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;General Douglas MacArthur’s famous ‘’I shall return’’ speech were a result of his escape from one of the most famous battles in the history of the Philippines known as the Fall of Bataan. In December 8, 1941 MacArthur was informed by Sutherland of the ambush on Pearl Harbor. Gen. George Marshall gave MacArthur orders to continue the original Rainbow Five war plan. But Douglas refused to follow the order. There were also requests of permission to hit bases owned by the Japanese from an Air Force commander but all were denied. They were confused on what to do next because of the attack that happened on Pearl Harbor. At noontime, Japanese Air crafts surprised and bombarded Clark Field and bases at the Iba Field and in a few days the US Air Force were all destroyed.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When the defense plans failed to stop the Japanese from taking Manila, the Filipino and U.S. Forces were called to retreat and bring all the war supplies to Bataan. MacArthur tried to lessen the Japanese speed in advancing but changed his mind when he saw the quick advancement of the Japanese and their superiority in battle against the Filipino troops. He called everyone to retreat to the Bataan peninsula to wait for reinforcements there. On December 24, 1941 the declaration of Manila as an open city was announced.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the next day, MacArthur had to transfer his headquarters to the fortresses of Corregidor due to the destruction of nearly all of the USAFFE bases. Many of the headquarters started to go for Bataan to leave MacArthur. Although the Filipino and Americans knew they were hopeless they still fought the Japanese. Some of them blamed MacArthur because of the failure but others believed he would find a way to get them out of the mess.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Japanese Army gradually neutralized most of the defenders of the Philippines on February in 1942. On the same year President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to move to Australia. He left with his family and major general Sutherland in PT boats away from Corregidor on March 12, 1942. They were received by B-17s and flew off to Australia. On March 20, 1942 he made his famous speech to return to the Philippine Islands. He was told by Washington to change the “I” on his statement to “we” but MacArthur refused it. In his speech he said, “ I came through and I shall return” stressing his resolve to redeem the Philippines from its enemies. &nbsp;Meanwhile, after a series of battles, Bataan fell to the hands of the Japanese Army.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;October 1944 gave MacArthur the chance he’d been waiting for. On the 20th of that month, and after efforts to be summoned by Roosevelt to Philippines, General Douglas was finally back in the Philippines. He landed on Leyte with the Sixth Army of Krueger’s troops where they waded on foot in the waters of the Leyte beach. He also made another famous speech where he reassured the Filipinos of his promise to eradicate their enemies once and for all. And after two months, the Japanese Army lost Leyte to the US Army.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

Its scientific name is the Pterocarpus. It is also known in other countries as the New Guinea Rosewood or Malay Paduak. Others call it Pashu Padauk. Among other countries aside from Philippines, the Narra is also found in Indonesia, China, Papua New Guinea and Malaysia.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The tree grows up from thirty up to forty meters high. It has a trunk with an average of two meters in diameter. It is a deciduous tree that is very large in structure. Its leaves are usually 12-22 centimeters long. The pinnate has 5 up to 11 leaflets with a girth that is 12 to 34 meters wide. The flowers of the narra grows in panicles which is 6 to 13 centimeters long. This panicle contains fe to some flowers. The months of the flowering of the Narra depends on the country where it grows. In Philippines the flowering takes place starting from February to May. The flowers are fragrant but only slightly. The normal color is yellow or sometimes orange-yellow. The flowers of Narra also grows fruits that are semiorbicular pods of 2 to 3 cm in diameter. They are surrounded by flat wings which are 4-6 cm in diameter. These wing-like figures helps in the dispersals of the wind.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Narra is considered as one of the national symbols of the Philippines. This is due to its variety in terms of uses and aids in the daily lives of the people. The constituents of the tree is known to yield “kino” which contains kinotannic acid. The woods are also known to yield othe constituents such as narrin, santalin and angolensin. The Narra is notable for its swiftness in growth and its strength in terms of hardness. It is the top hardest tree in the Philippines. Aside from that, it can grow well regardless if its planted on bottom lands. It is also remarkable for being less vulnerable to pests and diseases compared to other trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are some parts of Narra that are edible too. Its leaves and flowers are one of the examples. Also, the flowers have been reported as being a good source for honey. Aside from being edible, the narra tree offers medicinal aid to help heal diseases and other daily needs. For example, the infusion of its leaf can be used for making shampoo. It can also be used for treating diarrhea, stones, dropsy, sores and ailments in the bladder.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In other cases, the leaves of the Narra tree when they are still young can be boiled and used on boils, ulcers and prickly heat. The decoction of it can be used as aid for sore throats, as astringents or as mouthwash to treat toothaches. Bladder stones and dropsy can be dissolved too by the decoction of its leaves. Other benefits of the Narra can be taken from its resin which is a “kino” which can be used for the treatment of chronic diarrhea and hemorrhages.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The strength of the Narra tree is not only found in the physical structure of its body but also in the gentler parts which consists of the flowers and its leaves and fruits.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-title"><span class="field-content"><a href="/article/56/what-happened-iphone7s-headphone-jack" hreflang="en">What Happened to Iphone7's Headphone Jack?</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is again September and all eyes and ears are waiting for the release of Iphone’s latest member, the Iphone 7. So what are the new things that buyers should anticipate or expect for this device? Is it just similar to its predecessors or it has something very unique to offer? Much of these hunches, it seems like there are things that will totally surprise the people. The questions of will people be glad or mad about it, is surely something any interested buyer should take note.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One thing that is remarkably new about this device is the loss or absence of the headphone jack. Iphone7 did drop off the historic headphone jack in exchange of the iphone earpods. Users should expect for a wireless lightning earpods that works through bluetooth connection. Choosing to go wireless has drawn so much controversy to the Apple Company, yet their Marketing Chief Phil Schiller, stood firm and proud of the dynamic change of the Iphone7. According to Schiller, they decided to get rid of the traditional analog type of headphones not due to superficial reasons or perhaps to elicit an elegant style, but because the traditional design is consuming too much space for the device’s new processor. They have to let go of it and had the courage to go wireless.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, although it’s for the device’s own good in order to optimize its capacity, these lightning earpods are actually sold separately. Yes, you heard it right. Unlike the usual package when you buy a new device, Iphone7’s lightning earpods are not for free. So what’s the deal if you opt only for the device and you find it too costly to go for the lightning earpods? Well, you can still use your old headphones but it will take a quite turn before you can use it. You need to use an adapter that you have to connect through the charging port and connect your headphones on that adapter.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which would look like this:



&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s indeed quite a job and a bit hassle, especially when you choose to walk around with your headphones on. With this, one will surely decide to go for the lightning earpods, if and only if you have the budget for it.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-title"><span class="field-content"><a href="/article/66/make-can-make-your-skin-healthy" hreflang="en">Make-up that Can Make Your Skin Healthy</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">Make-ups and other forms of cosmetics were made to enhance a person’s good assets and hide or conceal imperfections. It has been part of the daily lives of the people, mostly by women. To look beautiful and presentable has always been part of any woman’s goals of the day. It is an unspoken rule that if you can’t be beautiful then be at least presentable. Whether you like it or not, first impression doesn’t only last, it really matters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is a sad reality that although these make-ups and cosmetics can make a person look more beautiful it contains chemicals that can actually take away your natural glow or natural beauty. Lipsticks contain certain compounds that can actually darken your lips and change its natural color. Other make-ups can also cause skin allergies or irritation and even cause skin impurities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good thing, organic make ups are now available in the market. You can now enjoy using these kinds of cosmetics without worrying of any side effects. Organic make-ups are proven to be safe and free from harmful chemicals. If you are thinking of shifting to organic make-ups there are things that you need to know so that you will not be left dissatisfied with your decision.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since organic makeups uses pure and organic materials, it is way more expensive compared to the ordinary make up products. But if this ensures the health of your skin, it is still a very good investment despite of its price. Also, there are only few choices for organic make-ups, such as lipstick shades. It is because unlike the ordinary type of cosmetics, organic make ups depend only on natural occurring colors which can be extracted from organic compounds. Commercial or ordinary cosmetics use artificial colors in order to achieve almost every shade that they want to produce. Also, organic make ups have shorter expiration periods. Again, because of being organic and free from chemicals, its shelf life is also affected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patronizing organic make up can actually be part of a healthy living lifestyle. The more you eliminate artificial chemicals within your daily routine the healthier you are. Organic products can never be beaten even by the most popular brand of make-up. Sometimes you don’t actually need to have full coverage of make-up foundation; sometimes you just have to make ways to make your skin healthier. Once you nourish it properly, you will no longer worry about acne breakouts, and other skin blemishes. Practice proper hygiene and start using products that are actually doing great for your skin inside and out.

Samsung on October 12, finally issued statement declaring the death of galaxy note 7.

The galaxy note 7 faced tons of complaints all over the world because of its tendency to explode. It has caused major threat to the safety of the people. As a result, a remarkable drop in sales has been noted for this device. In the interest of Samsung to preserve its customers, they tried to recall all galaxy note 7 that were sold to the public. Some of the remedy that they offered was to issue refund particularly for those customers who already lost interest in waiting for the galaxy note 7 to be back.
However, just a few days after the first few recalls were issued, another incident involving the device took place. A man using his galaxy note 7 begun to notice that his device was slowly emitting a smoke and it started to overheat. In happened inside a Southwest Aircraft, thus the airline company was forced to return to the airport because of the incident.
In previous statements, galaxy note 7 tend to overheat and explode upon charging, that it why all airline companies prohibit their passengers to charge their devices inside the aircraft using power banks and the likes. However with the latest case, the man wasn’t actually charging his device. He was just using it like the usual, yet it started to produce smoke inside the aircraft. Although, Samsung did not issued formal statement regarding the matter, they have promised to check on it and do the best that they can in solving such disastrous happenings.

Barely three days after the aircraft incident, Samsung has finally broke its silence by issuing a statement declaring the death of Samsung galaxy note 7. It is indeed a major disaster for the company to declare such thing however according to them it was the best thing that they can do to ensure the safety of the people. It is absolutely a major loss for them but they would like to assure the public that the safety of their consumers is much more important than their sales. They on the other hand, assured the public that the note series will still continue and that it is going to be better than ever, but as of now the galaxy note 7 is signing off.

One of the most talked about remarks was made by an actress, Ms. Agot Isidro. Ms. Isidro, in her Facebook status update, slammed the President for the statements he gave during one of his speeches. Aside from criticizing Duterte with his way of governance and his behavior to other foreign personalities, she ended her post by calling Duterte not a Bipolar but a Psychopath.

Ms. Isidro’s statement steamed over the social media. Several people expressed disagreement with her post not because of her remarks toward the President, but when she used the term Bipolar and Psychopath. The comments in general condemned Ms. Agot’s use of these terms without being aware of the weight of her statements. She is not an expert on such field yet she vocally used it as if it is just a common term to be used.



A psychopath is not merely a term used to describe a person with a wicked personality. It is a mental health illness. It is thoroughly defined with the help of DSM-5 or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, 5th ed. Psychopathy, is a type of personality disorder. Personality disorder is a mental health illness that has something to do with a person’s maladaptive behavior towards his or her environment, this includes the people around him or her, and that prevents the person to function normally. In Psychopathy, the problem focuses on the person’s insistent antisocial behavior. Antisocial behavior is the lack of capacity or the need to isolate oneself from other people. Psychopaths are known to behave maladaptive with other people. They don’t socialize and building a relationship for them is the hardest thing to do. Their withdrawal towards their environment is characterized by egoistic desires thus they don’t feel remorse if they have to abandon a certain person or situation.

A psychopath is a type of mental illness but it isn’t different from being a diabetic or asthmatic, the only difference is that it has something to do with the mental and not on the physical state of the patient. Thus if you criticize and use it to describe your disappointment to a particular person, you are as if demeaning a person’s worth because of having a diabetes or asthma. It is a very serious matter that using it to disgrace a person must not be tolerated.

It is important to educate the people that mental health illnesses must not be taken lightly. People should stop from using such terms without being properly aware of how complex and sensitive it is. People with mental health issues never wished to have it within their system. Nobody wants to feel bad about one’s self, and yet it is often the great struggle of those who are suffering from such illnesses.

There are some in form of drink, coffee, candy, and many more. However none of these have truly proven to work in general. It is because each individual has his or her own mechanism in digesting food and metabolism which is responsible in regulating body weight. Aside from the uncertainty of patronizing dietary supplements such as pills, it is best to go organic and change your eating habits particularly your food plan. The best thing about choosing the natural way of losing weight is that it saves you from harmful chemicals and possible exposure to side effects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most common and most abundant resources to actually lose weight is none other than water. Yes, water is actually capable of making you lose weight. All you have to do is follow a certain daily schedule. But before that, what’s with water and that it can actually help in weight loss?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most common reason why people result to obesity or consuming too much amount of food is due to a very active appetite. Well, water in connection is actually good in suppressing your appetite. The more you crave for food the more you should drink water. By this, water can immediately fill in your stomach preventing you from having craving episodes. Although this may sound painful, sometimes your cravings are all in your head, the more you think about it the more you become hungry.

Replace them with water in the morning, lunch, afternoon, and lastly even during dinner. Remember that water can only do its purpose if you allow it to happen.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As much as possible choose to drink cold water instead of hot. Cold water can actually trigger your metabolism to work well because it will require your body to heat up or warm up, thus it promoted in burning more calories.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water is also known to rehydrate your body. But how do you rehydrate if you are properly hydrated? This means that you must undergo physical activities and burn those calories and rehydrate using water. By doing so, you are flushing those toxic materials inside your body in the form of sweat.

There were series of articles published about how this device made a huge threat on every person’s life. Although it may sound too much, but it is indeed true. The best example is the protocol being followed by airline companies. All passengers and crews are prohibited to charge their galaxy note 7 while on board. It is the first time that such protocol has been issued to ensure the safety of all passengers. This is how serious the case is.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months from its first launching, what happened to this very controversial device? A wide recall has been issued after it has been proved that these devices actually overheat and has a great tendency to explode. Recall on galaxy note 7 devices first took place in US. According to Samsung they are trying their best to provide and replace recalled devices as soon as possible. However after the recall there are still complains that the replaced units are still prone to overheat. There were incidents noted on this matter. One of the latest incidents is when a Southwest Airline was forced to go back barely ten minutes after its flight when a passenger’s device, a galaxy note 7 started to produce smoke and overheated. Passengers were then evacuated from the airline as part of their safety protocol.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Samsung however, did not give any official statement regarding this issue. According to them they must first see and examine those replaced devices and check it for themselves if it really exploded because of its batteries or the device mainly. They are also willing to offer their customers to replace their Galaxy Note 7 with other devices such as Samsung Galaxy S7.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Samsung has already issued recall on their galaxy note 7, there is no definite statement yet that these devices are safe for using. It is such dismay for every note lover because it has been one of the most anticipated devices of the note series. With this alone, it is as if galaxy note 7 is suffering from a very slow and painful death. Who would want to purchase this device if this can actually put your life in danger? No one would ever dare to risk for this device unless Samsung could finally clear this issue. It is quite surprising that when Samsung managed to become one of the best makers of smart phones, it is now that they experienced great distress.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is very unfortunate especially for those who experienced physical injuries from using this device. It is such a huge thing how come Samsung never had the chance to check on their products before releasing it to the public. How come up to this moment, even replaced devices are still prone to overheating? Unfortunately, these are questions that only Samsung could answer.

It is located in the Sulu Sea between the island of Agutaya and Cuyo. The Pamalican Island is found north of Palawan. It is part of a numerous groups of island which makes up the Cuyo Archipelago. Though it is a small island with an estimate of 500 meters width, it is considered as one of Philippines’ best island private resorts. Originally the island was a plantation until it was bought by a businessman named Andres Soriano Jr. It was then his children who made a decision to transform it into a private resort. At present, its totality now belongs to the resort which is owned by Sorianos called the Seven Seas Resort. It is also a branch of the Aman Resorts resort group nemd the Amanpulo.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Visitors, tourists and customers can get to the island via a plane coming from Manila. The Dornier 228-202K plane ferries people and supplies to the exclusive resort. Along with it comes personal buggies that takes visitors for a free ride round the island. What is remarkable about the Pamalican Island is its extremely calm and secluded atmosphere.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One of its main attractions are its diving sites and coral reefs. It also has a bio diversity of marine life including manta rays and giant turtles. On the north of the island the “Windsurf hut” offers surf boards and sail for customers. Surfers find the monsoon season which is usually from the months of November to May a very nice time to go for a surf since the winds would blow towards the shore.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aside from being one of Philippine’s best resorts the Pamalican Island stands as nominee for being one of the best in the world. People who have visited its resorts have said that the island itself looks like a green comet placed on white sand. The island is also famous for its purely natural ambience. It takes only an hour and a half to walk around the whole island. Sights of sharks and giant turtles on the shores are also frequent in the area. Tourists have found its experience to be a “retreat within a retreat”.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What makes the Pamalican island is the Amanpulo. It is a five star hotel and resort exclusive and under the ownership of 7 Seas Resort. The Amanpulo is a combination of Snaskrit and tagalong words which means peaceful islands. Celebrities, politicians and successful businessmen constantly visit the resort because of its unmatched privacy that it offers to people who are in need of it. Famous people including Micheal Jackson and Robert De Niro were even reported as having taken a vacation on the resort though it was never confirmed by the management.&nbsp;

They are always available for you and just for you only. There are three things that dogs love. First of course you as its human best friend, be happy because you are on the top of the list. Second, dogs love to play. It is up to you to define how our dogs play, some would enjoy and settle for short walks in the streets or somewhere where he can enjoy his eyes of things he find interesting. Lastly, dogs love to eat!&nbsp; However although you wanted to share everything to your lovely pet, there are some restrictions that you need to follow in giving your dog some treats.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are only few people who are not fond of chocolates. In fact almost all would get excited about it. Chocolates come in cakes, drinks, ice-creams and many more. But do you know that your most favorite flavor is actually bad for your dog? You could be torn on which is which, but as long as you will not share your chocolate with your dog, everything will be fine.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So what’s inside this chocolate that it can be bad for dogs yet humans love it so much? Chocolate is extracted from the cocoa fruit. Chocolates contain a certain compound called “Theobromine” which is actually a type of alkaloid. It is somewhat the same with caffeine, both are classified as stimulants. The problem occurs due to the inability of dogs to break this compound. Dogs don’t have the enzyme to metabolize Theobromine thus it stays within the dogs system and becomes toxic. Since it is considered as a stimulant, it affects the central nervous system (CNS) of your dog, causing increase in the level of blood pressure. This will then result to rapid heart rate, seizure, and vomiting, frequent urination, muscle twitching, hyperactive behavior, dehydration and many more. With all of these complications it can certainly put the dog into a fatal condition. In more of common terms, people would say that dogs are allergic to chocolates, dogs are not allergic to chocolates but chocolates are bad for them because there is no way for them to metabolize it.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover the amount of chocolates that can cause those complications mentioned above will actually depend on the size of your dog. Larger dogs may have a much higher tolerance with the toxicity of the compound. Meanwhile the small ones may are more likely to react even in small amount of chocolates. Before thinking of giving your dog some of your favorite sweets, think a thousand times before doing so. You are risking your dog’s life because of your inappropriate thoughts.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

And on December of the same year he retired from military service but went on to live in Manila. But Roosevelt regionalized the Philippine Army on July 26, 1941. He then reassigned MacArthur to stand as major general of the American Army naming Douglas as commander of the USAFFE. Within a day, Macarthur’s promotion to lieutenant was proclaimed. Afterwards he was promoted on December 20, 1941 as a general. Other known officers were also promoted during that time. Sutherland became major general and Hugh Casey became brigadier general. By July 31, 1941 over twenty two thousand troops had been assigned by the Philippine Department.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;General Douglas MacArthur’s famous ‘’I shall return’’ speech were a result of his escape from one of the most famous battles in the history of the Philippines known as the Fall of Bataan. In December 8, 1941 MacArthur was informed by Sutherland of the ambush on Pearl Harbor. Gen. George Marshall gave MacArthur orders to continue the original Rainbow Five war plan. But Douglas refused to follow the order. There were also requests of permission to hit bases owned by the Japanese from an Air Force commander but all were denied. They were confused on what to do next because of the attack that happened on Pearl Harbor. At noontime, Japanese Air crafts surprised and bombarded Clark Field and bases at the Iba Field and in a few days the US Air Force were all destroyed.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When the defense plans failed to stop the Japanese from taking Manila, the Filipino and U.S. Forces were called to retreat and bring all the war supplies to Bataan. MacArthur tried to lessen the Japanese speed in advancing but changed his mind when he saw the quick advancement of the Japanese and their superiority in battle against the Filipino troops. He called everyone to retreat to the Bataan peninsula to wait for reinforcements there. On December 24, 1941 the declaration of Manila as an open city was announced.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the next day, MacArthur had to transfer his headquarters to the fortresses of Corregidor due to the destruction of nearly all of the USAFFE bases. Many of the headquarters started to go for Bataan to leave MacArthur. Although the Filipino and Americans knew they were hopeless they still fought the Japanese. Some of them blamed MacArthur because of the failure but others believed he would find a way to get them out of the mess.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Japanese Army gradually neutralized most of the defenders of the Philippines on February in 1942. On the same year President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to move to Australia. He left with his family and major general Sutherland in PT boats away from Corregidor on March 12, 1942. They were received by B-17s and flew off to Australia. On March 20, 1942 he made his famous speech to return to the Philippine Islands. He was told by Washington to change the “I” on his statement to “we” but MacArthur refused it. In his speech he said, “ I came through and I shall return” stressing his resolve to redeem the Philippines from its enemies. &nbsp;Meanwhile, after a series of battles, Bataan fell to the hands of the Japanese Army.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;October 1944 gave MacArthur the chance he’d been waiting for. On the 20th of that month, and after efforts to be summoned by Roosevelt to Philippines, General Douglas was finally back in the Philippines. He landed on Leyte with the Sixth Army of Krueger’s troops where they waded on foot in the waters of the Leyte beach. He also made another famous speech where he reassured the Filipinos of his promise to eradicate their enemies once and for all. And after two months, the Japanese Army lost Leyte to the US Army.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

Its scientific name is the Pterocarpus. It is also known in other countries as the New Guinea Rosewood or Malay Paduak. Others call it Pashu Padauk. Among other countries aside from Philippines, the Narra is also found in Indonesia, China, Papua New Guinea and Malaysia.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The tree grows up from thirty up to forty meters high. It has a trunk with an average of two meters in diameter. It is a deciduous tree that is very large in structure. Its leaves are usually 12-22 centimeters long. The pinnate has 5 up to 11 leaflets with a girth that is 12 to 34 meters wide. The flowers of the narra grows in panicles which is 6 to 13 centimeters long. This panicle contains fe to some flowers. The months of the flowering of the Narra depends on the country where it grows. In Philippines the flowering takes place starting from February to May. The flowers are fragrant but only slightly. The normal color is yellow or sometimes orange-yellow. The flowers of Narra also grows fruits that are semiorbicular pods of 2 to 3 cm in diameter. They are surrounded by flat wings which are 4-6 cm in diameter. These wing-like figures helps in the dispersals of the wind.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Narra is considered as one of the national symbols of the Philippines. This is due to its variety in terms of uses and aids in the daily lives of the people. The constituents of the tree is known to yield “kino” which contains kinotannic acid. The woods are also known to yield othe constituents such as narrin, santalin and angolensin. The Narra is notable for its swiftness in growth and its strength in terms of hardness. It is the top hardest tree in the Philippines. Aside from that, it can grow well regardless if its planted on bottom lands. It is also remarkable for being less vulnerable to pests and diseases compared to other trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are some parts of Narra that are edible too. Its leaves and flowers are one of the examples. Also, the flowers have been reported as being a good source for honey. Aside from being edible, the narra tree offers medicinal aid to help heal diseases and other daily needs. For example, the infusion of its leaf can be used for making shampoo. It can also be used for treating diarrhea, stones, dropsy, sores and ailments in the bladder.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In other cases, the leaves of the Narra tree when they are still young can be boiled and used on boils, ulcers and prickly heat. The decoction of it can be used as aid for sore throats, as astringents or as mouthwash to treat toothaches. Bladder stones and dropsy can be dissolved too by the decoction of its leaves. Other benefits of the Narra can be taken from its resin which is a “kino” which can be used for the treatment of chronic diarrhea and hemorrhages.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The strength of the Narra tree is not only found in the physical structure of its body but also in the gentler parts which consists of the flowers and its leaves and fruits.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

So what are the new things that buyers should anticipate or expect for this device? Is it just similar to its predecessors or it has something very unique to offer? Much of these hunches, it seems like there are things that will totally surprise the people. The questions of will people be glad or mad about it, is surely something any interested buyer should take note.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One thing that is remarkably new about this device is the loss or absence of the headphone jack. Iphone7 did drop off the historic headphone jack in exchange of the iphone earpods. Users should expect for a wireless lightning earpods that works through bluetooth connection. Choosing to go wireless has drawn so much controversy to the Apple Company, yet their Marketing Chief Phil Schiller, stood firm and proud of the dynamic change of the Iphone7. According to Schiller, they decided to get rid of the traditional analog type of headphones not due to superficial reasons or perhaps to elicit an elegant style, but because the traditional design is consuming too much space for the device’s new processor. They have to let go of it and had the courage to go wireless.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, although it’s for the device’s own good in order to optimize its capacity, these lightning earpods are actually sold separately. Yes, you heard it right. Unlike the usual package when you buy a new device, Iphone7’s lightning earpods are not for free. So what’s the deal if you opt only for the device and you find it too costly to go for the lightning earpods? Well, you can still use your old headphones but it will take a quite turn before you can use it. You need to use an adapter that you have to connect through the charging port and connect your headphones on that adapter.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which would look like this:



&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s indeed quite a job and a bit hassle, especially when you choose to walk around with your headphones on. With this, one will surely decide to go for the lightning earpods, if and only if you have the budget for it.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

It has been part of the daily lives of the people, mostly by women. To look beautiful and presentable has always been part of any woman’s goals of the day. It is an unspoken rule that if you can’t be beautiful then be at least presentable. Whether you like it or not, first impression doesn’t only last, it really matters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is a sad reality that although these make-ups and cosmetics can make a person look more beautiful it contains chemicals that can actually take away your natural glow or natural beauty. Lipsticks contain certain compounds that can actually darken your lips and change its natural color. Other make-ups can also cause skin allergies or irritation and even cause skin impurities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good thing, organic make ups are now available in the market. You can now enjoy using these kinds of cosmetics without worrying of any side effects. Organic make-ups are proven to be safe and free from harmful chemicals. If you are thinking of shifting to organic make-ups there are things that you need to know so that you will not be left dissatisfied with your decision.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since organic makeups uses pure and organic materials, it is way more expensive compared to the ordinary make up products. But if this ensures the health of your skin, it is still a very good investment despite of its price. Also, there are only few choices for organic make-ups, such as lipstick shades. It is because unlike the ordinary type of cosmetics, organic make ups depend only on natural occurring colors which can be extracted from organic compounds. Commercial or ordinary cosmetics use artificial colors in order to achieve almost every shade that they want to produce. Also, organic make ups have shorter expiration periods. Again, because of being organic and free from chemicals, its shelf life is also affected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patronizing organic make up can actually be part of a healthy living lifestyle. The more you eliminate artificial chemicals within your daily routine the healthier you are. Organic products can never be beaten even by the most popular brand of make-up. Sometimes you don’t actually need to have full coverage of make-up foundation; sometimes you just have to make ways to make your skin healthier. Once you nourish it properly, you will no longer worry about acne breakouts, and other skin blemishes. Practice proper hygiene and start using products that are actually doing great for your skin inside and out.

Samsung on October 12, finally issued statement declaring the death of galaxy note 7.

The galaxy note 7 faced tons of complaints all over the world because of its tendency to explode. It has caused major threat to the safety of the people. As a result, a remarkable drop in sales has been noted for this device. In the interest of Samsung to preserve its customers, they tried to recall all galaxy note 7 that were sold to the public. Some of the remedy that they offered was to issue refund particularly for those customers who already lost interest in waiting for the galaxy note 7 to be back.
However, just a few days after the first few recalls were issued, another incident involving the device took place. A man using his galaxy note 7 begun to notice that his device was slowly emitting a smoke and it started to overheat. In happened inside a Southwest Aircraft, thus the airline company was forced to return to the airport because of the incident.
In previous statements, galaxy note 7 tend to overheat and explode upon charging, that it why all airline companies prohibit their passengers to charge their devices inside the aircraft using power banks and the likes. However with the latest case, the man wasn’t actually charging his device. He was just using it like the usual, yet it started to produce smoke inside the aircraft. Although, Samsung did not issued formal statement regarding the matter, they have promised to check on it and do the best that they can in solving such disastrous happenings.

Barely three days after the aircraft incident, Samsung has finally broke its silence by issuing a statement declaring the death of Samsung galaxy note 7. It is indeed a major disaster for the company to declare such thing however according to them it was the best thing that they can do to ensure the safety of the people. It is absolutely a major loss for them but they would like to assure the public that the safety of their consumers is much more important than their sales. They on the other hand, assured the public that the note series will still continue and that it is going to be better than ever, but as of now the galaxy note 7 is signing off.

One of the most talked about remarks was made by an actress, Ms. Agot Isidro. Ms. Isidro, in her Facebook status update, slammed the President for the statements he gave during one of his speeches. Aside from criticizing Duterte with his way of governance and his behavior to other foreign personalities, she ended her post by calling Duterte not a Bipolar but a Psychopath.

Ms. Isidro’s statement steamed over the social media. Several people expressed disagreement with her post not because of her remarks toward the President, but when she used the term Bipolar and Psychopath. The comments in general condemned Ms. Agot’s use of these terms without being aware of the weight of her statements. She is not an expert on such field yet she vocally used it as if it is just a common term to be used.



A psychopath is not merely a term used to describe a person with a wicked personality. It is a mental health illness. It is thoroughly defined with the help of DSM-5 or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, 5th ed. Psychopathy, is a type of personality disorder. Personality disorder is a mental health illness that has something to do with a person’s maladaptive behavior towards his or her environment, this includes the people around him or her, and that prevents the person to function normally. In Psychopathy, the problem focuses on the person’s insistent antisocial behavior. Antisocial behavior is the lack of capacity or the need to isolate oneself from other people. Psychopaths are known to behave maladaptive with other people. They don’t socialize and building a relationship for them is the hardest thing to do. Their withdrawal towards their environment is characterized by egoistic desires thus they don’t feel remorse if they have to abandon a certain person or situation.

A psychopath is a type of mental illness but it isn’t different from being a diabetic or asthmatic, the only difference is that it has something to do with the mental and not on the physical state of the patient. Thus if you criticize and use it to describe your disappointment to a particular person, you are as if demeaning a person’s worth because of having a diabetes or asthma. It is a very serious matter that using it to disgrace a person must not be tolerated.

It is important to educate the people that mental health illnesses must not be taken lightly. People should stop from using such terms without being properly aware of how complex and sensitive it is. People with mental health issues never wished to have it within their system. Nobody wants to feel bad about one’s self, and yet it is often the great struggle of those who are suffering from such illnesses.

There were series of articles published about how this device made a huge threat on every person’s life. Although it may sound too much, but it is indeed true. The best example is the protocol being followed by airline companies. All passengers and crews are prohibited to charge their galaxy note 7 while on board. It is the first time that such protocol has been issued to ensure the safety of all passengers. This is how serious the case is.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months from its first launching, what happened to this very controversial device? A wide recall has been issued after it has been proved that these devices actually overheat and has a great tendency to explode. Recall on galaxy note 7 devices first took place in US. According to Samsung they are trying their best to provide and replace recalled devices as soon as possible. However after the recall there are still complains that the replaced units are still prone to overheat. There were incidents noted on this matter. One of the latest incidents is when a Southwest Airline was forced to go back barely ten minutes after its flight when a passenger’s device, a galaxy note 7 started to produce smoke and overheated. Passengers were then evacuated from the airline as part of their safety protocol.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Samsung however, did not give any official statement regarding this issue. According to them they must first see and examine those replaced devices and check it for themselves if it really exploded because of its batteries or the device mainly. They are also willing to offer their customers to replace their Galaxy Note 7 with other devices such as Samsung Galaxy S7.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Samsung has already issued recall on their galaxy note 7, there is no definite statement yet that these devices are safe for using. It is such dismay for every note lover because it has been one of the most anticipated devices of the note series. With this alone, it is as if galaxy note 7 is suffering from a very slow and painful death. Who would want to purchase this device if this can actually put your life in danger? No one would ever dare to risk for this device unless Samsung could finally clear this issue. It is quite surprising that when Samsung managed to become one of the best makers of smart phones, it is now that they experienced great distress.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is very unfortunate especially for those who experienced physical injuries from using this device. It is such a huge thing how come Samsung never had the chance to check on their products before releasing it to the public. How come up to this moment, even replaced devices are still prone to overheating? Unfortunately, these are questions that only Samsung could answer.
