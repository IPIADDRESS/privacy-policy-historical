This statement of privacy covers how magTXT treats personal information collected and received, including information relating to the past use of our services. &quot;Personal Information&quot; refers to information that personally identifies you by your name, email address or phone number and other information that is not otherwise available publicly. This statement of privacy applies only to the practices of magTXT and the people we employ or manage. Other websites or services linked to/from this website will have their own statements of privacy which can be viewed on their respective privacy links.&nbsp;


Privacy Policy&nbsp;
We at magTXT, have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your personal information and informing you about how we handle it. This privacy policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on the magTXT Website. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. This privacy policy was last revised on 5th of August 2012. Each time you visit the site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.&nbsp;


Your IP Address&nbsp;
Each time you visit the site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the site for you and to diagnose problems with our site, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you.&nbsp;


Cookies&nbsp;
magTXT may use cookies (a small file placed on your computer’s hard drive) that enables us to collect information which pages you find useful and which you do not.&nbsp;
Cookies are also needed for login and registration. magTXT and other third parties such as our advertisers may also use cookies to serve ads to you based on your visit to our website.&nbsp;
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. To opt out of Google’s use of cookies, please visit Google ad and content network privacy policy.&nbsp;
Third party advertisers on the site may also place or read cookies on your browser. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas on the site.&nbsp;
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our website as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.&nbsp;
Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.&nbsp;


DoubleClick DART Cookies&nbsp;
magTXT also use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer’s hard drive when you are browsing this website using DoubleClick advertising such as Google Adsense advertisements.&nbsp;
This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (“interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history. DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your bank account numbers or credit card numbers and etc. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all websites using this advertising by visiting http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/.&nbsp;


Information We Collect From You&nbsp;
In order to operate the site and to provide you with information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we may collect &quot;personal information&quot;, &quot;financial information&quot; or &quot;demographic information&quot;, subject to the rest of this paragraph. We ask that you do not enter personal information or financial information into your profile, because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the site, and the information will then be treated as &quot;demographic information&quot; that is &quot;public information.&quot; Please note that nowhere on the site do we knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18, as we require that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years old.&nbsp;


Information Other websites Collect From You&nbsp;
On the site, we place links to other websites operated by other parties. Some of these other websites contain our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit these other websites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that we do not control these other websites or these other websites' business practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other websites. Consequently, the operators of these other websites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were collected on the site. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.&nbsp;


How We Use Personal Information&nbsp;
We use your personal information to help us efficiently operate the site, to contact you in connection with your transactions and other activities on the site including, but not limited to, confirmation emails or important news that could affect your relationship with magTXT, and to forward messages to you from other magTXT users. These types of communications, are known as &quot;Operational Communications.&quot; In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner advertisements and special offers.&nbsp;

By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by third parties on the site, or electing to receive communications or electing to participate in contests, or other reward programs, offered or sponsored by third parties on the site, you consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties. Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us.&nbsp;

In some cases, we may enter into a promotional relationship with another company in which we prominently display their brand name or trademarks on pages of the site. These pages are known as &quot;Co-Branded Pages&quot; and these companies are known as Co-Branded Companies. If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share your personal information with the associated Co-Branded Company. Co-Branded Companies may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact Co-Branded Companies to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such Co-Branded Companies in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us. Some Co-Branded Pages may contain an action tag (also known as a Web Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file) that a third party, such as the advertising company Avenue A, may use to read cookies that it, or its clients, may have placed on your browser at other (non-magTXT) web sites before your visit to magTXT. This technology is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements on such other websites that promote Co-Branded Pages.&nbsp;

Any third party with whom we are allowed to share your personal information is authorized to use your personal information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.&nbsp;


How do We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information&nbsp;
We may review all demographic information. We may use public information to enable other users to find your profile, to determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We may use demographic information to tailor the site and communications to your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis. One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to magTXT users, so that we may target specific advertisements at specific demographic groups. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous, subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic group. Please also be aware that when we disclose your financial information or personal information to a Co-Branded Company, as described above, we may also disclose to that Co-Branded Company your demographic information, other than the content of one-on-one communications between you and other members. Please also be aware that we may disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis.&nbsp;


Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information&nbsp;
If at any point we decide to use particular personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email or by providing 30 days notice on the site. Please note that we will continue to have the right to change our privacy policy and practices, and how we use your personally identifiable information, without notice, as described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, provided that such changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the change.&nbsp;


For any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, the practices of the site, or your dealings with the site, you can contact us at magTXT@gmail.com.

In Spanish it is called the Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno. In Filipino it is known as Mahal na Itim na Nazareno or Itim na Nazareno. But its formal name in English is “Our Father Jesus Nazarene”. The black Nazarene is wooden sculpture of Jesus Christ. It is a life-sized figure carrying the cross. Filipino Catholics believe the wooden figure to be possessed with miraculous nature.
In the beginning the Black Nazarene had a fair complexion. But because of a fire that burned the ship it was carried on, it turned black. Luckily, the sculpture survived. The sculptor of the image has always been unanimous. According to history, it was brought to Manila from Acapulco, Mexico via a galleon ship.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Originally, the Black Nazarene had an identical twin sculpture which was brought to Manila. This is found in the Intramuros district church records. It is said that the first one kept in Bagumbayan’s San Nicolas de Tolentino church before it was transferred to Intramuros. Unfortunately the Battle of Manila in 1945 destroyed this first image of the Black Nazarene when a bomb hit it. By then, the other sculpture was placed in the Quiapo church where some people thought it to be the original one. In the year 1650 Pope Innocent X gave his approval of the Black Nazarene for veneration as Sacramental. He also gave the permission to the Confraternity of the Most Holy Jesus Nazarene.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Filipino Catholics and those who relate to the Passion of Christ venerate the Black Nazarene. Most of them would relate their hardships to the struggles that were experienced by Jesus himself such the one presented in the image of the statue. Devotees clap their hands after the offering of mass at the shrine as a sign of homage.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Three processions take place each year when the Black Nazarene is taken out for veneration. The procession takes place on New Year’s Day, January 9 and Good Friday. January 9 processions commemorate the transferring of the Nazarene to Quiapo church. On that day, the image is carried out to the street in a carriage called the “andas” which means “to go forward” in Spanish. The devotees would walk barefoot and wear maroon colored clothes as an act of reminiscing Jesus when he went to Mount Calvary. The carriage is tied with a rope which men would pull. In the past only men were allowed to pull the ropes but recently female devotees joined in the act. The Catholics would touch the image hoping for a miracle to happen. Some people allegedly have even been reported to have had their diseases cured after contact with the Nazarene. Because of this, desperate devotees who can’t get near the statue would throw their towels at the guards requesting them to rub it on the image hoping that its miracles would rub in the cloth. The procession of the Black Nazarene on feast day is known to be a fatal one because of the heat, fatigue and the massive numbers of devotees reaching to millions.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately, when the number of devotees rose to 8 million, the route on the 9th January was altered to a much wider street located at the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park. This is also the first place where the Nazarene was enshrined. At the end of the day, the statue is returned to the church. In contrast to this veneration, the other two commemoration of the Black Nazarene on New Year’s Day and Good Friday is a solemn one.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

Although less attention is given to middle children during child rearing, middle children became an interesting target for research because of their complicated situation. Children who were born on such order have great qualities especially when it comes to coping and socialization. But what are the most common traits that makes up a middle child?
Here is the list:


1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;A part of you will always feel that nobody cares about you – it is the most fundamental feeling that the middle children share. It starts when you just don’t know who or what you should be. The parents are busy making your older sibling responsible and at the same time they are busy looking after and enjoying your younger sibling.&nbsp;


2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You were used to being alone but you are not even sad about it – although not all middle children are introverts, there is a strong force that pushes a middle child to enjoy a moment of himself or herself to meditate or to think of plans especially when a decision has to be made.&nbsp;

3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
You talk to yourself vocally – although it wasn’t intentional, most middle kids were not given the chance to voice out their opinion because it is the job of the older sibling and such decisions are actually made for the benefit of the youngest child. In a way, middle children have been used to voice out their thoughts to their selves alone. They do it because they actually value listening to opinion since they weren’t given that chance when they were young.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;

You always think that you are not your parents’ favorite – parental biases will always take place no matter how many times parents say that they don’t have favoritism among their children. Meanwhile, the middles would voluntarily take the place of not being the favorite child or the less appreciated one because they have been used to sacrifice &nbsp;ever since they became a middle child.

5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It always comes to you to consider other people’s feelings before you make any decision – although this may sound too kind this is actually true for almost all middle kids. Since they were used to get caught in the middle they learned how it feels to be on top of someone and at the same time find themselves in the bottom.&nbsp;

6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
You feel a bit distant and secretive to your own family – this is a thing that only middle children could understand. It may sound rebellious but it is not. Since they were used being left behind or that their opinions don’t really matter at all, they become cautious in opening up or trusting a family member. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Recall of Galaxy Note 7.</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A few days after the recent launching of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, several complaints were already raised against one of the most anticipated smartphones of today’s era. Due to the severity of the issue Samsung decided to replace all sold units of galaxy note 7. It was when the first few customers of the product experienced issues with its battery. It happens to overheat during the charging of device. It actually explodes making it a very hazard one when it comes to safety and security issues. People are now questioning how was it able to pass the quality control standards? To note, this is the first time that Samsung experienced this kind of incident. Is it a sign that Samsung is now lowering its quality to take lead on its number one adversary? Definitely this occurrence stained Samsung’s most valued reputation.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is such dismay that Samsung wasn’t able to detect this problem before launching it to the public. Aside from the recall for sold items, marketing of Galaxy Note 7 has been stopped for the meantime. People are now confused as to how their devices can be replaced and how long would it take them to wait. As of the moment Galaxy Note 7 has already sold quite a number of units.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to some tech analysts, Samsung was trying to get ahead of the release of Iphone 7; unfortunately it turned out to be a disaster instead of advancing from its opponent. However several people would still want to wait for the release of the new device provided that all issues shall be resolved before making it available to the public.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With this scenario, one could essentially realize the downside of being too excited and hunching for the release of the latest device. Although it pays off being updated, not to mention showing off its newest features, but how are these people going to deal with their devices? Returning their devices doesn’t mean they can also have their money back. Rather they need to wait for a certain period of time before they can eventually have their paid items back unto their hands.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Several memes surfaced in the internet and although it may seem ridiculous, you will surely get it on point. Will Galaxy Note lovers remain loyal to their adored devices? We will find out in the next few days.&nbsp;

Regardless of the situation a person would always want to have someone to be with. Nobody wants to be left behind. However not all people are lucky enough to find their companions or best friends in life because of varied reasons. But who says only a human being can complete another human being? Dogs are great companions too and they have earned the title of being man’s best friend since time immemorial.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are thinking of having a dog and you don’t have any breed in particular to choose from it is best to have a rescue dog. A rescue dog is basically a dog which came from sanctuaries or those that were saved from being abandoned. These types of dogs have no definite breed at all. You might never able to trace its pedigree and its bloodline; however they are as special as those being commercialized in pet stores.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The best thing about choosing rescue dogs is that you are giving them the second chance to live a life that they have been wishing for. There are only few people who would choose to adopt dogs rather than shop. This only means that there are also only few dogs that would be given the chance to have their forever home. It is also heartbreaking to know that not all shelters practice the no-kill policy. When rescued dogs remain in the shelter for quite long already, they are euthanize or being put to sleep without even experiencing the joy of being part in a family.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Adopting a dog from shelters could be the best decision you can ever think of. If you are longing for a companion or a best friend, they are just perfect. These dogs have painful experiences in their past but they are still hopeful to find that special person who will prove to them that dogs are indeed man’s best friend.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By getting a rescue dog, you are helping organizations to continue their goals in putting an end to animal cruelty and animal neglect. If you are thinking that dogs that came from shelters are problematic dogs then you are wrong. Although most of them are strays, these dogs were given the medication they needed before they are released and are set for adoption. It is also a protocol for any shelter to spay and neuter every rescue dog under their facility. By doing this, dogs are protected from unplanned pregnancies and over population which then may result to neglect.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are several animal welfare groups in the Philippines such as the Philippine Animal Rescue Team (http://www.philanimalrescue.org/) where you can finally meet your new best friend. Pay them a visit now; they are all waiting for you.&nbsp;</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

There are some in form of drink, coffee, candy, and many more. However none of these have truly proven to work in general. It is because each individual has his or her own mechanism in digesting food and metabolism which is responsible in regulating body weight. Aside from the uncertainty of patronizing dietary supplements such as pills, it is best to go organic and change your eating habits particularly your food plan. The best thing about choosing the natural way of losing weight is that it saves you from harmful chemicals and possible exposure to side effects.

Replace them with water in the morning, lunch, afternoon, and lastly even during dinner. Remember that water can only do its purpose if you allow it to happen.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As much as possible choose to drink cold water instead of hot. Cold water can actually trigger your metabolism to work well because it will require your body to heat up or warm up, thus it promoted in burning more calories.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water is also known to rehydrate your body. But how do you rehydrate if you are properly hydrated? This means that you must undergo physical activities and burn those calories and rehydrate using water. By doing so, you are flushing those toxic materials inside your body in the form of sweat.

There are still things that are seemingly odd in nature and there are also some that are quite deceiving. Take for example this Emerald Green Cat that was discovered in a small town in Bulgaria.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The town people and even people from far cities are quite familiar with this seemingly odd creature because of its color. The cat has been spotted walking around the city, it gives the town people the impression that it is a stray and it only gets its food by roaming around the place.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to its distinct color and possible breakthrough in the feline world, people from far countries travelled to Bulgaria just to take a closer peek and even take some pictures of it. However, this cat’s stardom started to fade when rainstorms came. Its bright emerald green color slowly faded away when rain started to fall.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been found out that the cat got its color from a barrel of paint where it sleeps. Although paints contain toxins that are eventually not good for the health, the cat was actually in good shape all throughout its stardom. With its color fading away, its popularity indeed started to slow down, however its quite noticeable she enjoyed her moment and made the most of it by gaining extra pounds.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the time, mobile apps are being installed because of its popularity. When a wide audience seemed to use it even for just a short time, you should expect for others to try it too without really verifying its security measures.&nbsp;

SARAHAH Honesty App is supposedly an app that can be used in giving feedbacks anonymously. Seems like people nowadays are drawn into intriguing stuff more than ever. However accordingly the app works in such a way that the person who has been rated or given feedback has no way of tracing or replying to it. The creator of the app tend to give its users the chance to leave positive comments or feedbacks as an act of kindness while keeping their identity unknown.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However the entire community has been totally shocked (shookt) when it has been revealed that this app is actually unknowingly stealing your personal details such as your contact list. Aside from stealing, they make use of it by uploading it to their data base and who knows what they could do about it.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you installed this app, it will only take them a while to steal your info. Logging out from the app can't make any difference at all. The best thing to do is to never ever install it and be more cautious in choosing an app.&nbsp;

The victims are residents of Cabdbaran Agusan del Sur.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the intent to enhance and beautify themselves, they decided to undergo treatment from a person whom they barely know. The procedure went by injecting some unknown chemicals unto their faces. However instead of having better and beautiful faces, it went really worse and appeared distorted. The three of them have the same reaction with the chemical.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the help of their friends and families, they are now trying to reach a certain amount in order to help the victims. Aside from the horrible outcome of what happened, the victims are now starting to become ill and are all afraid of what could happen to them if not given the proper care.


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, the suspect is now nowhere to be found. The victims were not even aware of the suspect’s whereabouts.


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the one who posted, a certain media will then cover the story of these women, to inform and especially warn those who would dare to undergo such procedure. The suspect was not a licensed medical professional but because of cheaper rates he managed to convince these ladies to try it all for the aim of becoming beautiful.&nbsp;

Almost all snacks were made out of sugar, chocolates and other forms of sweeteners. It is the main reason why Skittles stands out from the rest of the group. It is a sweet yet sour candy that comes in a bright rainbow colors. But all of a sudden Skittles became really dull and lost all that rainbow colors.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In an official stamen made by Skittles, they decided to have a different packaging for intended for the entire month of June. As practiced June is the month dedicated for the LGBT community. The LGBT community has the rainbow to represent them because they acknowledged that they are composed of different genders thus constitutes not just a single color but of different colors.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Since the Skittles and the LGBT community share the same kind of color representation, Skittles gladly gave way to the LGBT community. According to them, although the share the same symbol, one has to stand out and celebrate their existence and they give it whole heartedly to the LGBT group.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is such a remarkable and thoughtful move for Skittles. Although they were branded and known because of their color, they were not afraid to give way to celebrate a significant event for some people. Consumers in return have shown appreciation to what the company did. Their customers admired their sensitive and immediate decision to honor the LGBT community.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Changing brand packaging is a bit risky when it comes to sales and market. Well known and established companies see to it that when they have to change or modify their packaging it needs to be somehow close to the previous design. It is because people shop out of familiarity. When you change your packaging into a totally different concept, chances are your consumers will not be able to recognize your products anymore.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However it is different with the case of Skittles. They dared to risk their sales and their brand in order to commemorate an event. With this making rounds in the internet, Skittles is rest assured that their customers would still remain loyal to them.&nbsp;

In Spanish it is called the Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno. In Filipino it is known as Mahal na Itim na Nazareno or Itim na Nazareno. But its formal name in English is “Our Father Jesus Nazarene”. The black Nazarene is wooden sculpture of Jesus Christ. It is a life-sized figure carrying the cross. Filipino Catholics believe the wooden figure to be possessed with miraculous nature.
In the beginning the Black Nazarene had a fair complexion. But because of a fire that burned the ship it was carried on, it turned black. Luckily, the sculpture survived. The sculptor of the image has always been unanimous. According to history, it was brought to Manila from Acapulco, Mexico via a galleon ship.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Originally, the Black Nazarene had an identical twin sculpture which was brought to Manila. This is found in the Intramuros district church records. It is said that the first one kept in Bagumbayan’s San Nicolas de Tolentino church before it was transferred to Intramuros. Unfortunately the Battle of Manila in 1945 destroyed this first image of the Black Nazarene when a bomb hit it. By then, the other sculpture was placed in the Quiapo church where some people thought it to be the original one. In the year 1650 Pope Innocent X gave his approval of the Black Nazarene for veneration as Sacramental. He also gave the permission to the Confraternity of the Most Holy Jesus Nazarene.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Filipino Catholics and those who relate to the Passion of Christ venerate the Black Nazarene. Most of them would relate their hardships to the struggles that were experienced by Jesus himself such the one presented in the image of the statue. Devotees clap their hands after the offering of mass at the shrine as a sign of homage.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Three processions take place each year when the Black Nazarene is taken out for veneration. The procession takes place on New Year’s Day, January 9 and Good Friday. January 9 processions commemorate the transferring of the Nazarene to Quiapo church. On that day, the image is carried out to the street in a carriage called the “andas” which means “to go forward” in Spanish. The devotees would walk barefoot and wear maroon colored clothes as an act of reminiscing Jesus when he went to Mount Calvary. The carriage is tied with a rope which men would pull. In the past only men were allowed to pull the ropes but recently female devotees joined in the act. The Catholics would touch the image hoping for a miracle to happen. Some people allegedly have even been reported to have had their diseases cured after contact with the Nazarene. Because of this, desperate devotees who can’t get near the statue would throw their towels at the guards requesting them to rub it on the image hoping that its miracles would rub in the cloth. The procession of the Black Nazarene on feast day is known to be a fatal one because of the heat, fatigue and the massive numbers of devotees reaching to millions.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately, when the number of devotees rose to 8 million, the route on the 9th January was altered to a much wider street located at the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park. This is also the first place where the Nazarene was enshrined. At the end of the day, the statue is returned to the church. In contrast to this veneration, the other two commemoration of the Black Nazarene on New Year’s Day and Good Friday is a solemn one.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

Although less attention is given to middle children during child rearing, middle children became an interesting target for research because of their complicated situation. Children who were born on such order have great qualities especially when it comes to coping and socialization. But what are the most common traits that makes up a middle child?
Here is the list:


1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;A part of you will always feel that nobody cares about you – it is the most fundamental feeling that the middle children share. It starts when you just don’t know who or what you should be. The parents are busy making your older sibling responsible and at the same time they are busy looking after and enjoying your younger sibling.&nbsp;


2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You were used to being alone but you are not even sad about it – although not all middle children are introverts, there is a strong force that pushes a middle child to enjoy a moment of himself or herself to meditate or to think of plans especially when a decision has to be made.&nbsp;

3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
You talk to yourself vocally – although it wasn’t intentional, most middle kids were not given the chance to voice out their opinion because it is the job of the older sibling and such decisions are actually made for the benefit of the youngest child. In a way, middle children have been used to voice out their thoughts to their selves alone. They do it because they actually value listening to opinion since they weren’t given that chance when they were young.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;

You always think that you are not your parents’ favorite – parental biases will always take place no matter how many times parents say that they don’t have favoritism among their children. Meanwhile, the middles would voluntarily take the place of not being the favorite child or the less appreciated one because they have been used to sacrifice &nbsp;ever since they became a middle child.

5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It always comes to you to consider other people’s feelings before you make any decision – although this may sound too kind this is actually true for almost all middle kids. Since they were used to get caught in the middle they learned how it feels to be on top of someone and at the same time find themselves in the bottom.&nbsp;

6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
You feel a bit distant and secretive to your own family – this is a thing that only middle children could understand. It may sound rebellious but it is not. Since they were used being left behind or that their opinions don’t really matter at all, they become cautious in opening up or trusting a family member. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Recall of Galaxy Note 7.</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A few days after the recent launching of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, several complaints were already raised against one of the most anticipated smartphones of today’s era. Due to the severity of the issue Samsung decided to replace all sold units of galaxy note 7. It was when the first few customers of the product experienced issues with its battery. It happens to overheat during the charging of device. It actually explodes making it a very hazard one when it comes to safety and security issues. People are now questioning how was it able to pass the quality control standards? To note, this is the first time that Samsung experienced this kind of incident. Is it a sign that Samsung is now lowering its quality to take lead on its number one adversary? Definitely this occurrence stained Samsung’s most valued reputation.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is such dismay that Samsung wasn’t able to detect this problem before launching it to the public. Aside from the recall for sold items, marketing of Galaxy Note 7 has been stopped for the meantime. People are now confused as to how their devices can be replaced and how long would it take them to wait. As of the moment Galaxy Note 7 has already sold quite a number of units.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to some tech analysts, Samsung was trying to get ahead of the release of Iphone 7; unfortunately it turned out to be a disaster instead of advancing from its opponent. However several people would still want to wait for the release of the new device provided that all issues shall be resolved before making it available to the public.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With this scenario, one could essentially realize the downside of being too excited and hunching for the release of the latest device. Although it pays off being updated, not to mention showing off its newest features, but how are these people going to deal with their devices? Returning their devices doesn’t mean they can also have their money back. Rather they need to wait for a certain period of time before they can eventually have their paid items back unto their hands.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Several memes surfaced in the internet and although it may seem ridiculous, you will surely get it on point. Will Galaxy Note lovers remain loyal to their adored devices? We will find out in the next few days.&nbsp;

Regardless of the situation a person would always want to have someone to be with. Nobody wants to be left behind. However not all people are lucky enough to find their companions or best friends in life because of varied reasons. But who says only a human being can complete another human being? Dogs are great companions too and they have earned the title of being man’s best friend since time immemorial.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are thinking of having a dog and you don’t have any breed in particular to choose from it is best to have a rescue dog. A rescue dog is basically a dog which came from sanctuaries or those that were saved from being abandoned. These types of dogs have no definite breed at all. You might never able to trace its pedigree and its bloodline; however they are as special as those being commercialized in pet stores.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The best thing about choosing rescue dogs is that you are giving them the second chance to live a life that they have been wishing for. There are only few people who would choose to adopt dogs rather than shop. This only means that there are also only few dogs that would be given the chance to have their forever home. It is also heartbreaking to know that not all shelters practice the no-kill policy. When rescued dogs remain in the shelter for quite long already, they are euthanize or being put to sleep without even experiencing the joy of being part in a family.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Adopting a dog from shelters could be the best decision you can ever think of. If you are longing for a companion or a best friend, they are just perfect. These dogs have painful experiences in their past but they are still hopeful to find that special person who will prove to them that dogs are indeed man’s best friend.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By getting a rescue dog, you are helping organizations to continue their goals in putting an end to animal cruelty and animal neglect. If you are thinking that dogs that came from shelters are problematic dogs then you are wrong. Although most of them are strays, these dogs were given the medication they needed before they are released and are set for adoption. It is also a protocol for any shelter to spay and neuter every rescue dog under their facility. By doing this, dogs are protected from unplanned pregnancies and over population which then may result to neglect.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are several animal welfare groups in the Philippines such as the Philippine Animal Rescue Team (http://www.philanimalrescue.org/) where you can finally meet your new best friend. Pay them a visit now; they are all waiting for you.&nbsp;</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

It is because each individual has his or her own mechanism in digesting food and metabolism which is responsible in regulating body weight.

Replace them with water in the morning, lunch, afternoon, and lastly even during dinner. Remember that water can only do its purpose if you allow it to happen.

There are still things that are seemingly odd in nature and there are also some that are quite deceiving. Take for example this Emerald Green Cat that was discovered in a small town in Bulgaria.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The town people and even people from far cities are quite familiar with this seemingly odd creature because of its color. The cat has been spotted walking around the city, it gives the town people the impression that it is a stray and it only gets its food by roaming around the place.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to its distinct color and possible breakthrough in the feline world, people from far countries travelled to Bulgaria just to take a closer peek and even take some pictures of it. However, this cat’s stardom started to fade when rainstorms came. Its bright emerald green color slowly faded away when rain started to fall.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been found out that the cat got its color from a barrel of paint where it sleeps. Although paints contain toxins that are eventually not good for the health, the cat was actually in good shape all throughout its stardom. With its color fading away, its popularity indeed started to slow down, however its quite noticeable she enjoyed her moment and made the most of it by gaining extra pounds.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the time, mobile apps are being installed because of its popularity. When a wide audience seemed to use it even for just a short time, you should expect for others to try it too without really verifying its security measures.&nbsp;

SARAHAH Honesty App is supposedly an app that can be used in giving feedbacks anonymously. Seems like people nowadays are drawn into intriguing stuff more than ever. However accordingly the app works in such a way that the person who has been rated or given feedback has no way of tracing or replying to it. The creator of the app tend to give its users the chance to leave positive comments or feedbacks as an act of kindness while keeping their identity unknown.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However the entire community has been totally shocked (shookt) when it has been revealed that this app is actually unknowingly stealing your personal details such as your contact list. Aside from stealing, they make use of it by uploading it to their data base and who knows what they could do about it.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you installed this app, it will only take them a while to steal your info. Logging out from the app can't make any difference at all. The best thing to do is to never ever install it and be more cautious in choosing an app.&nbsp;

The victims are residents of Cabdbaran Agusan del Sur.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the intent to enhance and beautify themselves, they decided to undergo treatment from a person whom they barely know. The procedure went by injecting some unknown chemicals unto their faces. However instead of having better and beautiful faces, it went really worse and appeared distorted. The three of them have the same reaction with the chemical.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the help of their friends and families, they are now trying to reach a certain amount in order to help the victims. Aside from the horrible outcome of what happened, the victims are now starting to become ill and are all afraid of what could happen to them if not given the proper care.


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, the suspect is now nowhere to be found. The victims were not even aware of the suspect’s whereabouts.


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the one who posted, a certain media will then cover the story of these women, to inform and especially warn those who would dare to undergo such procedure. The suspect was not a licensed medical professional but because of cheaper rates he managed to convince these ladies to try it all for the aim of becoming beautiful.&nbsp;

Almost all snacks were made out of sugar, chocolates and other forms of sweeteners. It is the main reason why Skittles stands out from the rest of the group. It is a sweet yet sour candy that comes in a bright rainbow colors. But all of a sudden Skittles became really dull and lost all that rainbow colors.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In an official stamen made by Skittles, they decided to have a different packaging for intended for the entire month of June. As practiced June is the month dedicated for the LGBT community. The LGBT community has the rainbow to represent them because they acknowledged that they are composed of different genders thus constitutes not just a single color but of different colors.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Since the Skittles and the LGBT community share the same kind of color representation, Skittles gladly gave way to the LGBT community. According to them, although the share the same symbol, one has to stand out and celebrate their existence and they give it whole heartedly to the LGBT group.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is such a remarkable and thoughtful move for Skittles. Although they were branded and known because of their color, they were not afraid to give way to celebrate a significant event for some people. Consumers in return have shown appreciation to what the company did. Their customers admired their sensitive and immediate decision to honor the LGBT community.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Changing brand packaging is a bit risky when it comes to sales and market. Well known and established companies see to it that when they have to change or modify their packaging it needs to be somehow close to the previous design. It is because people shop out of familiarity. When you change your packaging into a totally different concept, chances are your consumers will not be able to recognize your products anymore.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However it is different with the case of Skittles. They dared to risk their sales and their brand in order to commemorate an event. With this making rounds in the internet, Skittles is rest assured that their customers would still remain loyal to them.&nbsp;
