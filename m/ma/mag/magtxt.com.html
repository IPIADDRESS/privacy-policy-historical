<br>
<br>
<br><b>Special Cases in which we Share Personal and Financial Information</b>
<br>Your personal information or financial information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy. We may also disclose personal information or financial information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of magTXT.com or other visitors to the site. We also may disclose your personal information or financial information to our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom we are under common corporate control.

<br>
<br>
<br><b>How do We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information</b>
<br>We may review all demographic information. We may use public information to enable other users to find your profile, to determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We may use demographic information to tailor the site and communications to your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis. One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to magTXT.com users, so that we may target specific advertisements at specific demographic groups. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous, subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic group. Please also be aware that when we disclose your financial information or personal information to a Co-Branded Company, as described above, we may also disclose to that Co-Branded Company your demographic information, other than the content of one-on-one communications between you and other members. Please also be aware that we may disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information</b>
<br>If at any point we decide to use particular personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email or by providing 30 days notice on the site. Please note that we will continue to have the right to change our privacy policy and practices, and how we use your personally identifiable information, without notice, as described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, provided that such changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the change.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>How You Can Access and Update Your Email Preferences, Personal Information and Public Information</b>
<br>We give you the opportunity to opt-out of certain communications and modify personal information or demographic information you have provided to us, and to hide demographic information from, or make demographic information visible to, the public users of the site, at anytime by going to the section of the site. Please be aware that it may take several hours for the changes you make to take effect on the public areas of the site. We thank you for your patience. Please note that changing or deleting your information through the "Account Settings" or "My Profile" section of the site, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of email communications from magTXT.com, will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes of future activities on the site and for managing future communications from magTXT.com.
