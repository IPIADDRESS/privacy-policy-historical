<b>What personally identifiable information is collected?</b><br>
<small>
We do not currently require users to provide
any personally identifying information (name, email address,
street address, etc.) to use the MagPortal.com service.
In the future, we may require such information
in exchange for providing additional services, such
as but not limited to: delivery of physical products,
entrance into a sweepstakes, or the privilege of posting
on message boards.  If you send correspondence to
us, we may store a copy (which means that we will have
your email address and name).

</p><p>

<b>What are cookies and how are they used on MagPortal.com?</b><br>
<small>
A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent from
a web site such as MagPortal.com to your computer where it is
stored on your hard drive.  When you access that web site
in the future, your browser sends that cookie back to
the web site, which allows the site to recognize you as
someone it has seen before.
</small></p><p><small>
MagPortal.com makes use of cookies so that it can provide you
with personalized services such as 
<a href="/cgi-bin/myart.cgi">My Articles</a>.
We may also use cookies to help us monitor your use of MagPortal.com
for the purpose of generating aggregated statistics and
targeted advertising and content on our site in order
to increase its usefulness to you.
</small></p><p><small>
Please be aware that our advertisers and service providers 
may use cookies of their own which we do not control (more
information is given below).
</small></p><p><small>
If you do not wish to have MagPortal.com use cookies to
identify you, you can turn off cookies in your browser.
Disabling cookies will make some personalization features
of MagPortal.com unusable.

<b>How are IP addresses used?</b><br>
<small>
An IP address is a set of numbers assigned to your
computer when you connect to the internet.
</small></p><p><small>
The MagPortal.com
site records the IP addresses of people using the
site.  This information may be used for monitoring
the use of the site or reporting aggregated statistics.
This information may also be used when we feel it
is necessary to protect our site, enforce our
<a href="/help/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>,
or enforce the law.

<b>Advertisers and Third Parties</b><br>
<small>
Please be aware that advertisers on MagPortal.com
and third party sites which MagPortal.com links
to are not subject to the MagPortal.com privacy policy.
Our advertisers may use cookies for various reasons.
They may, for example, use cookies to avoid showing you the same
advertisement many times, to measure which ads you respond to, or
to track your behavior when you leave the MagPortal.com site.
