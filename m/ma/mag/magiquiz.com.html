<p class="p8">We collect User Information across our Services, including as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul1" style="font-size: 18px;">
<li class="li12" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">If you sign up for an email subscription on our Services, we collect your email address and may also collect other information about your subscription preferences and interests;</li>
<li class="li12" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">When you view or interact with our sites, we may collect certain data, including IP Address, language setting, operating system type, page you requested, Advertising ID, user agent, and time stamp;</li>

<li class="li12" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">When you make a purchase through our sites, we or our vendors may also collect your information as set forth below under&nbsp;<span class="s3">WHAT INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES</span>;</li>

</ul>
<p class="p4"><b>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</b></p>
<p class="p8">Some of the User Information is collected on the sites through the use of Cookies and/or Web Beacons.&nbsp;<b>“Cookies”</b>&nbsp;are small data file identifiers that are transferred to your computer or mobile web browser that allow us, and third parties with whom we partner, to recognize your browser or mobile device and transfer information about you and your use of our sites. For example, Cookies that we use tell us how many times you have visited one of our sites, your search preferences, and if you have clicked on an advertisement that has been displayed to you. We use “persistent” Cookies to save your login information for future logins to our sites. We also use “session ID” Cookies to enable certain features of the sites, to better understand how you interact with the sites and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the sites. Unlike persistent Cookies, session ID Cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from a site and close your browser.</p>
<p class="p8">We (and third parties with whom we partner) may also deliver a file known as a web beacon, pixel or pixel tag (i.e.,&nbsp;<b>“Web Beacons”</b>) to you through our sites. Web Beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the site interface or in emails relating to the site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the site interface, such as to count visits, access Cookies, understand usage effectiveness and to determine if an email has been opened and acted upon.&nbsp;<b>“Pixels”</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>“Pixel Tags”</b>&nbsp;also known as clear GIFs, beacons, spotlight, tags or web bugs, are a method for passing information from the user’s computer to a third party website. We (and third parties with whom we partner) may deliver Web Beacons or Pixel Tags to you through our sites. Web Beacons allow ad networks, marketing partners and other service providers that we use to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us, for advertisers and our other partners. Web Beacons also enable ad networks and other partners to track your behavior for their own analysis and use, and to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites or platforms. These Web Beacons enable third party companies to view, edit, or set their own Cookies when you visit the site, just as if you had visited a web page from their site.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>WHAT INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES</b></p>
<p class="p12">Certain third party vendors and partners authorized by BRAINJOLT (including, but not limited to, advertisers, advertising agencies, ad networks, ad measurement providers, and other marketing and advertising service providers and partners) (<span class="s4">“Advertisers”</span>) may collect information about you in order to provide you with relevant advertising on the sites and on platforms and media channels, and to analyze the performance of advertising campaigns. These Advertisers may use tracking technologies such as Cookies, Web Beacons, and other similar technologies, and may collect many different kinds of data, such as your IP Address, Device ID, Advertising ID and Precise Location Data where made available by your mobile device. The specific Advertisers we work with are subject to change at any time. For a list of some of the applicable providers or for more details on opting out of tracking for advertising purposes, go to our Cookie Consent Tool by clicking on the button in the lower right corner of your screen labeled&nbsp;<span class="s4">“Cookie Consent”</span>.&nbsp;<span class="s4">The use of tracking technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies.</span></p>
<p class="p8">We may also sell or transfer Interaction Data to certain Advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests. Some of these third parties may combine the Interaction Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture. We may also share your information with Advertisers for the purpose of allowing them or their clients to send you marketing communications related to your use of the site, their services or programs featured and/or advertised on the site (e.g., through ads or Promotions), or their products, services and/or programs generally.</p>
<p class="p8">Our third party vendors and partners use your User Information to display ads on both the sites and on third party websites, applications, platforms and other media channels (collectively,&nbsp;“Channels”). For example, if you read content about a particular subject on the site, we may use Cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed content. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the site with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the site or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the site based on your interaction with the site and other Channels.</p>
<p class="p8">Some of our sites may use Facebook and Instagram features and tools, including Pixel Tags, which send data regarding your use of the site to Facebook and/or Instagram for the purpose of tracking your interaction with the site and with our brand on Facebook and Instagram, and to create custom audiences on the Facebook and/or Instagram platforms. Facebook and Instagram link the data collected on our sites with your account on their platforms and we and/or our Advertisers may use that data to serve you with advertisements both on and off of Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p class="p8">We may provide certain Advertisers with information regarding your interactions with our emails and newsletters or as to whether your information matches certain information held by the Advertiser and/or their customers. Those Advertisers may combine this data with information they collect for their own marketing purposes and in turn, may provide this information to their customers for their customers’ marketing purposes.</p>
<p class="p8">In order to help us sell advertising on the sites and otherwise publicize BRAINJOLT and its Owned and Operated sites, we may share aggregate statistics that describe our online audience. Those statistics are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse the sites and describe, among other things, the demographics of our visitors.</p>

We use third party vendors for a variety of services across our sites, such as email message deployment, email address validation, subscription fulfillment, research, statistical analysis, cross-device user tracking, data and website hosting, marketing, advertising, and other data and transaction processing.</p>
<p class="p8">We also engage third party service providers for the purpose of processing payments for subscriptions, to fulfill your orders for product purchases, to honor your request to be removed from promotional mailings, and to monitor, analyze and prevent fraudulent traffic or other suspicious activities on our sites or on other services.</p>
<p class="p8">In addition to receiving your User Information from us, our service providers may also:</p>
