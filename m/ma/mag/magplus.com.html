<p><strong>An overview of the information that Bonnier may collect:</strong></p>
<p>You are able to take advantage of many Bonnier products, services,  and websites without providing any information that personally  identifies you.&nbsp; We only collect personally-identifying information when  you voluntarily submit it to us.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we need personally-identifying information in order to  provide you with the products and services that you request.&nbsp; Depending  upon the product or service, we may ask you for a variety of  personally-identifying information.&nbsp; This might include, for example,  your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, gender, and birth  date.&nbsp; We may also ask for other information about you, such as your  credit card information (when you are making a purchase), interests,  income, or education level.&nbsp; We consider certain identifying information  “sensitive.”&nbsp; This includes your credit card number, income level, or  any other information that would normally be considered confidential.</p>
<p>You may choose not to provide us with any personally-identifying  information.&nbsp; In that case, you can still access and use many portions  of our websites; however, you will not be able to access and use those  portions of any Bonnier website that require your personal information.</p>
<p>Many Bonnier websites include community features, such as online  forums and message boards.&nbsp; Information that is posted in these areas  becomes public information and the use that any third party makes of  this information is beyond our ability to control.&nbsp; You should exercise  caution before disclosing any personally-identifying information in  these public venues. If you elect to submit content that includes  information that can be used to identify you, you must assume that the  content can and will be displayed on any website on the Internet.</p>
<p>At some Bonnier sites and through certain promotions, you can submit  personally-identifying information about other people.&nbsp; For example, you  might submit a person’s name and e-mail address to send an electronic  greeting card; or, if you order a gift online or offline and want it  sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient’s name  and address.&nbsp; Some Bonnier websites also provide referral services to  help you inform a friend about our websites, products, or services.&nbsp; The  types of personally-identifying information that we collect about other  people at pages like these may include the person’s name, address,  e-mail address, or telephone number.&nbsp; We will only ask you for the  information about your friend that we need in order to do what you  request.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we also collect non-personally-identifying  information.&nbsp; When you visit a Bonnier website, we may collect  information such as the type of browser you use, your operating system,  your IP address, and the domain name of your Internet Service Provider.&nbsp;  This information, by itself, does not permit individual identification,  meaning that you will remain anonymous.&nbsp; However, if you elect to  provide us with personally-identifying information during your visit,  that information may be linked to your IP address.</p>
<p>When you visit our websites, we may send one or more cookies—small,  removable data files—to your computer.&nbsp; We use cookies to uniquely  identify your browser, which allows us to enhance and personalize your  online experience at Bonnier websites.&nbsp; For example, cookies allow us to  recognize you when you return to a website and present relevant content  to you when you visit. Most browsers are initially set up to accept  cookies, but you can configure your browser to warn you when cookies are  sent, or to refuse all cookies. Some of the features and services of  Bonnier websites may not operate properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
<p>Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us with any  personally-identifying information.&nbsp; However, if you elect to provide us  with personally-identifying information during your visit, that  information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.</p>
<p>On our websites, we may also use tiny graphic images called pixel  tags, web beacons, or clear gifs.&nbsp; These tiny images help us to analyze  our users’ online behavior and collect other data, such as page views or  advertising responses.&nbsp; Pixel tags also allow us to send you e-mail in a  format that you can read, and let us know when you have opened an  e-mail message from us. Pixel tags may also be used to deliver cookies.</p>
<p>We work with reputable third parties that provide data tracking and collection technologies in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present or serve the advertisements you may see at Bonnier websites;</li>
<li>Deliver and track e-mail communications;</li>
<li>Process purchase orders through e-commerce transactions;</li>
<li>Fulfill print and digital subscription orders; and</li>
<li>Provide marketing leads to third-party organizations (where you have agreed to allow us to do so).</li>
</ul>
<p>These companies may collect information about you on our behalf.&nbsp; We  require that these parties agree to process any such information based  on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any  other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p>Bonnier websites sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or  promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third  parties.&nbsp; By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain  personally-identifying information that visitors voluntarily submit to  them in order to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion.&nbsp;  Bonnier has no control over the third-party sponsors’ use of this  information.&nbsp; If a third-party sponsor beyond our control will obtain  information that you supply us, we will notify you at the time we  collect the information from you.&nbsp; For certain promotions, only those  who provide us with the requested personally-identifying information  will be able to order products, programs, and services, or otherwise  participate in the promotion’s activities and offerings.</p>
<p>Some of our websites contain links to other sites.&nbsp; By clicking on  these links, you will leave the website operated by Bonnier and this  Privacy Policy will no longer apply.&nbsp; These other sites’ information  practices may be different than ours.&nbsp; You should consult the other  sites’ privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is  submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
<p><strong>How we use the information we collect:</strong></p>
<p>We use the personally-identifying information that you provide us to  fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to  respond to your inquiries about offerings, and to offer you other  products, programs, or services that we believe may be of interest to  you.&nbsp; We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as  to notify you when you have won one of our contests, when we make  changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an  online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.</p>
<p>We may syndicate the publicly available content of our community  areas to unaffiliated third-party websites, using RSS or other  technologies.</p>
<p>We will use the personally-identifying information that you provide  about others only as necessary to provide the products or services that  you have requested; for example, to enable us to send them your gifts or  cards.&nbsp; If you provide us someone else’s personally-identifying  information for referral purposes, we may use that information to invite  them to visit our websites or to provide them information about our  products or services.</p>
<p>If you provide us with your e-mail and/or postal address, we may  include that address in e-mail and/or postal address lists that we sell,  trade, or rent to third parties.&nbsp; Before sharing your e-mail or postal  address with companies not owned by Bonnier who want to market products  or services to you, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out.&nbsp;  You may also opt out of the receipt of any marketing materials from  Bonnier as detailed below.</p>
<p>We may transfer your sensitive personally-identifying information to  other Bonnier offices for internal management and administrative  purposes.&nbsp; In addition, your personal data will be transferred to other  Bonnier offices where necessary for the performance or conclusion of our  contractual obligations to you or for your benefit.&nbsp; Transfers of  personally-identifying information may also be made where necessary for  the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p>Bonnier will only share your sensitive personal information with  outside companies or individuals in any of the following limited  circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we use trusted businesses or persons to process personal  information on our behalf.&nbsp; Before sharing any personal information with  outside parties, we require that these parties agree to process such  information based on our instructions and in compliance with this  Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security  measures.</li>
<li>When we have a good faith belief that access, use,  preservation, or disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with applicable  law, regulation, or legal process; (b) enforce the applicable Terms of  Service or other agreements and policies on the Company’s Websites; (c)  detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical  issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or  safety or Bonnier, its users, or the public as required or permitted by  law.</li>
<li>When you consent.&nbsp; Before we share your sensitive personal  information outside of the previously listed circumstances, we will ask  you for permission first.&nbsp; Please note that this only applies to  sensitive information, as defined above.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data  about our users for any legal purpose, such as analyzing usage trends  and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.&nbsp; In no event will this  aggregated data contain any information that could be used to identify  individual users of our products or services.</p>
<p><strong>How we protect the safety and integrity of the information we collect:</strong></p>
<p>We take appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural measures to  safeguard and protect your personal information.&nbsp; We use a variety of  security measures, including encryption and authentication, to maintain  the confidentiality of your personal information.&nbsp; We store your  personal information on systems behind firewalls that are only  accessible to a limited number of persons, each of whom is required to  keep the information confidential.&nbsp; We also take appropriate measures to  secure the transmission of sensitive personal information from your  computer to the Company’s computers.&nbsp; When you transmit sensitive  personal information to us, like credit card information, we offer the  use of a secure connection to our servers.&nbsp; To the extent you select the  secure connection method or your browser supports such functionality,  all credit card account information that you supply is transmitted via  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Regardless of these measures, no  system connected to the Internet or data transmission sent over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; We will provide notice if  we become aware of any security breach that may affect any sensitive  personal information pertaining to you that we have stored on our  systems.</p>
<p>Bonnier employees, agents, and contractors who have access to  personally-identifying information are required to protect this  information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and  may not use the information for any purpose other than to carry out the  services they are performing for Bonnier.&nbsp; These individuals are bound  by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline,  including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet  these obligations.</p>
<p>Bonnier only collects personal information that is relevant to the  purposes for which it will be used.&nbsp; Though we do take appropriate steps  to review and update the information that we store to ensure that it is  accurate, complete, and current, we also depend on you to update or  correct your personal information when necessary.</p>
<p>You may correct or delete any or all of the personal information you  have provided to us at any time.&nbsp; Many of our websites provide means to  review and update the personal information that you have provided on  that website.&nbsp; To inquire about personally identifiable information that  Bonnier has collected about you, or about other ways to correct factual  errors in that information, please <a href="mailto:privacy@bonniercorp.com" target="_blank">e-mail us</a>. To protect your privacy  and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity  before granting access or making corrections.&nbsp; We will decline to  process requests where we cannot verify the identity of the requester.&nbsp;  We may also decline to process requests that are automated, repetitive,  systematic, or impractical, or that might jeopardize the privacy of  others.</p>
<p>In some limited circumstances, such as to resolve disputes,  troubleshoot problems, and enforce our policies, we may retain some of  information that you have requested us to remove.&nbsp; Therefore, you should  not expect that all of your personal information will be completely  removed from our databases in response to your requests.</p>
<p>We only use the information we collect for purposes consistent with  this policy.&nbsp; If we propose to use your personal information for  purposes beyond that explained in this policy, we will provide  appropriate notice before doing so and we will provide you with the  means to opt out of those uses. We will not use your sensitive personal  information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy  unless we have obtained your consent.</p>
