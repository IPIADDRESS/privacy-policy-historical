All Privacy Policy changes or modifications will be posted on the Site and shall take effect immediately upon their posting. MagazineDiscountCenter.com does not provide any other notice of such changes or modifications. Your continued access and/or use of the Site following the posting of any such changes or modifications to this Privacy Policy will constitute an affirmative acknowledgement and acceptance of the applicable changes or modifications. Please check back frequently for changes or modifications as it is your sole responsibility to be aware of any such changes.</p><span class="mb0">Information Collection</span> <strong>The Basics</strong><p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") from the Site when you request to be contacted by us, sign up for the Newsletter, attempt to contact us, provide any PII to us by or through various Online Media or otherwise voluntarily choose to provide PII to us. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, PII means any information that can be used to identify, locate or contact a particular person or entity. In particular, this includes, but shall not limited to: (a) name; (b) postal address; (c) telephone number; (d) email address; (e) credit/debit card information; (f) browser information and IP address; and/or (g) any other PII submitted voluntarily to us. For example, you may choose to provide us with PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online form on our Site.</p><p>Please note that upon voluntarily providing your consent, we may use your PII to send you the Newsletter which contains information regarding MagazineDiscountCenter.com and various products and services that may be of interest to you. Additionally, your PII may also be used to reach you, when necessary, regarding issues concerning your use of the Site and/or the Newsletter. Once collected, we will store your PII for a commercially reasonable period of time for record keeping purposes. The information that we store is sometimes deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business. Finally, please be advised that while all PII that you submit is at your discretion and completely voluntary, it may be required for valid registration on the Site.</p><strong>Use of PII</strong><p>By submitting your PII to us or to any third parties acting on our behalf, you agree to allow us to share, sell, rent, lease or otherwise provide such information to any other Internet properties or brands that we own or may later acquire and/or to any Third Parties as permitted by applicable law. You further agree that we may work with other businesses to bring selected commercial opportunities to you. These businesses and Third Parties may include, but are not limited to: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; (c) telemarketers (where permitted by applicable law); and (d) SMS text-based marketers (where, and to the extent, permitted by applicable law).</p><p>We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from our database, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to your PII as needed to perform their functions for us, but we do not permit them to use your PII for any other purposes.</p><p>We will also use your PII for customer service functions, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience with the Website and/or other Online Media and/or to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you through the Website and/or other Online Media, if any. We may also use your PII for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business. We may also combine the PII we have gathered about you with information from other sources. We may use third parties to help us operate our business, the Website and the Online Media.</p><p>We reserve the right to release current or past PII in the event that: (a) we believe that a user is using, or has used, our products, services and/or our Online Media in violation of this Privacy Policy or any other of our operating rules, policies, price schedules and other supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be published by us from time to time; (b) we believe that a user is using, or has used, our products, services and/or our Online Media to commit unlawful acts; (c) such information is subpoenaed or requested pursuant to a judicial or regulatory proceeding or inquiry; (d) we are sold or acquired; and/or (e) we deem it necessary or appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended ("CAN-SPAM") from time to time, and Federal Trade Commission implementing regulations.</p><p>By submitting your e-mail address to us by and through our Online Media or otherwise, you agree to receive e-mail marketing from us (including other MagazineDiscountCenter.com-owned properties) and our third-party advertisers. In addition, by submitting your PII by and/or through our Online Media, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR 310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the "Rule") and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and applicable state do-not-call regulations.</p><p>By submitting your PII by and/or through our Online Media, you agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to, text-message based marketing, from us and our third party advertisers and marketers (where, and to the extent that, such marketing is permitted by applicable law). As such, notwithstanding that your mobile telephone number may be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right to contact you via text-message based marketing in accordance with applicable state and federal law. Further, you agree that we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute your mobile telephone and other mobile data with/to any third-party for any and all non-marketing uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p><p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute any and all PII with/to any third party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p><strong>Special Offers and Promotions</strong><p>We may also send you communications with special offers and promotions. If you don't want to receive these, you may change your preferences by contacting us via e-mail at: <a href="mailto:pr@MagazineDiscountCenter.com">pr@MagazineDiscountCenter.com</a> or calling customer service at 1-800-321-MAGS (6247).</p><p>Please be advised that if you are a resident of the State of California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your PII to any third party for marketing purposes, please e-mail us at: <a href="mailto:pr@MagazineDiscountCenter.com">pr@MagazineDiscountCenter.com</a>. Please be advised that where California residents opt-out from permitting their PII to be shared, such individuals may still receive selected offers directly from us, in accordance with the law.</p><span>Third Party Cookies</span><p>When you visit the Website and/or other Online Media, we, or a data provider we have engaged, may place, recognize or send a unique cookie, single-pixel GIF files/images and/or similar technologies (collectively, "Cookie") to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to your Internet browser.
