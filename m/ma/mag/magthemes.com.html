          <br><h3>Privacy Policy: The Boring Details</h3>
          <p>By using Recapture.io (the “Website”) and/or a Recapture account (the “Service”), you agree to the terms of this Privacy
            Policy and the Terms of Service. Recapture is designed and operated by Skyline Consulting Co d/b/a Recapture.io (“Recapture”). 
            Please read the <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>  in their entirety, and refer to those for definitions and contacts.</p>
          <br><h4 id="data_collected">Data Collected</h4>
          <p>We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information
            like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser
            language, and a timestamp for the request.</p>
          <p>For the Service, we ask you to register an account, log in and provide certain information (such as names and email addresses
            of your team members, your company name and address and your credit card information) in order to be able to store your
            cart data and emails, as well as periodically automatically bill you &amp; charge your card (credit card numbers
            are never stored on Recapture servers, but are securely transmitted and stored with our payment provider).</p>
          <p>We use cookies to store session information for your convenience. Cookies must be enabled to use the Website and the Service.</p>
          <p>In order to take advantage of certain features of the Service, you may also choose to provide us with other personal information,
            such as your picture, but your decision to utilize these features and provide such data will always be voluntary.</p>
          <br><h4 id="use_of_data">Use of the Data</h4>
          <p>We only use your personal information to provide you with the Service to communicate with you about the Service or the Website.</p>
          <p>With respect to any data you may choose to enter or upload to Recapture, we take the privacy and confidentiality of this data
            seriously. Your data (in the Service) is specifically not shared between accounts or with the public. We employ industry
            standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data that we store, including personal information. All off-site
            backups of your data are securely encrypted.</p>
          <p>Please note that if you choose to share data (like sharing invoices with your clients), we are not responsible for any violation
            of privacy law you may be liable for.</p>
          <p>We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, unless:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>doing so is appropriate to carry out a user’s request;</li>
            <li>we believe it’s necessary in order to provide the highest quality of service;</li>
            <li>we believe it’s needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;</li>
            <li>we believe it’s needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;</li>
            <li>otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.</li>
          </ul>

We needed to send abandoned cart emails that <a href="/img/home/hdu_abcart.png" target="_blank"></a>didn't suck, and we didn't want to use a self-hosted solution and gum up our Magento installation.

          <p class="feature-text">
            We couldn't find a well-built, cost-effective service out there, so we built it ourselves. It works so incredibly well for us that we decided to share it with anyone who wants it.
