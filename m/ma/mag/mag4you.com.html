<br>
We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have 
adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal 
information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use 
your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy 
Policy. The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages, 
newsletters, discussion lists and opt-in announcement lists managed and/or owned 
and/or operated by <b><a href="http://www.mag4you.com/"><font color="#FFFFFF">

<font face="Arial" size="4"><b><font size="2">What information are you 
collecting and how are you collecting it? </font></b><font size="2"><br>
<br>
Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of 
numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a 
visitor requests a page from any Web site within the web sites owned and/or 
managed by Mag4you.com Online Magazine., our Web servers automatically recognize 
that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal 
nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have 
accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, 
but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our Web 
servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors. <br>
<br>
<b>What are cookies? </b><br>
<br>
A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server 
and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your system. We 
use cookies to identify which areas of our web sites you have visited or 
customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. 
We may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an 
advertisement. Our advertisers/clients and/or we may use this information to 
better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our 
Site/s. <br>
<br>
You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your 
browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser 
to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these 
cookies, your experience at our site and other Web sites may be diminished and 
some features may not work as intended. <br>
<br>
<b>What other information do you request?</b><br>
<br>
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of 
conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, 
subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information about 
seminars, etc.). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly 
indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We 
maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, 
rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your 
consent. <br>
<br>
If you sign up for a forum or service, your name or alias is recorded solely for 
purposes of maintaining your own account within the forums/service. This 
information is not used to monitor your activity within a forum/service, nor is 
it used to identify you outside the network in any way. <br>
<br>
When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, 
and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. <br>
