     How Information Is Collected.
     </h4>
     </strong>
     <p>MLF might collect personal and non-personal information from you when you visit, access or use the Site and/or the App; when you register with the Site and/or the App; when you register for the products and/or services of MLF online through the Site and/or the App; when you "sign in," "log in," or the like to the Site and/or the App; when you allow the Site and/or the App to access, upload, download, import or export content found on or through, or to otherwise interact with, your computer or mobile device (or any other device you may use to visit, access or use the Site and/or the App) or online accounts with third-party websites, networks, platforms, servers or applications (e.g., your online social media accounts, your cloud drives and servers, your mobile device service provider); or whenever MLF asks you for such information, such as, for example, when you process a payment through the Site and/or the App, or when you answer an online survey or questionnaire.</p>
     <p> In addition, if you or a third party sends MLF a comment, message or other communication (such as, by way of example only, email, letter, fax, phone call, or voice message) about you, your activities on or through the Site and/or the App, then MLF may collect any personal or non-personal information provided therein or therewith.</p>
     <p> Finally, MLF may use various tracking, data aggregation and/or data analysis technologies, including, for example, the following:</p>
     <ul style="font-family:'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;list-style-type:disc;font-size:0.8em;">
         <li>Cookies, which are small data files (e.g., text files) stored on the browser or device you use to view a website or message. They may help store user preferences and activity, and may allow a website to recognize a particular browser or device. There are several types of cookies, including, for example, browser cookies, session cookies, and persistent cookies. Cookies may record information you access on one page of a website to simplify subsequent interaction with that website, or to help streamline your transactions on related pages of that website. Most major browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you might be able to adjust your browser's or device's preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to block, reject, disable, delete or manage the use of some or all cookies on your browser or device.</li>
         <li>Flash cookies, which are cookies written using Adobe Flash, and which may be permanently stored on your device. Like regular cookies, Flash cookies may help store user preferences and activity, and may allow a website to recognize a particular browser or device. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings that are used for regular cookies.</li>
         <li>Web beacons, which are pieces of code embedded in a website or email to monitor your activity on the website or your opening of the email, and which can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer or device you use to view the website or open the email, the URL page on which the web beacon is located, the type of browser that was used to access the website, and previously set cookie values. Web beacons are sometimes used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. Disabling your computer's, device's or browser's cookies may prevent some web beacons from tracking or recording certain information about your activities.</li>
         <li>Scripts, which are pieces of code embedded in a website to define how the website behaves in response to certain key or click requests sent by the user. Scripts are sometimes used to collect information about the user's interactions with the website, such as the links the user clicks on. Scripts are often times temporarily downloaded to the user's computer or device from the website server, active only while the user is connected to the Site and/or the App, and deactivated or deleted when the user disconnects from the website.</li>
         <li>Analytic tools and services, which are sometimes offered by third parties, and which track, measure and/or generate information about a website's or program's traffic, sales, audience and similar information, and which may be used for various reasons, such as, for example, statistical research, marketing research, and content ratings research, and conversion tracking. Examples of analytic tools and services which MLF may use include Google Analytics, Google DoubleClick for Publishers (f/k/a Google Dart), Nielsen Digital Content Ratings (DCR) Analytics, and Alkamai Media Analytics. MLF may also use other third-party analytic tools and services.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Please be advised that if you choose to block, reject, disable, delete or change the management settings for any or all of the aforementioned technologies and/or other tracking, data aggregation and data analysis technologies, then certain areas of the Site and/or the App might not function properly. </p>
     <p> By visiting, accessing or using the Site and/or the App, you acknowledge and agree in each instance that you are giving MLF permission to monitor or otherwise track your activities on the Site and/or the App, and that MLF may use the aforementioned technologies and/or other tracking, data aggregation and data analysis technologies.</p>
     <p> Additional information about how MLF uses cookies and similar technologies and how you can change your settings are set forth in MLF's <u><strong><a href="/contentpage?content-id=8376">Cookie Policy</a></strong></u><strong>.</strong></p>
