Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Mazda Australia Pty Ltd (“<strong>Mazda</strong>”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals. &nbsp;Mazda is bound by the Privacy Principles set out in the<em>&nbsp;Privacy</em>&nbsp;<em>Act 1988</em>&nbsp;(Commonwealth) (the&nbsp;<strong>Act</strong>).</p>
<p>Mazda will only collect, use or disclose personal information in accordance with the Act and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Mazda may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. &nbsp;The updated version will be available by following the “Privacy Policy” link on Mazda’s website homepage, at&nbsp;<a class="external-link" title="Mazda Australia Website" href="/" rel="nofollow">www.mazda.com.au</a>. &nbsp;Mazda may highlight changes to this Privacy Policy on its homepage, but you should check the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” has the meaning set out in the Act.&nbsp; Essentially, personal information is information or an opinion about an individual who is reasonably identifiable.&nbsp; It includes, for example, your name together with your contact details.</p>
<p>Mazda dealers are independent of Mazda and may have privacy policies which differ from ours.&nbsp; Mazda dealers are responsible for their own privacy policies and privacy practices.&nbsp; Please contact your Mazda dealer directly for further information. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. When do we collect personal information?</strong></p>
<p>Mazda collects personal information in a number of ways. The most common ways are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>We may collect your personal information directly from you, when you provide it to us or to our agents or contractors including when you:
<ul>
<li>request a brochure, join a mailing list or request information including from the Mazda website or at a motor show, Mazda Drive Day or other promotional day such as MDay;</li>
<li>enter a competition or respond to a survey;</li>
<li>apply for a job at Mazda; or</li>
<li>conduct business with us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We may collect your personal information via a Mazda dealer when you:
<ul>
<li>take a test drive at a Mazda dealer;</li>
<li>purchase a new or used Mazda vehicle or Mazda parts from a Mazda dealer;</li>
<li>arrange finance for the purchase of a Mazda vehicle; or</li>
<li>have a vehicle serviced or repaired at a Mazda dealer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br>We may also collect personal information about you from publicly available sources, from our related companies or from third parties (for example, from referees if you apply for a job with us).</p>
<p><strong>3. What personal information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>The types of personal information we collect from you will depend on the circumstances in which the information is collected.</p>
<p>Mazda may collect contact details including your name, address, email address and phone and fax numbers. &nbsp;Where relevant, we may also collect your driver’s licence details, date of birth, gender, information about your vehicle (including its number plate and vehicle identification number), answers you provide to questions we ask and other information in relation to your dealings with Mazda or Mazda dealers (such as types of vehicle purchased and replaced).</p>
<p>In some cases Mazda may also collect demographic information such as your age, occupation and approximate income. &nbsp;This information is sought to assist us to better understand and service our customers. &nbsp;This information is de-identified when input into our analysis projects or research tools and then only used as aggregated demographic data.</p>
<p>Mazda does not require customers to provide any sensitive information. &nbsp;If you do provide sensitive information to us for any reason (for example, if you provide us with information about a disability you have or other health related information), you consent to us collecting that information and to us using and disclosing that information for the purpose for which you disclosed it to us and as permitted by the Act.&nbsp; In the case of business related purchases, sensitive information in relation to an individual’s membership of a trade or similar association may be provided to us but we do not actively seek this information and will not keep a record of it unless we need to for our business purposes.</p>
<p><strong>4. What do we use personal information for?</strong></p>
<p>The purposes for which we use your personal information will depend on the circumstances in which we collected it.</p>
<p>For example, we may use your personal information so that:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can do business together;</li>
<li>we can consider you for employment or other relationships; or</li>
<li>you can use our website.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>We may use or disclose your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the purposes for which we collected it (and related purposes which would be reasonably expected by you);</li>
<li>for other purposes to which you have consented; and</li>
<li>as otherwise authorised or required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Generally, we will only use and disclose the personal information that we collect about you for purposes connected with our business operations.&nbsp; These purposes may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>verifying your identity;</li>
<li>contacting you (including via electronic messaging such as SMS and email, by mail, by phone or in any other lawful manner);</li>
<li>assessing your suitability for employment or other relationships with us;</li>
<li>providing goods or services to you or receiving goods or services from you;</li>
<li>addressing any issues or complaints that we or you have regarding our relationship; and</li>
<li>developing and improving our business.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>For example, when you purchase a vehicle from a Mazda dealer, we may use the information you provide (via the dealer) to contact you with a reminder when the vehicle is due for a service.</p>
<p>We may also use your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>to contact you with further information about, and to seek feedback on, our products and services and the products and services of Mazda dealers and our third party marketing partners;</li>
<li>to improve our products and services;</li>
<li>to understand our customer base; and&nbsp;to evaluate Mazda dealers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. To whom do we disclose personal information?</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with the purposes described in section 4 of this policy.</p>
<p>This may include disclosing your personal information to the following types of third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mazda dealers;</li>
<li>any third parties to whom you have directed us to disclose your personal information (e.g. referees);</li>
<li>our related companies;</li>
<li>our contractors (such as mailing houses, marketing agencies, insurance providers, website and data hosting providers and other IT suppliers) and others persons who perform services for us;</li>
<li>companies who may use your personal information in order to tailor electronic advertising to you (e.g. on a webpage) in relation to our products and services;</li>
<li>our accountants, insurers, lawyers, auditors and other professional advisers;</li>
<li>in the unlikely event that we or our assets may be acquired or considered for acquisition by a third party, that third party and its advisors;</li>
<li>third parties that require the information for law enforcement or to prevent a serious threat to public safety; and</li>
<li>otherwise as permitted or required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Where we disclose your personal information to third parties we will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that such third parties protect your personal information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Some information that you post to parts of our website or to our social media pages may be available to be viewed by the public.&nbsp; You should use discretion is deciding what information you upload to such sites.</p>

Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Mazda Australia Pty Ltd (“<strong>Mazda</strong>”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals. &nbsp;Mazda is bound by the Privacy Principles set out in the<em>&nbsp;Privacy</em>&nbsp;<em>Act 1988</em>&nbsp;(Commonwealth) (the&nbsp;<strong>Act</strong>).</p>\n<p>Mazda will only collect, use or disclose personal information in accordance with the Act and this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Mazda may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. &nbsp;The updated version will be available by following the “Privacy Policy” link on Mazda’s website homepage, at&nbsp;<a class=\"external-link\" title=\"Mazda Australia Website\" href=\"/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mazda.com.au</a>. &nbsp;Mazda may highlight changes to this Privacy Policy on its homepage, but you should check the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.</p>\n<p>In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” has the meaning set out in the Act.&nbsp; Essentially, personal information is information or an opinion about an individual who is reasonably identifiable.&nbsp; It includes, for example, your name together with your contact details.</p>\n<p>Mazda dealers are independent of Mazda and may have privacy policies which differ from ours.&nbsp; Mazda dealers are responsible for their own privacy policies and privacy practices.&nbsp; Please contact your Mazda dealer directly for further information. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. When do we collect personal information?</strong></p>\n<p>Mazda collects personal information in a number of ways. The most common ways are described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect your personal information directly from you, when you provide it to us or to our agents or contractors including when you:\n<ul>\n<li>request a brochure, join a mailing list or request information including from the Mazda website or at a motor show, Mazda Drive Day or other promotional day such as MDay;</li>\n<li>enter a competition or respond to a survey;</li>\n<li>apply for a job at Mazda; or</li>\n<li>conduct business with us.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect your personal information via a Mazda dealer when you:\n<ul>\n<li>take a test drive at a Mazda dealer;</li>\n<li>purchase a new or used Mazda vehicle or Mazda parts from a Mazda dealer;</li>\n<li>arrange finance for the purchase of a Mazda vehicle; or</li>\n<li>have a vehicle serviced or repaired at a Mazda dealer</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />We may also collect personal information about you from publicly available sources, from our related companies or from third parties (for example, from referees if you apply for a job with us).</p>\n<p><strong>3. What personal information do we collect?</strong></p>\n<p>The types of personal information we collect from you will depend on the circumstances in which the information is collected.</p>\n<p>Mazda may collect contact details including your name, address, email address and phone and fax numbers. &nbsp;Where relevant, we may also collect your driver’s licence details, date of birth, gender, information about your vehicle (including its number plate and vehicle identification number), answers you provide to questions we ask and other information in relation to your dealings with Mazda or Mazda dealers (such as types of vehicle purchased and replaced).</p>\n<p>In some cases Mazda may also collect demographic information such as your age, occupation and approximate income. &nbsp;This information is sought to assist us to better understand and service our customers. &nbsp;This information is de-identified when input into our analysis projects or research tools and then only used as aggregated demographic data.</p>\n<p>Mazda does not require customers to provide any sensitive information. &nbsp;If you do provide sensitive information to us for any reason (for example, if you provide us with information about a disability you have or other health related information), you consent to us collecting that information and to us using and disclosing that information for the purpose for which you disclosed it to us and as permitted by the Act.&nbsp; In the case of business related purchases, sensitive information in relation to an individual’s membership of a trade or similar association may be provided to us but we do not actively seek this information and will not keep a record of it unless we need to for our business purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What do we use personal information for?</strong></p>\n<p>The purposes for which we use your personal information will depend on the circumstances in which we collected it.</p>\n<p>For example, we may use your personal information so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we can do business together;</li>\n<li>we can consider you for employment or other relationships; or</li>\n<li>you can use our website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />We may use or disclose your personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for the purposes for which we collected it (and related purposes which would be reasonably expected by you);</li>\n<li>for other purposes to which you have consented; and</li>\n<li>as otherwise authorised or required by law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />Generally, we will only use and disclose the personal information that we collect about you for purposes connected with our business operations.&nbsp; These purposes may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>verifying your identity;</li>\n<li>contacting you (including via electronic messaging such as SMS and email, by mail, by phone or in any other lawful manner);</li>\n<li>assessing your suitability for employment or other relationships with us;</li>\n<li>providing goods or services to you or receiving goods or services from you;</li>\n<li>addressing any issues or complaints that we or you have regarding our relationship; and</li>\n<li>developing and improving our business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />For example, when you purchase a vehicle from a Mazda dealer, we may use the information you provide (via the dealer) to contact you with a reminder when the vehicle is due for a service.</p>\n<p>We may also use your personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to contact you with further information about, and to seek feedback on, our products and services and the products and services of Mazda dealers and our third party marketing partners;</li>\n<li>to improve our products and services;</li>\n<li>to understand our customer base; and&nbsp;to evaluate Mazda dealers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.
