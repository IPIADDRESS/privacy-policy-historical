<p><strong>Website  Visitors</strong><br> Like most website operators, Mawindo  collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers  and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language  preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Mawindo’s  purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better  understand how Mawindo’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Mawindo may  release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by  publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<br> Mawindo also collects potentially  personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Mawindo  does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not  disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses  and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
<p><br> <strong>Gathering  of Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br> Certain visitors to Mawindo’s  websites choose to interact with Mawindo in ways that require Mawindo to gather  personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Mawindo  gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Mawindo does not disclose  personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors  can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat  that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<p><br> <strong>Aggregated  Statistics</strong><br> Mawindo may collect statistics about  the behavior of visitors to its websites and &nbsp;may display this information publicly or  provide it to others. However, Mawindo does not disclose personally-identifying  information other than as described below.</p>
<p><br> <strong>Protection  of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br> Mawindo discloses potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of  its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know  that information in order to process it on Mawindo’s behalf or to provide  services available at Mawindo’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to  disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated  organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Mawindo’s  websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Mawindo will  not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying  information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated  organizations, as described above, Mawindo discloses potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when  required to do so by law, or when Mawindo believes in good faith that  disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mawindo,  third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Mawindo  website and have supplied your email address, Mawindo may occasionally send you  an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep  you up to date with what’s going on with Mawindo and our products. If you send  us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback  mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or  respond to your request or to help us support other users. Mawindo takes all  measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,  alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying  information.</p>
<h3>Our Policy Towards Children</h3>
<p>The Site is not directed to persons under 18. If a parent or guardian  becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally  identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at  info at mawindo dot com. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable  information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13  has provided us with personal identifiable information, we will delete such  information from our files.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy  Policy Changes</strong><br> Although most changes are likely to  be minor, Mawindo may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Mawindo’s  sole discretion. Mawindo encourages visitors to frequently check this page for  any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any  change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
