<p>MastiShare Privacy Notice</p>
<p>MastiShare recognizes that its customers, visitors, users, and others who use 
www.MastiShare.com or other web sites owned or operated by MastiShare (the 
MastiShare Sites) (collectively or individually Users) value their privacy. This 
Privacy Notice details important information regarding the use and disclosure of 
User information collected on the MastiShare Sites. MastiShare provides this 
Privacy Notice to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or 
continue using the MastiShare Sites. This Privacy Notice is incorporated into 
and is subject to the MastiShare Terms of Use. Your use of the MastiShare Sites 
and any personal information you provide on the MastiShare Sites remains subject 
to the terms of this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use. Please note that any 
video, image, or other content posted at the direction of Users onto the 
MastiShare Sites becomes published content and is not considered personally 
identifiable information subject to this Privacy Notice. The Information 
MastiShare Collects </p>
<p>The Information MastiShare Collects</p>
<p>User Provided Information: You provide certain personally identifiable 
information (such as your name and email address) to MastiShare when choosing to 
participate in various activities on the MastiShare Sites such as uploading 
videos, posting messages in our forums or in the photo/video comments section, 
entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to 
surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists. Cookies 
Information </p>
<p>Cookies Information</p>
<p>When you visit the MastiShare Sites, we may send one or more cookies a small 
text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters to your computer that 
uniquely identifies your browser. MastiShare uses both session cookies and 
persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. 
Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. 
Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file 
directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your 
browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate 
when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the MastiShare Sites may 
not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. </p>
<p>Log File Information </p>
<p>When you use the MastiShare Sites, our servers automatically record certain 
information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These 
server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol 
(IP) address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, 
platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and 
the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date 
and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify 
your browser. </p>
<p>The Way MastiShare Uses Information</p>
<p>If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the 
MastiShare Sites, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, 
and provide to you the features and functionality of the MastiShare Sites. Any 
personal information or video/photo content that you voluntarily disclose online 
(on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile 
page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. 
Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you 
upload videos or send messages through the MastiShare Sites and other Users can 
contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the 
MastiShare Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media 
channels, and may be viewed by the general public. We do not use your email 
address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or 
marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program 
or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, 
however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or 
administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major MastiShare Site changes 
or for customer service purposes). We use both your personally identifiable 
information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as 
anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream 
data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the MastiShare Sites and to 
create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, 
tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends. We use cookies and log file 
information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter 
it during your visit or the next time you visit the MastiShare Sites; (b) 
provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the 
effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as 
total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, 
submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. </p>
<p>When MastiShare Discloses Information</p>
<p>We provide personally identifiable information and 
non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated 
companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such 
information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such 
information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts 
to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate 
confidentiality and security measures. We do not share your personally 
identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party 
companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except 
as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to 
opt-in or opt-out. We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as 
anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, 
number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in 
understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, 
promotions, and/or functionality on the MastiShare Sites. We may release 
personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable 
information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such 
action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. 
Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. 
MastiShare also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable 
information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that MastiShare 
believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of 
Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself 
against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement 
agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect 
the rights, property, or personal safety of MastiShare, our Users or others. </p>
<p>Your Choices</p>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information 
through the MastiShare Sites, in which case MastiShare may not be able to 
provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal profile 
information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile 
page. Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the MastiShare Sites 
cannot be removed and remain subject to our Terms of Use. To protect your 
privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique 
password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making 
corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique 
password and account information at all times. Please contact MastiShare with 
any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice, your personal information, 
your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices by using the contact form. </p>
<p>Third-Party Advertisers, Links to other sites</p>
<p>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites MastiShare allows other 
companies, called Webmasters, third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve 
advertisements within the MastiShare Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad 
networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements 
and links that appear on the MastiShare Sites. They automatically receive your 
IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as 
cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their 
advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. MastiShare does not 
provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers 
or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or 
feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, 
please note that if an advertiser asks MastiShare to show an advertisement to a 
certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, 
men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to 
that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the 
description of the audience they are trying to reach. You should consult the 
respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. 
MastiShare privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the 
activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. </p>
<p>Our commitment to Data Securtiy</p>
<p>MastiShare uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical 
safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. 
We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you 
transmit to MastiShare and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your 
transmission of information, MastiShare makes commercially reasonable efforts to 
ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a 
guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or 
destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 
If MastiShare learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify 
you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. MastiShare 
may post a notice on the MastiShare Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending 
on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security 
breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to 
withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify 
customer service. </p>
<p>Our commitment to Legal_Age Usage</p>
<p>Protecting children from adult ocntent is especially important. For that 
reason, MastiShare does not knowingly collect or maintain personally 
identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the 
MastiShare Sites from persons under 18 years of age, and no part of our website 
is directed to persons under 18, or legal age according to state law. If you are 
under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the MastiShare Sites at 
any time or in any manner. If MastiShare learns that personally identifiable 
information of persons under 18 years of age has been collected on the 
MastiShare Sites then MastiShare will take the appropriate steps to delete this 
information. </p>
<p>Special Note to International Users</p>
<p>The MastiShare Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for and 
directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing the 
MastiShare Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or 
regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ 
from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of 
the MastiShare Sites, which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and 
our Terms of Use, you are transferring your personal information to the United 
States and you consent to that transfer. </p>
<p>In the Event of Merger,Sale, or Bankruptcy</p>
<p>In the event that MastiShare is acquired by or merged with a third party 
entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or 
assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, 
acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our 
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the 
benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles 
affecting creditors rights generally, we may not be able to control how your 
personal information is treated, transferred, or used. </p>
<p>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and users are encouraged to 
review the Notices periodically to stay aware of any changes. In general, we 
only use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Notice 
in effect when we received the personal information you provided. Your continued 
use of the MastiShare Sites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Notice 
and any future revisions. For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be 
materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information 
you have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before 
implementing such revisions with respect to such information.</p>
