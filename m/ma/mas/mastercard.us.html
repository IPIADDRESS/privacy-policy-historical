        <p>For the purpose of this Global Privacy Notice, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. Examples of Personal Information include: name, email address, IP address, personal account number and phone number. We may obtain different types of Personal Information relating to you in the situations described below.</p>
		<p><b>Personal Information We Receive from Financial Institutions, Merchants, and Other Partners in Connection with Mastercard’s Products or Services</b></p>
		<p>As a processor of payment transactions and provider of related services, we obtain a limited amount of information in connection with your payment transactions such as the personal account number, the merchant’s name and location, the date and the total amount of transaction. Importantly, we generally do not need or collect the cardholder’s name or other contact information to process payment transactions.</p>
		<p>In addition, for certain products and services, your financial institutions, the merchants where you make a transaction or other partners may provide us with more information about you, or we may collect it directly from you to provide you with those products and services on their behalf, support their business or perform processing activities on their behalf.</p>
		<p>In the above situations, we act on behalf of and under the instructions of financial institutions, merchants and other partners which act as data controllers. Unless otherwise authorized by law, we will process your Personal Information to process payment transactions or for the purposes agreed between Mastercard and the financial institutions, merchants and other partners. Please refer to their respective privacy policy for more information regarding the processing of your Personal Information.</p>
		<p><b>Personal Information We Collect when Providing Mastercard’s Products and Services Directly to You </b></p>
		<p>Mastercard may provide you directly with products and services such as marketing programs, rewards programs, eWallets, prepaid services, location alert programs, and biometric authentication tools. To benefit from one or more of these products and services, you can submit information to us directly via various means including: (i) on our websites and digital assets, (ii) in response to marketing or other communications,  (iii) by signing up for a Mastercard product or service, or (iv) through your participation in an offer, program or promotion.  We may also obtain Personal Information about you through your use of our products or services, from companies that use or facilitate our products or services, from publicly available sources, or from third party partners. Your Personal Information may also be passed on to us by your financial institution, merchant or other business partners.</p>
		<p>Below is an overview of the types of Personal Information we may collect in relation to programs we offer directly to you. Each program differs, so where applicable, please refer to the relevant program-specific privacy notice for more information on the use of your Personal Information for that specific program.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Registration and payment information</u>: We may collect your contact information (such as name, email address, phone number, billing or shipping address), username and password, age, date of birth, gender and family status, language preferences, personal account number, merchant’s name and location, date and total amount of the transactions, card expiration date and card verification code. </li>
            <li><u>Information we process to provide you with the program</u>: We may collect different types of Personal Information depending on the program. For example, programs designed to offer you location-based services will typically require the collection of your address or location. Similarly, programs designed to allow you to authenticate for example, via facial or fingerprint recognition may require the processing of your photograph and/or biometric data. All these programs are voluntary, and your Personal Information is only collected if you subscribe to such programs.</li>
            <li><u>Other information you choose to provide</u>: You may choose to provide other information, such as different types of content (e.g., photographs, articles, comments), contact information of friends or other people you would like us to contact, content you make available through social media accounts or memberships with third parties, or any other information you want to share with us.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, we may collect or use Personal Information for fraud prevention and monitoring, risk management, dispute resolution and other related purposes. Such information may include the personal account number, merchant’s name and location, date and total amount of the transactions, IP address, fraud score, location data, merchant details, items purchased and information about the dispute.

        <p><b>Personal Information We Obtain from Your Interaction with Mastercard’s Ads, Websites, Apps or Other Digital Assets</b></p>
        <p>We, our service providers and partners may collect certain information about you via automated means such as cookies and web beacons when you interact with our ads, mobile apps, or visit our websites, pages or other digital assets. The information we collect in this manner may include: IP address, browser type, operating system, mobile device identifier, geographical area, referring URLs and information on actions taken or interaction with our digital assets. A “cookie” is a text file placed on a computer’s hard drive by a web server. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is a technology that helps us identify when content has been accessed or visited.</p>
		<p>We use this information to improve our online products and services by assessing how many users access or use our online products and services, which content, products and features of our online products and services most interest our visitors, what types of offers our customers like to see and how our online products and services perform from a technical point of view. For instance, we may use third-party web analytics services on our websites and mobile apps, such as those of Adobe Omniture. The analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies and web beacons to help us analyze how visitors use our websites and apps.</p>
		<p>We, our service providers and partners may also collect information about you in connection with our marketing activities, including offers, sweepstakes, contests and promotions. The information collected for these purposes may include your contact information (e.g., name, postal address, email address, phone number), electronic identification data (e.g., username, password, security questions, IP address), and data collected in the context of online marketing programs (e.g., personal characteristics, life habits, consumption habits, interests, location data, and voice and image recordings).</p>
		<p>We, our service providers and partners may also collect information about you to provide you with content and advertising tailored to your individual interests. The information collected for these purposes may include details about things like the particular pages or ads you view on our websites and apps and the actions you take on our websites and apps.</p>
		<p>In addition, some of our online products and services include advanced fraud prevention technology using behavioral-based data, such as keystroke timing, device accelerometer, scroll position and mouse-location.</p>
		<p>Where required under applicable law, we obtain your consent prior to using the above automated means, and prior to sending you marketing communications, tailored content and advertisings.</p>
		<p>Please see the “<a href="#rights" class="goto">Your Rights and Choices</a>” section of this Global Privacy Notice to learn about your choices.</p>
		<p>Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based do-not-track (“DNT”) mechanisms, Mastercard does not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time. To learn more about browser tracking signals and DNT, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Personal Information We Obtain when You Apply for a Job with Us</b></p>
		<p>If you are applying for a job at Mastercard, we may collect certain Personal Information from your job applications on our Career website, such as your contact information (including name, postal address, email address and phone number), job history, curriculum vitae, contact details of your referees and any other Personal Information you choose to submit along with your application.</p>
		<p><b>Personal Information We Collect in the Context of Our Business Relationship with Financial Institution, Merchant or other Entity Partnering with Mastercard</b></p>
		<p>We may collect Personal Information from individuals working for one of our business partners (including financial institutions, merchants, customers, suppliers, vendors and other partners), including name, job title, department and name of organization, business email and postal addresses, business telephone number, answers to security questions, security passwords and other credentials. We may use this information to provide products and services directly to financial institutions, corporate clients, merchants, customers and partners, to manage our business relationships and financial reporting, for franchise development and integrity, for marketing and to comply with applicable law, as well as for accounting, auditing and billing purposes.</p>

    <h3>5. Data Transfers</h3>
    <p>Mastercard is a global business. We may transfer your Personal Information to the United States and other countries which may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information, but we will protect your Personal Information in accordance with this Global Privacy Notice, or as otherwise disclosed to you. </p>
	<p>If you are located in the EEA, we will process your Personal Information in accordance with our Binding Corporate Rules and other data transfer mechanisms.</p>
	<p>Mastercard’s privacy practices, described in this Global Privacy Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System. The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found at: <a href="http://www.apec.org/Groups/Committee-on-Trade-and-Investment/~/media/Files/Groups/ECSG/CBPR/CBPR-PoliciesRulesGuidelines.ashx" target="_blank">http://www.apec.org/Groups/Committee-on-Trade-and-Investment/~/media/Files/Groups/ECSG/CBPR/CBPR-PoliciesRulesGuidelines.ashx</a></p>

        <p>Mastercard is a global business. We may transfer the Personal Information we collect about you to recipients in countries other than your country, including the United States, where we are headquartered. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your Personal Information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Global Privacy Notice, as disclosed to you at the time of data collection or as described in our program-specific privacy notice.</p>
        <p>We comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate safeguards for the transfer of Personal Information to countries other than the country where you are located. In particular, we have established and implemented a set of Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) that have been recognized by EEA data protection authorities as providing an adequate level of protection to the Personal Information we process globally. A copy of our BCRs is available <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/mccom/global/documents/mastercard-bcrs-february-2017.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. We may also transfer Personal Information to countries for which adequacy decisions have been issued, use contractual protections for the transfer of Personal Information to third parties, such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent under applicable law, or rely on third parties’ certification to the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks where applicable. You may contact us as specified in the “<a href="#contactUs" class="goto">How to Contact Us</a>” section below to obtain a copy of the safeguards we use to transfer Personal Information outside of the EEA.</p>

        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to Mastercard. We are committed to protecting the information we collect. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Information you provide or we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We use SSL encryption on a number of our websites from which we transfer certain Personal Information.</p>
		<p>We also take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrolment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.</p>
