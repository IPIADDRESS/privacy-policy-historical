• MML Investors Services<br>
• MML Bay State Life Insurance Company</p><p>

</p><p>At MassMutual (“we”, “us”, or “our”) we are committed to maintaining your confidence and trust as it relates to the privacy of your information.  Please read below and learn how we collect, protect, share and use your information as part of our technology platforms, including, without limitation, our websites, interactive features, applications, and social network pages (“Platforms”).</p>

<br>
<p><b>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON OUR PLATFORMS</b></p>

<p>Information You Provide To Us</p>

<p>We may collect Personal Information (information that can be used to identify you as an individual) such as your name, email, telephone number, home address, demographic information (such as zip code, age), payment information (such as account or credit card number), social security number, medical and health information, checking history, account balances.  The types of Personal Information we collect may vary depending on your use of the features of the Platforms.  If you are a customer of MassMutual and use the Platforms to access account, contract or policy information, we will handle your information in accordance with our customer privacy notice which you may <a href="/mmfg/pdf/Privacy_Notice.pdf" target="_blank">access here</a>.</p>

<p>Information We Collect Automatically</p>

<p><i>Usage Information.</i> Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, we, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Platforms are accessed and used (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the Platforms. This information helps us keep our Platforms fresh and interesting to our visitors and allows us to tailor content to a visitor’s interests.</p>

<p><i>Device Identifier.</i> We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the Device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access the Platforms. A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Platforms, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify you and your interests, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

<p><i>Cookies; Pixel Tags.</i> The technologies used on the Platforms to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platforms), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed).  Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Platforms and your activities on such social networking sites.  We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation, to perform analytics, and personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location, or demographic information).  A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.</p>

<p>To learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us, or delete cookies that have already been installed in your browser’s cookie folder, or prevent tracking activities, please refer to your browser’s tools or help menu or other instructions related to your browser. Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol has not yet been established, our information collection practices on our Platforms will continue to operate as described in this online privacy notice regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent by certain browsers. However, you may refuse to accept cookies in order to prevent tracking activities. If you do disable or opt out of receiving cookies, please be aware that some features and services on our Platforms may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.</p>

<br>
<p><b>2. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p>

<p>We use the information we collect about and from you for a variety of business purposes such as to respond to your questions and requests for services; provide you with access to certain areas and features of the Platforms such as certain products and services; purchase history; verify your identity; communicate with you about your account and activities on the Platforms and, in our discretion, changes to any of our policies; tailor content, advertisements, and offers we serve you; improve the Platforms; comply with license obligations; and for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information or otherwise with your consent. We may also collect your location based information for the purpose of providing you with certain services.</p>

<br>
<p><b>3. SHARING OF INFORMATION</b></p>

<p>Except as described here, we will not provide any of your Personal Information to any third parties without your specific consent. We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate data and Usage Information with third parties. We may also share your information as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy Notice and in the following circumstances:</p>

<p><b>Third Parties Providing Services.</b> We may share your Personal Information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners) such as:

<p><b>Your Agreement to Have Your Personal Information Shared.</b> While on our Platforms, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party, including social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter. If you agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to the third party and the Personal Information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that third party.</p>

<p><b>Business Transfers.</b>  We may share your Personal Information with other entities and our affiliates primarily for business and operational purposes.

<br>
<p><b>4. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES</b></p>

<p>We may receive information about you from third parties such as consumer or other reporting agencies and medical or health care providers; or through your interactions with our affiliated companies. In addition, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from us, that website will submit to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third party website) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Usage Information and Personal Information such as lists of your friends, “likes”, comments you have shared, groups and location. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Platform to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections’” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service. We may supplement the information we collect about you through the Platforms with such information from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and/or to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>

<br>
<p><b>5. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS, CHOICE AND ACCESS</b></p>

In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Platforms. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. It may not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. We will retain your information (including geo-location data) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your online account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services through the platform, <a href="/secure/sendanemail?mmcom_id=webmaster">contact us</a>.
