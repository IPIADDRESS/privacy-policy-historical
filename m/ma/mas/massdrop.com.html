			<h1>MassDrop Privacy Policy</h1>
			<br>
	    	<dd>This <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>. This includes "Personal Information," which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, e-mail address, user ID number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing, as well as "Anonymous Information," which is information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.</dd>
			<br><hr><br>
			<h2>User Consent</h2>
			<dd>By accessing or otherwise using <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into and forms a part of the <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> terms of service (set forth on <a href="http://massdrop.com/terms-of-service">http://massdrop.com/terms-of-service</a>). You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Information may be processed and stored in other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Your Personal Information will not, however, be used or disclosed for purposes for which you have not given consent or which are not permitted under applicable law.</dd>
			<br><hr><br>
			<h2>Regarding Children</h2>
			<dd>Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information permanently from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent's permission before submitting information over the internet. By using <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have a parent's or guardian's permission to use <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>.</dd>
			<br><hr><br>
			<h2>Collection of Information</h2>
			<dt>Personal Information That You Provide</dt>
			<dd>In general, we collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>. We also collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>. For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, valid email address and password of your choice. When you personalize your profile and use the features of <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>, such as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information.

We may also collect information about you and your friends who use <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. For instance, we may collect your user ID or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and collections. When you purchase a Deal, you will need to submit your credit card or other payment information so that our service providers can process your payment for the Deal. When you sign up for, or win, any contests, sweepstakes, or other activities that we make available on <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>, we will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include your contact information such as your address and phone number.

			<dd>We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, "Partners") or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.</dd>
			<br>
			<dt>E-Mail And E-Mail Addresses</dt>
			<dd>If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our "Feedback" form through <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide. We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> or the social network from which you have connected to <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content). Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message) or notifications from a social network or other website with whom you have registered to receive such notifications. We may use this e-mail address to contact you, for things such as notifications of limited edition shop sales and other related information. You may indicate your preference to stop receiving further promotional communications as further detailed below.</dd>
			<br>
			<dt>Information Collected Via Technology</dt>
			<dd>As you use <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers' server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> you clicked. This type of information is collected to make <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> to meet your special interests and needs.</dd>
			<br>
			<dd>We engage in remarketing to market our sites across the web. When a user visits our site, a cookie is dropped on the user. Users with this cookie may be targeted across advertising networks to receive relevant advertisements. You may opt out of this ad serving using the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="blank">Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)</a> opt-out page (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>).</dd>
			<br>
			<dd>An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> to assist with ad targeting.</dd>
			<br>
			<dd>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. In order to use our services offered through <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> may not work properly, and you may not be able to receive our services.</dd>
			<br>
			<dd>We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.</dd>
			<br><hr><br>
			<h2>Use and Disclosure of Information</h2>
			<dd>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.</dd>
			<br>

Additionally, we do share your content preferences and other information with the social network with which you have connected to <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>, along with those companies and persons you have asked us to share your information with.</dd>

Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing customer service.

			<br>
			<dd>Additionally, we may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that would otherwise make the Anonymous Information personally identifiable to you. Generally, we aggregate this information and use it in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a>. This Privacy Policy does not limit our use or disclosure of any Anonymous Information in any way, and we reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties in our discretion.</dd>
			<br>
			<dd>We may share some or all of your Personal Information with <a href="http://massdrop.com">MassDrop.com</a> affiliated and group companies that are under a common control, so that they may send daily deal e-mails to you, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. Some of those companies may be located in countries that do not require an equivalent or greater level of protection of Personal Information.</dd>
			<br>
			<dd>In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer's assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</dd>

You hereby consent to us sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein.</dd>
