			an overview of Pearson's Privacy Policy which is wholly contained within the <a href="https://register.pearsoncmg.com/reg/include/license2.jsp">

			email address, username and password, phone number, and credit or debit card information. The name of the school you 
			attend or your workplace, date of birth, personal interests, and grade information is also considered personally 
			identifiable information when combined with PII.

			however, we may share this information with Pearson affiliated companies for the purpose of supporting the application. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Pearson may use PII to market (i.e. contact users for participation in focus groups, seminars, or product reviews, or 
			provide information on complimentary or upgrade products) only to users ages 13 and above who have opted in to receive 
			such information from Pearson.

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Within application rosters, grade books, or communication tools that facilitate instructor and student engagement. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Where disclosure is requested by the educational institution, school district or system in which the user is enrolled, 
				or by applicable state educational authorities, for educational or administrative purposes.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the event of suspected illegal conduct, misappropriating password access, violating Pearson Terms of Use or engaging 
				in academic misconduct or other conduct prohibited by an end-user’s academic institution or workplace.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			You should be aware that any PII voluntarily posted to a public area of a Pearson application (posting to a bulletin board or 
			chat room) might be collected and used by others. Pearson cannot prevent such uses.

			SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS: Pearson has no intention of seeking PII about minors (children under age 13). If obtained, 
			Pearson’s privacy policies will apply to that information. In addition, if Pearson can identify a user as a minor,

			information over the Internet, including through email.
