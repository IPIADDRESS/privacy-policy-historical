    Website Privacy Notice</font></strong><br>
    <font size="3">At Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), we are committed to 
    protecting the privacy and security of the users of our site. We understand 
    that health is a very personal, private subject, and we are committed to protecting 
    the privacy and security of visitors to our site. This Privacy Policy will 
    tell you what information we collect, how it is used, and what your choices 
    are. Please read this policy carefully. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><b>1. What personal information does MGH collect? <br>
    </b> You may use most of the MGH site without providing any personal information. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Sometimes we do need information to provide services that 
    you request. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3">When providing personal information via e-mail to the hospital, 
    please remember that e-mail messages can be viewed by other Internet users 
    while in transit. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3">If you have individualized information to communicate, please 
    use the appropriate secure on-line form or contact the necessary party using 
    traditional means such as phone or mail. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3">You may be asked to provide personal information, such as 
    demographic information, if you choose to complete any of the on-line forms 
    used for event registration, special events and promotions, appointment requests, 
    and to provide feedback. The information required to complete the transaction 
    is noted on the form. Additional questions may be included to help us improve 
    the services we offer. If you prefer not to enter your personal information 
    on the web site, please call MGH at 617-726-2000.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Only authorized MGH staff who need the information you provide 
    to perform a specific task have access to your information. All MGH hospital 
    staff are required to attend training on Privacy and Confidentiality. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Certain interactive patient transactions may be linked to 
    this site as a convenience for you. If you choose to utilize a specific patient 
    application, please be sure to read the privacy policy associated with that 
    particular transaction. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><b>2. In what ways is the collected information used? </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="3">MGH currently discloses personal information you provide on 
    the Web only to process credit card information or as required by law, and 
    has no current plans to make other disclosures of such information. We will 
    notify you through this on-line policy if there are any changes. <br>
    Requested information on voluntary forms is used to provide the services that 
    you request, such as registration for classes, mailing of publications, and 
    so forth. <br>
    MGH may occasionally provide statistics to third parties related to the number 
    of visitors who use the site. These statistics do not provide personally identifiable 
    information. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><b><br>
    3. Does MGH use "cookies" to collect user information? <br>
    </b> "Cookies" are small computer files that a web site can transfer 
    to your computer. Examples of information we collect include how often someone 
    visits our site and their activities while on our site. We use this information 
    in the aggregate to understand how our visitors as a group use different resources. 
    These reports do not contain any personally identifiable information. <br>
    Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can set your browser 
    to refuse them or to alert you when they are being sent.<br>
    <br>
    You can access the information on the MGH web site without having cookies 
    enabled in your browser. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><b>4. Are there advertisements on MGH web site? <br>
    </b> MGH does not accept advertisements on its Web Site.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><b>5. How does MGH handle privacy internally? <br>
    </b> MGH wants your personal information to remain as secure as possible. 
    Accordingly, we prevent unauthorized access by a secure firewall and use of 
    security infrastructure to protect the integrity and privacy of the personal 
    information you provide to us. As an additional security measure, your personal 
    information is also encrypted during transmission by Secure Socket Layer 128-bit 
    encryption software. (Encryption is a common method used to transmit sensitive 
    data across the Internet. Encryption temporarily makes the text unreadable 
    during the time it is being transmitted over the Internet.) </font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Please note, that for encryption to work, your browser must 
    be Netscape or Internet Explorer version 4.0 or higher. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><b>6. Which web pages and web sites does this policy apply 
    to? <br>
    </b> This Privacy Policy applies only to the MGH Web site. The MGH site does 
    contain links to other sites. Please be aware that this policy does not apply 
    to sites that MGH only links to. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policies 
    on any other sites before providing them with personal information. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><b>7. Your Consent. <br>
    </b> By using the MGH Web site, you agree to acceptance of this Privacy Policy. 
    We may occasionally need to make changes to our Privacy Policy, to reflect 
    changes in our site and address new issues. Changes will be posted here, so
