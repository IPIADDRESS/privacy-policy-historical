        <p>WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we’re starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world.

<p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you create your membership and/or subscribe to member updates or other in house mail. We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
    <li>To help you quickly find software, services or information.</li>
    <li>To help us create content most relevant to you.</li>
    <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from MastermindPros.com.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br>

If you do not want us to communicate with you about other offers regarding MastermindPros.com products, programs, events, or services by email, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from MastermindPros.com.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br>

<p>MastermindPros.com strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
<p>Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above.

<p><strong>ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION</strong></p>
<p>When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you’ve already left with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you haven’t previously registered with us, we create a personal profile for you from your product registration information. If you ever want to review or update that information, you can click on Update Profile, and edit any of the Personal Information in your profile. If you haven’t already created a membership, we will ask you to do so. This ensures that only you can access your information.</p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMER PROFILES</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification username, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.</p>
<p>When you register, you create your profile, your username and password. It is your passport to seamless travel across your member area, allowing you to download software and order more plugin modules without having to fill out registration forms with information you’ve already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won’t have to re-register – just use your Registration ID to identify yourself.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</strong></p>
<p>When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, our 3rd party payment processors such as paypal and 2checkout will ask for your credit card number and billing address. They use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time.</p>
<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including programming, answering customer questions about products or services, sending email and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>MastermindPros.com will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on MastermindPros.com or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of MastermindPros.com and its family of Websites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of MastermindPros.com, its Websites, or the public.</p>    </div>
