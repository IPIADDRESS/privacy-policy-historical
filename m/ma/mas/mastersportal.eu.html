This privacy policy sets out how StudyPortals uses and protects any information that you give when you use this website. </p><p>StudyPortals is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Any information you provide by which you can be identified when using this website, it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.</p><h2>Navigation Tracking</h2><p>We collect information on all visitors of the website. We require this information to help us understand your needs and provide you and our members with a better service. We might share some of this information with our partners, but always anonymously and only in the aggregate.</p><h2>Personal Information </h2><p>In some of our pages, personal information such as names and email addresses. These will not be shared with third parties unless the owner has agreed to this. We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this to happen.</p><p>If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible, at our published addresses. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.</p><h2>Members</h2><p>We record all logins to our sites by our members. This information is used in aggregate to monitor levels of usage and functionality. It is stored individually so that we can feed this information back to our members on an individual basis.</p><h2>Security</h2><p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. </p><h2>How we use Cookies</h2><p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. </p><p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to user needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system. </p><p>Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. </p><p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p><h2>Links to other Websites</h2><p>Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.</p><h2>Periodic Emails</h2><p><span>If you register to receive periodic email updates about StudyPortals, we may send to you periodic emails and newsletters containing information about us, new or updated programmes, and customer satisfaction questions. Currently, we think we will send these emails monthly. In addition, we may send promotional communication from universities which we think may be relevant to you.<span class="small"> When we do this, we do not disclose your name and address to the respective university.</span></span></p><p><span>The registration form requires you to provide personal information (including name and email address). We do not intend to sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. </span></p><p><span>We do presently aggregate personally identifiable information and knowingly disclose such information in aggregate for a number of business purposes, but in these situations we do not, in the normal course, disclose to other entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.</span></p><p><span>If you have provided additional information upon registration for our periodic emails by which we are able to personalize the content, we may use the information to filter the content we deliver to you and to provide you with content we believe may be relevant to you.<br> In addition to the periodic emails described above, we may use your email address to send you administrative notices about your account.</span></p><p><span class="small"><span>To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from MastersPortal.eu.</span></span></p><p>You <span>can see, review and change most of your personal information </span><span>by clicking "Manage my subscription" at the bottom of the periodic emails</span><span>. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.</span></p><p><span>Upon your request, we will deactivate your registration as soon as reasonably possible. Express your request by clicking "Manage my subscription" at the bottom of the periodic emails. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</span></p><h2><span>Contacting Universities for Information</span></h2><p><span>When a Visitor voluntarily contacts a University through our website, the University is provided with the VisitorÂ´s personally identifiable contact information. MastersPortal.eu cannot be held responsible for following correspondence, privacy violation or whatsoever. </span></p><h2><span class="small"><span>Business Transfers</span></span></h2><p><span class="small"><span>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, Visitor information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Statement. Also, in the event that StudyPortals, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, Visitor information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</span></span></p><h2>Changes to this Policy</h2><p>StudyPortals may change this policy from time to time by updating this page.
