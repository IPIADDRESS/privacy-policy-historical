<p>Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. MEF, LLC may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags), in connection with the Website to, among other things, track the activities of Website visitors, help MEF, LLC manage content, and compile statistics about Website usage. MEF, LLC and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to customers of independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations to help MEF, LLC track email response rates, identify when emails are viewed, and track whether emails are forwarded, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Analytics:</strong></p>
<p>MEF, LLC uses automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of the Website and, to the extent permitted, the Application(s). MEF, LLC and/or independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations also may use other analytic means to evaluate the Service. MEF, LLC uses these tools to help it improve the Service, performance, and user experiences. These third-party entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. MEF, LLC and independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations do not share your PII with these third parties, however.</p>
<p><strong>Do-Not-Track:</strong></p>
<p>Currently, the Website and Application(s) do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third-Party Ad Networks section below.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Ad Networks:</strong></p>
<p>MEF, LLC uses third parties, such as network advertisers, to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables MEF, LLC and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products offered by MEF, LLC and products and services offered by independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.</p>
<p>Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Consumer Choice Page</a> for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/participating/">DAA companies</a>. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by third-party companies who are <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks">NAI members</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Consumer Choice Page</a> or the NAI <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> will remove you from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through the Website or on other third-party websites. Even if you opt out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page, you may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info</a> or the NAI’s website at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
