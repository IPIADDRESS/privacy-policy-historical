<p><strong>Business Transitions:</strong></p>
<p>In the event MEF, LLC goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, PII of users collected by MEF, LLC through the Website and/or Application(s) will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on the Website and Application(s) for 30 days after a transfer of their PII, if PII will be used contrary to this policy. If as a result of the business transition, the users’ PII will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given the option to continue to share their information consistent with the notification of changes section on this Website and/or Application(s).

MEF, LLC specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of PII collected from the Website and/or Application(s) to the entity to whom that portion of its business relating to that information is transferred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event an independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>®</sup> franchised location goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, PII of users collected by such independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>®</sup> franchised location through the Website and/or Application(s) will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

You hereby acknowledge and agree that the ME Entities (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) are not responsible for any damages, harm, or violation of law that may arise from the failure of an independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>®</sup> franchised location to provide this notification to you.

<h3 class="me-article__content__heading me-tertiary-header--no-line"><strong> Cookies and other Tracking Mechanisms:</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>MEF, LLC, independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations, and/or our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of the Website and/or Service. MEF, LLC and/or independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations may combine this information with other PII &nbsp;collected from you (and third-party service providers may do so on behalf of MEF, LLC and/or independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations).</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that MEF, LLC transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow MEF, LLC to make it easier for you to navigate the Website and Service, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow MEF, LLC to track your activities at the Website and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. MEF, LLC uses session cookies to allow its systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Website. This allows MEF, LLC to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through the Website.</li>
<li>Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. MEF, LLC uses persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disabling Cookies:</strong></p>
<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to the Website who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Website, but some features may not function.</p>
<p><strong>Clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies:</strong></p>
<p>Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. MEF, LLC may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags), in connection with the Website to, among other things, track the activities of Website visitors, help MEF, LLC manage content, and compile statistics about Website usage. MEF, LLC and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to customers of independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations to help MEF, LLC track email response rates, identify when emails are viewed, and track whether emails are forwarded, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Analytics:</strong></p>
<p>MEF, LLC uses automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of the Website and, to the extent permitted, the Application(s). MEF, LLC and/or independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations also may use other analytic means to evaluate the Service. MEF, LLC uses these tools to help it improve the Service, performance, and user experiences. These third-party entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. MEF, LLC and independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations do not share your PII with these third parties, however.</p>
<p><strong>Do-Not-Track:</strong></p>
<p>Currently, the Website and Application(s) do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third-Party Ad Networks section below.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Ad Networks:</strong></p>
<p>MEF, LLC uses third parties, such as network advertisers, to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables MEF, LLC and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products offered by MEF, LLC and products and services offered by independently owned and operated Massage Envy<sup>® </sup>franchised locations in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.</p>
<p>Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Consumer Choice Page</a> for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/participating/">DAA companies</a>. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by third-party companies who are <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks">NAI members</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Consumer Choice Page</a> or the NAI <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> will remove you from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through the Website or on other third-party websites. Even if you opt out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page, you may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
