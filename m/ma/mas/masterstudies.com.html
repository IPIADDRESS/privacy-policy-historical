<div id="main fullwidth"><div class="artikkel article_fullwidth"><h1>Privacy policy</h1><p>The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world. It's important to Masterstudies to help our users and customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.</p>
<p>We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is important to you and to us. So we'll protect the information you share with us. To protect your privacy, Masterstudies follows different principles in accordance with worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>We won't sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, email address or any other information to anyone. </li>
<li>We will use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from unauthorized users.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE</strong></p>
<p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you create a Registration ID on the site or when you download free software, enter a contest, order email newsletters or join a limited-access premium site. We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once. </li>
<li>To help you quickly find software, services or information. </li>
<li>To help us create content most relevant to you. </li>
<li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Masterstudies. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CONSENT <br></strong></p>
<p>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of our website. But you will not be able to access areas that require registration.</p>
<p>If you decide to register, you will be able to select the kinds of information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various services, like our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us to communicate with you about other offers regarding Masterstudies products, programs, events, or services by email, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from Masterstudies.</p>
<p>Masterstudies occasionally allows other companies to offer our registered customers information about their products and services, using mail. If you do not want to receive these offers, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing materials from third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ACCESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time on our website. There, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>View and edit personal information you have already given us. </li>
<li>Tell us whether you want us to send you marketing information, or whether you want third parties to send you their offers by postal mail. </li>
<li>Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products. </li>
<li>Register. Once you register, you won't need to do it again. Wherever you go on our website, your information stays with you. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Masterstudies has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. .</p>
<p>Masterstudies strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
<p>Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in countries where Masterstudies, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.</p>
<p>You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these with others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ENFORCEMENT </strong></p>
<p>If for some reason you believe Masterstudies has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at webmaster@masterstudies.com and we will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMER PROFILES <br></strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.</p>
<p>When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal identification number, and then send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your passport to seamless travel across the Masterstudies website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What we do with the information you share</strong></p>
<p>When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates about your account, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer.</p>
<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Masterstudies will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Masterstudies or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Masterstudies and its family of Websites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Masterstudies, its Websites, or the public.</p> <br><br>
