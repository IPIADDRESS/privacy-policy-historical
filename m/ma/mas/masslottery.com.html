          <br>
          Information that you provide to us through this site may be made available 
          to members of the public under that law. This policy informs you of 
          the information that we collect from you at this site, what we do with 
          it, to whom it may be disseminated,<font color="#000000"> and how you

          choice about your use of this site. You can maximize the benefits of 
          your privacy partnership with the Commonwealth by making informed choices 
          about whether to share personally identifiable information with us through 
          this site.</p>
        <p><b>Personally Identifiable Information.</b> We use the term "personally 
          identifiable information" to mean any information that could reasonably 
          be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, 
          Social Security number, birth date, bank account information, credit 
          card information, or any combination of information that could be used

          of your visit, whether a file you have requested exists, and how many 
          "bytes" of information were transmitted to you over the Web 
          from this site. We use your IP address to assess the frequency of visits 
          to this site and the popularity of its various pages and functions. 
          We will not attempt to match any personally identifiable information 
          that you provide to us with your IP address, unless there are reasonable 
          grounds to believe that doing so would provide information that is relevant 
          and material to a criminal investigation.</p>
        <p><b>Information Collected and How it is Used</b>.<br>
          If you visit the Lottery's web site and browse, read pages or download 
          information, we will gather and store certain information about your 
          visit. This information does not identify you personally. <br>
          <br>
          We automatically collect and store the following information about your

        <ul>
          <li> The<a href="#ip"> Internet Protocol ("IP")Address</a><a href="#"> 
            </a>and domain name used. </li>
          <li>The type of browser and operating system you used.</li>
          <li> The date and time you visited this site.</li>
          <li>The web pages or services you accessed at this site. <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p> The information we automatically collect is used to improve the content 
          of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our 
          services. The Lottery analyzes this information to determine how our 
          web site is being used, so that we may continually improve the site's 
          usefulness to the public. </p>
        <p><b>Dissemination of Your Personally Identifiable Information.</b> We 
          do not sell any personally identifiable information collected through 
          this Web site. However, once you voluntarily submit personally identifiable 
          information to us through an e-mail, its dissemination is governed by 
          the <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/legis/laws/mgl/66-10.htm"> Public 
          Records Law</a>, the <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/legis/laws/mgl/gl-66A-toc.htm"> 
          Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 66A (Fair Information Practices Act) 
          </a> , <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/consumer/New/privexeco.htm"> 
          Executive Order 412</a>, and other applicable laws and regulations. 
          <b>For this reason, part or all of the information you send us may be 
          provided to a member of the public in response to a public records request.</b></p>
        <p>In addition, the information that you voluntarily submit will be disclosed 
          only to Commonwealth employees or officials with a "need to know" 
          for purposes of fulfilling their job responsibilities. They will only 
          use the information to answer your questions, respond to any requests 
          for assistance, and fulfill the Commonwealth's legal obligations. Where 
          appropriate, we may provide the information submitted by you to the 
          person or company that is the subject of your inquiry, or to a government 
          agency responsible for the matters referred to in your communication.</p>
        <p><b>Your Access and Opportunity to Correct.</b> The <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/legis/laws/mgl/66-10.htm"> 
          Public Records Law</a> and the <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/legis/laws/mgl/gl-66A-toc.htm"> 
          Fair Information Practices Act </a> provide you certain rights to get 
          information about you that is in our records. To learn more about the 
          circumstances under which you can get and correct this information, 
          please click on the above references to these laws.</p>
        <p><b>Security.</b> Because this site does not encrypt incoming e-mail, 
          you should not send information that you consider highly sensitive through 
          this Web site. We use standard security measures to ensure that your 
          personally identifiable information is not lost, misused, altered, or 
          unintentionally destroyed. We also use software programs to monitor 
          network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change 
          information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement 
          investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or 
          their usage habits.</p>
        <p><b>Special Protections Against Misuse Of Personally Identifiable Information 
          Within Commonwealth Offices.</b> In 1999, then-Acting Governor Swift 
          issued <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/consumer/New/privexeco.htm"> 
          Executive Order 412</a>, which enhanced the privacy protection given 
          to any information about you as a named individual held by the Executive 
          Department of state government. <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/consumer/New/privexeco.htm"> 
          Executive Order 412</a> limits the collection and dissemination of personally 
          identifiable information within the Executive Department. This site 
          complies with Executive Order 412, so all of the personally identifiable 
          information that you submit to this site is given the privacy protections 
          set forth in <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/consumer/New/privexeco.htm"> 
          Executive Order 412</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Policy changes.</b> We will post changes to this policy at least 
          30 days before they take effect. Any information we collect under the 
          current privacy policy will remain subject to the terms of this policy. 
          After any changes take effect, all new information we collect, if any, 
          will be subject to the new policy.</p>

        <p><a name="cookies"><b>Cookies</b></a> are files that a Web site can 
          place on your computer. A cookie file contains unique information that 
          a Web site can use to track such things as your password, lists of Web 
          pages you have visited, and the date when you last looked at a specific 
          Web page, or to identify your session at a particular Web site. A cookie 
          file allows the Web site to recognize you as you click through pages 
          on the site and when you later revisit the site. A Web site can use 
          cookies to "remember" your preferences, and to record your 
          browsing behavior on the Web. Although you can prevent Web sites from 
          placing cookies on your computer by using your browser's preference

        <a name="ip"><b>An "Internet Protocol Address" or "IP Address"</b></a> 
        is a series of numbers that identifies each computer and machine connected

        disclosed to us may identify the computer from which you are accessing 
        the Internet, or a server owned by your Internet Service Provider. Because 
        it is machine-specific, rather than person-specific, an IP address is 
        not, in and of itself, personally identifiable information. </td>
