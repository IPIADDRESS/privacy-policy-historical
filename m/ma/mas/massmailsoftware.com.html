<h2>COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>Browsing</h3>
<p>This Website does not collect personally identifiable information from your 
  computer when you browse the Website and request pages from our servers. This

  identifiable information, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or 
  any other personally identifiable information. When you request a page from 
  our Website, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header, 
  JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP number, the time of 
  the request, the URL of your request and other information. We collect such 
  information in order to make our Website function correctly and provide you 
  the functionality that you see on this Website, as our servers use this information 
  to deliver to you the pages on this Website. We also use this information to 
  better understand how visitors use our Website and how we can better tune our

<p>The Website does not process any personally identifiable data and does not 
  combine the processing data with any personal information. If you do not wish 
  the information collected as stated above, by the Website, to be processed by 
  us, you should notify your request by sending an e-mail to: medik@atompark.com 
</p>
<h3>Information Collection</h3>
<p>As a visitor to this Website, you can engage in many activities without providing 
  any personal information as described above in Section Browsing. In connection 
  with other activities, such as subscribing to the services offered on the Website, 
  utilising online software applications or purchasing any of the products and 
  services available on the Website, AtomPark Software Inc. may ask you to voluntarily 
  supply us with certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting 
  an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities 
  and/or make any purchases. If you elect to engage in these activities or make 
  purchases, however, AtomPark Software Inc. may ask that you provide us personal 
  information, defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, 
  contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including but 
  not limited to your first and last name, mailing address or street address (including 
  ZIP/Post code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone 
  and facsimile numbers, and other.</p>
<p>You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of 
  information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested 
  information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent 
  upon the collection of this information. Depending upon the activity, some of 
  the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some 
  as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular 
  activity or purchase, you will not be able to engage in that activity or make 
  such a purchase.<br>
  AtomPark Software Inc. is the sole owner of the information it gathers on its 
  site. AtomPark Software Inc. will only share your information with outside parties
