	<br>
	<span class="heads_1"><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>
		This statement does not apply to our commercial customers.</li>
	<li>
		If when you provide your personal information you indicate your residence as outside India, you may be offered a privacy notice that is specific to your country of residence. In such case, MAA TV is operating this site for itself as well as a service provider for its global affiliates.</li>
	<li>
		On our co-branded sites (such as those sites where MAA TV has presented content together with one of our retail partners) a privacy notice unique to that site may be presented.</li>
	<li>
		Private sites (such as those only available to dealers and distributors) and sites created for our employees (or prospective employees) may also have privacy notices unique to those sites.</li>
	<li>
		Sites maintained by MAA TV subsidiaries and affiliates, although linked to MAA TV.com, have their own online privacy notices.</li>
</ul>

	<span class="heads_1"><strong>Your Personal Information</strong></span><br>

However, while we strive to protect your personal information, you must also take steps to protect your information. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal information while you are on the Internet.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="heads_1"><strong>Communities</strong></span><br>
	<strong> </strong>

MAA TV does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13, except with their parent's express consent.<br>
	<br>
	If we ever include children under the age of 13 as part of our intended site audience, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice; and we will provide processes to obtain parental approval, provide access to information and allow parents to request removal of their children's personal information.<br>
