    <li>Private sites (such as those only available to dealers and
      distributors) and sites created for our employees (or prospective
      employees) may also have privacy notices unique to those sites.</li>

    <br>
    <span class="heads_1">Here are the types of information we gather.</span> <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Information You Explicitly Provide:</strong><br>
    <br>
    In order to establish your account, register programs, or to
    participate in various online programs offered through MAA TV.com, you
    will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information to
    us such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone

      Information We Automatically Collect: </strong><br>
    <br>
    We use common internet technologies such as cookies and beacons to
    ensure the integrity of our site and to customize portions of the site
    for you. <br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Cookies<br>
  </strong><br>
    Cookies are small pieces of information
    stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive, at a website's
    request. MAA TV cookies do not contain any personal information, but
    are used primarily as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to keep track of temporary information. For example, cookies allow us to keep track of the pictures you upload and download; </li>
    <li>to register you in programs, such as MAA TV.com Membership. Cookies
      allow us to remember you when you login to the places on our site that
      require Membership; </li>
    <li>to remember your country and language preferences; </li>
    <li>to help us understand the size of our audience and traffic patterns; </li>
    <li>to collect and record information about what you viewed on our Website and what you viewed in our e-mail; </li>
    <li>to manage and present site information and the pictures displayed on your computer, and </li>
    <li>to deliver information specific to your interests. </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Web Beacons<br>
  </strong><br>
                      We also place small "tracker gifs" or "beacons" on many of the pages on
                      our website, in online advertising with third parties, and in our
                      e-mail. We use these beacons, in connection with cookies, to collect
                      non-personal data on the usage of our site including but not limited to
                      the date and time of the visit, the pages visited, the referring web
                      page, the type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, NetScape), the type
                      of operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, or Mac), and the domain name
                      of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g., AOL). This
                      information is collected about thousands of site visits and analyzed as
                      a whole. This information is useful in, for example, tracking the
                      performance of our online advertising such as online banner ads and to
                      determine where to place future advertising on other Websites.<br>

  <span class="heads_1"><strong>Protecting Your Information</strong></span><br>
  <br>
                      MAA TV implements a variety of administrative, managerial, and
                      technical security measures to help protect your personal information.
                      MAA TV has Internal Control Standards which relate specifically to the
                      handling of personal information. These include certain controls to
                      help safeguard the information we collect online. <br>
  <br>
                      MAA TV employees are trained to understand and comply with these
                      controls and we communicate our Privacy Notice, practices and
                      guidelines to our employees. However, while we strive to protect your
                      personal information, you must also take steps to protect your
                      information. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your
                      personal information while you are on the Internet. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="heads_1"><strong>Communities</strong></span><strong><br>
  </strong><br>
                      Some of our sites may enable you to participate in public services such
                      as discussion boards, chats, and live events. Please use discretion
                      when posting personal information about yourself when using these
                      services. Be aware that when you disclose personal information at these
                      sites, such as your name, member name, e-mail address, etc., the
                      information may be collected and used by others to send unsolicited
                      e-mail. The services are open to the public, and what you post there
                      can be seen by anyone and is not protected. MAA TV cannot control the
                      comments that you may receive while you participate in these services.
                      You may find other people's comments to be offensive, harmful or
                      inaccurate.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="heads_1"><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></span><br>
  <br>
                      Protecting the online privacy of children is especially important, and
                      those under the age of 13 are protected by law. For that reason, MAA TV
                      does not knowingly permit children under the age of 13 to become
                      registered members of our sites, without verifiable parental consent.
                      MAA TV does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about
                      children under 13, except with their parent's express consent.<br>
  <br>
                      If we ever include children under the age of 13 as part of our intended
                      site audience, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the
                      provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be
                      clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice; and we will
                      provide processes to obtain parental approval, provide access to
                      information and allow parents to request removal of their children's
                      personal information.<br>
  <br>
                      MAA TV encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their
                      children online and to participate in their interactive activities and
                      interests.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="heads_1"><strong>Outside Links</strong></span><br>
