                              <p><b>7. What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information?</b> </p>
                              <p>It may not be a norm but the fact remains that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure always.

In nutshell, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the other public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>
                              <p>Finally, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any registration information. Please be careful and responsible on your own whenever you're online.</p>
                              <p><b>9. Is there any children's privacy?</b> </p>
                              <p>Yes, the safety of children is very important to us. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to MapmyIndia.com or to anyone online for that matter. MapmyIndia.com does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties under any circumstances unless there is a special situation and such information is requested by law enforcing agency and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of their age.
