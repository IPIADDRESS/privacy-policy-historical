Who is collecting information?</b><br>When you are on a MapQuest.com site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information for use by MapQuest.com alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. Some MapQuest.com services may be offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this service to you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. In such cases you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. <br><br>

<a name="5"></a><b>5. With whom does MapQuest.com share my information? </b><br>As a general rule, MapQuest.com will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed. <br><br>



<div class="indent"><div class="indent"><b>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors:</b> MapQuest.com may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Some or all data collected during a MapQuest.com promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. <br><br>

Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give MapQuest.com permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. 
<br><br>


<b>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate:</b> Under confidentiality agreements, MapQuest.com may match user information with third party data.

<a name="6"></a><b>6. What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?</b><br>If you express interest in receiving offers or information from MapQuest.com and our partners, we may occasionally send you e-mail or postal mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only MapQuest.com (or agents working on behalf of MapQuest.com and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. <br><br>

At any time you can easily unsubscribe from MapQuest.com's mailing list and no longer receive such offers and mailings. <br><br>

On some types of MapQuest.com promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you may automatically receive promotion-related email. Occasionally these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements. <br><br>

You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those MapQuest.com services that require the use of cookies in order to participate. <br><br>

MapQuest.com does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests.

<a name="7"></a><b>7. How does MapQuest.com protect my personal financial information?</b><br>Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us. As with all personal information, MapQuest.com will never rent or sell your personal financial information. Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements. But as with all personally identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties without your permission. <br><br>

Please note that there may be places on the MapQuest.com network of Web sites where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.

<a name="8"></a><b>8. What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?</b><br>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, MapQuest.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

<a name="9"></a><b>9. What about children's privacy?</b><br>Naturally, the safety of children is very important to us. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to MapQuest.com, or to anyone online for that matter. MapQuest.com does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of age. In addition, MapQuest.com will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 13 without first obtaining their parents' permission.

<a name="10"></a><b>10. What else should I know about my privacy?</b><br>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. <br><br>

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any registration information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
