      <p>
        This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 
        'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy 
        law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information 
        to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. 
        Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, 
        protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our 
        website.

          <p>
            When creating an account on this site, you have a few options.  You may login in with your email 
            address, and create a password unique to this site.  In this case, we collect your email address.
            You may also log in via either Facebook or Google.  In either of these cases, we do not collect your 
            Facebook or Google account credentials, but we do get a token from either Facebook or Google, which
            can be used to identify you as a unique person. In this case, we do not collect any other information,
            including email address, name, or anything else. This token just allows us to distinguish you from 
            another user on the site.

        <dt>Do we use 'cookies'?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's 
            hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's 
            systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, 
            we use cookies to help us remember which maps were created by you. They are also 
            used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which 
            enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate 
            data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and 
            tools in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use cookies to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep track of advertisements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better 
              site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third party services that 
              track this information on our behalf.

          </ul>
          <p>
            You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose 
            to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each 
            browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to 
            modify your cookies.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>If users disable cookies in their browser:</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            If you disable cookies off, some features will be disabled It will turn off some of the features 
            that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.
            For instance, you may repeatedly see informational messages that you have dismissed on prior visits 
            to the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            With cookies disabled, you will still be able to create maps, but you will not be able to edit or 
            delete them, since there will be no way to connect you to the maps you have created.

            partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business,

            Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the 
            DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other

            ad and content network privacy policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have implemented the following:

          </ul>
          <p>
            We along with third-party vendors, such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google 
            Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party 
            identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions, and other 
            ad service functions as they relate to our website.

            Opting out: Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings 
            page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising initiative opt out page or 
            permanently using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.

        <dt>California Online Privacy Protection Act</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services 
            to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person 
            or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting 
            personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy 
            policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals 
            with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: 
            <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Users can visit our site anonymously
          </p>
          <p>
            Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum 
            on the first significant page after entering our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified 
            above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              On our Privacy Policy Page
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Users are able to change their personal information:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                By emailing us at <a href="mailto:accounts@mapcustomizer.com">accounts@mapcustomizer.com</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
        </dd>
        <dt>How does our site handle do not track signals?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            We honor do not track signals and do not track or plant cookies when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser 
            mechanism is in place.  Please keep in mind that when we are not planting cookies, we cannot link
            maps to the user that created them, so you will not be able to edit or delete maps that you create
            when you have DNT enabled.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to log in, then we will be able to associate the maps you create with your account, 
            since the action of logging in overrides the passive DNT signal.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking.

        <dt>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's 
            Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the 
            nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of 
            websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not specifically market to children under 13.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Fair Information Practices</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States 
            and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data 
            protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and 
            how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that 
            protect personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We will notify the users via email: Within 7 business days
            </li>
            <li>
              We will notify the users via in site notification: Within 7 business days
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a 
            right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail 
            to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable 
            rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government 
            agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

        <dt>CAN SPAM Act</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for 
            commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, 
            and spells out tough penalties for violations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We collect your email address in order to identify you as a unique user on the site, and allow 
            you to manage (ie, edit or delete) maps that you have created.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:
          </p>
