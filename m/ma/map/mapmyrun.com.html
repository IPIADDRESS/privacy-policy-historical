<p><b>Information We Collect And How We Use It </b></p>
<p>We offer a number of Services that do not require a User to register for an account or provide any personal information or location information to us, such as MapMyFitness Basic Route Creation Tool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Personal Information A User Provides</b></p>
<p>When a User signs up for a MapMyFitness Account or other MapMyFitness Services that require registration, we ask him or her to submit select personal information.&nbsp; Personal information is any information that identifies a User personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.&nbsp; Personal information may therefore include, but is not limited to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the Services feature or include various location-based components.&nbsp; To provide these location-based features, MapMyFitness and our partners and licensees may collect, use and share a User’s precise location information, including the real-time geographic location of a User’s mobile device. For some third-party partners, such as Google, this location information will be shared automatically. For others, such as Facebook, this information will only be shared with a User’s explicit permission or if you choose to share it..&nbsp; Location information includes, but is not limited to, any information we derive in order to identify a User’s geographic position.&nbsp; This information may be collected from a User’s wireless carrier, certain third party service providers, or directly from the mobile device that the User previously registered for use with MapMyFitness.&nbsp; The collection and tracking of a User’s location information may occur even when the MapMyFitness mobile phone application is not actively open and running.&nbsp; A User’s location information, however, is only displayed and shared in accordance with his or her established privacy settings.</p>
<p>We may combine the personal information and/or the location information that a User submits under his or her account with information from other Services or third parties in order to provide that User&nbsp; with an enhanced experience and/or to improve the overall quality of the Services.&nbsp; For certain Services, we may give a User an opportunity to opt out of the combination of such information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aggregated Information</b></p>

This aggregate information does not identify a User personally. MapMyFitness may also disclose aggregated information in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MapMyFitness Privacy Settings and Online Disclosures </b></p>
<p>MapMyFitness provides its Users with three privacy setting options for their accounts-”Public,” “Friends Only,” and “Private.” These privacy settings control who can view a User’s online disclosures, including certain Users personal information and location information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MapMyFitness sets User default privacy settings to “Friends Only.” A “Friends Only” privacy setting limits access to a User’s online disclosures. Only certain personal information that a User discloses and/or transmits to MapMyFitness via the MapMyFitness Websites and/or the Mobile Applications—specifically, MapMyFitness user name, first name and first initial of the last name, and any profile picture or associated with a MapMyFitness User—while that User maintains a “Friends Only” privacy setting, is disclosed or accessible to the general public. All other personal information and/or location information that a User discloses and/or transmits to MapMyFitness is only disclosed to and accessible by only those persons who that User has previously designated as “Friends” and MapMyFitness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A “Private” privacy setting further limits access to the personal information and location information that a User discloses and/or transmits to MapMyFitness via the MapMyFitness Websites and/or the Mobile Applications.&nbsp; Specifically, no personal information or location information that a User discloses and or transmits to MapMyFitness while that User maintains a “Private” privacy setting, is disclosed to, or accessible by, that User’s Friends or the general public. Said information is only disclosed to and accessible by the User and MapMyFitness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To permit the general public or any third parties, including other Users, to view a User’s online disclosures, a User must actively and specifically employ a “Public” privacy setting; save his or her routes as “Public”; or otherwise use or access Services that require a User to make use of a “Public” privacy setting. Further, a User should be aware that certain personal information or location information that he or she voluntarily discloses online by means of his or her employment of Services that require a “Public” privacy setting may become publicly available and could be read, collected, and/or used by third parties, including other Users, in ways unknown to MapMyFitness. MapMyFitness is not responsible for any such use of a User’s personal information or location information by any third party. MapMyFitness therefore recommends that a User actively manage his or her privacy settings on an ongoing basis, so that he or she can effectively guard against the unauthorized use or abuse of his or her personal information or location information by others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Log File Information</b></p>
<p>When a User accesses or uses the Services, our servers automatically record information from that User’s mobile device and web browser.&nbsp; These server logs may include, but are not limited to, information such as a User’s web requests, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of that User’s request, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, cookies that may uniquely identify a User’s browser, and elements employed in the Mobile Applications.</p>
