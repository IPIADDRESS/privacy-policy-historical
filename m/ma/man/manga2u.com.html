              <p>Not withstanding the foregoing, manga2u  may choose to retain   some personal information such as the child's e-mail  address as a means   to prevent the child from re-registering at our website. The    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) went into effect in   April  2000, and as a result websites all over the world wide web had to   change their  standards to not collect any information from a child.</p>
