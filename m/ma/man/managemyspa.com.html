  <h1><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
  <p><a name="pagetop" id="pagetop"></a>Effective January 01, 2011</p>
  <p> ManageMySpa.Com is committed to protecting your privacy and  earning your trust. This policy discloses our privacy practices for personal  information you provide to us. This policy explains how we collect, use and  safeguard your personal information. It is our intent to give you as much  control as reasonably practicable over your privacy and personal information  and the use we make of it in our business. We may, in our sole discretion,  change this policy from time to time by posting a revised version on our web  site ("ManageMySpa.Com ") or otherwise publicly disseminating it, so  please check back from time to time.</p>
  <h3> <strong>What kinds of personal information does ManageMySpa  collect?</strong></h3>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>We ask       for personal information when you become a registered with &nbsp;ManageMySpa .com, purchase our products       or services. For example, such information might include your name,       address, telephone number, email address, and other information related to       you or your business. You are required to register and receive a logon       name to be able to access and use certain features of the ManageMySpa       Site. We also request certain other optional information that will enable       us to provide you with a more personalized experience when using the ManageMySpa       Site. We will let you know what information is optional, and you can       decide whether or not you want to provide that information or to receive       newsletters or third party correspondence. </li>
    <li>We ask       for personal information from you during the course of discussing or       providing our products and services. </li>
    <li>We ask       for personal information when you enter a contest, sweepstakes or other       promotion sponsored by ManageMySpa or its partners. </li>
    <li>We       also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us refine       and improve the design and layout of our ManageMySpa Site and the user experience. </li>
    <li>If you       send us personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, we may keep a       record of that correspondence.

If       you respond to these requests, we may keep a record of your response. </li>
    <li>We       also collect IP addresses for system administration </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>How does ManageMySpa use my information?</strong></h3>

  <ul type="disc">
    <li>We use       the personal information as necessary to provide you with our services. </li>
    <li>We do       not access or use the personal information you store on our servers       through our hosting services, except to provide such services, to provide       support in connection with such services, to test, troubleshoot and       improve our products and services, or as otherwise authorized or requested       by you. </li>

    <li>We       will deliver targeted advertisements to our customers using the personal       information you give us and that we collect. Third parties provide us with       advertisements and identify an audience they want to reach. We display       these advertisements on our Web site to people who fit the criteria. We do       not allow advertisers to have access to individual account information.       These advertisements are usually banner ads and promotional e-mails. </li>

    <li>We       compile and analyze personal information on an aggregate or anonymous       basis to model industry trends, do market analysis, and to publish       industry research papers identifying trends in the marketplace. Such       industry research papers contain aggregate and anonymous data only, and do       not contain any personal information that can be used to identify you. </li>
    <li>We use       the IP addresses we collect to report aggregate or anonymous information       to our advertisers. </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> <strong>Who collects information?</strong></h3>
  <p>    When you supply personal information to ManageMySpa, you  share that information only with ManageMySpa unless you are specifically  informed otherwise. If a company other than ManageMySpa is gathering or  maintaining your personal data from the ManageMySpa Site, you will be told  before it is collected or transferred. You can always choose not to share the  information.</p>
  <p> When companies other than ManageMySpa sponsor promotions,  data collected on the ManageMySpa Site in connection with these promotions may  be shared with the sponsor. Once again, if this is the case, you will be  notified before the data is collected or transferred, and you can decide not to  participate.</p>
  <p> If you leave the ManageMySpa Site using links to go to other  third party Web sites, those third parties may gather information about you.  This privacy policy does not cover the practices of those businesses.</p>
  <h3> <strong>Does ManageMySpa share my information?</strong></h3>
  <p>    Other than as stated in this policy, ManageMySpa does not  disclose any of your personal information to third parties without your  permission. Read the following sections to learn more.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Business       partners, subcontractors and sponsors<br>
    </strong>ManageMySpa may disclose your personal information to business       partners, subcontractors or sponsors as SumTotal deems necessary to       provide products and services to you. Many promotions give you the chance       to request additional information from the sponsors. When you ask for more       information, you give ManageMySpa permission to send your personal       information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. If you do not       want any personal information to be shared with our business partners or       sponsors, you may opt out by sending an email to privacy@ managemyspa.com &nbsp;with "OPT OUT" in the subject       line. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>ManageMySpa       International Locations<br>
    </strong>ManageMySpa maintains offices in many areas around the world. To       better serve you, the information you provide may be accessed by ManageMySpa       employees worldwide. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Third-party       data and aggregate data<br>
    </strong>ManageMySpa discloses aggregated or anonymous statistics to prospective       partners and advertisers and for other lawful purposes.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Other       situations<br>
    </strong>ManageMySpa also may disclose your information where disclosure is       necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who       may be causing injury to or interfering with our rights or property       rights, the users' rights, or others’ rights. In the same way, ManageMySpa       will disclose information when we reasonably believe disclosure is       required by law or to comply with a legal process served on ManageMySpa.       We may also disclose your personal information in the good faith belief       that we must act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal       safety of users of the ManageMySpa Site, or the public.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>Do I have a choice about how my information is gathered,  used and distributed?</strong></h3>
  <p>    Yes. When you log in or register with ManageMySpa, you can  choose to receive newsletters, information, and e-mails from ManageMySpa and  third parties. If you change your mind, you can simply update your account  information on our Web site so that the information will not be sent. It's your  choice.</p>
  <p> Some of our promotions may request your e-mail address so  that you can receive periodic updates about the status of the promotion. When  you participate in these types of promotions, you will automatically receive  promotion-related e-mail; however, you can choose the no-e-mail option that  some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion-related e-mail messages may  include targeted advertisements.</p>
  <p> While using our hosting services, you may choose to store  personal information on our servers through such services. The storage and  removal of such information is at your discretion.</p>
  <h3> <strong>What security precautions does ManageMySpa take to  protect me?</strong></h3>
  <p>    We have security measures in place to protect your personal  information, including the use of industry-standard encryption technology and  internal policies and restrictions regarding the storage of and access to your  personal information.</p>
  <p> Your ManageMySpa account information and profile are  password-protected so that you are the only one who has access to your personal  information. You can edit your account information and profile by using your  logon name and password. We recommend that you follow these guidelines to  protect yourself: </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Do not       tell anyone your password. If your password has been compromised for any       reason, you should immediately change your password. </li>
    <li>Do not       respond to unsolicited e-mail by giving your password, even if the e-mail       claims to be from us. ManageMySpa will never ask you for your password in       this way. </li>
    <li>When       you are done using the ManageMySpa site, sign out of your account and       close your browser window. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to  be 100% secure. Although we are committed to protecting your personal  information, ManageMySpa cannot ensure or warrant the security of any  information you send to us or from our online services. Providing personal  information to ManageMySpa is done at your own risk.</p>
  <h3> <strong>What are cookies and how does ManageMySpa use them?</strong></h3>
  <p>    Part of our customized service involves using “cookies” so  that we can immediately recognize you, determine when you – or someone using  the same browser you previously used – revisits ManageMySpa, and to provide a  more personalized experience. A "cookie" is a chunk of data that is  sent to your browser from a web server and stored by your browser on the hard  drive of your computer. Your browser settings must be set to accept cookies  before you can login or customize. Most browsers are set up to accept cookies,  but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse them. ManageMySpa  does not use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your  computer. This policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers on  the ManageMySpa Site.</p>
  <p> ManageMySpa uses cookies to: </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Locate       your name and account information when you log in to our Web site so that       you can access your account information. When you log in, the cookie is       set, and when you sign-out, the cookie is modified. </li>
    <li>Estimate       the size of our audience. Each browser that accesses ManageMySpa is given       a unique cookie, which is used to calculate how many people return to our       Web site, compare the number of registered and unregistered visitors to       our site, and use customer interests and behavior to target our advertisements. </li>
    <li>Help ManageMySpa       partners track visits and complete business transactions. This information       is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail". </li>
    <li>Track       the way you use our promotions, contests, and sales. When a ManageMySpa hosted       promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie tracks the       user's progress through the promotion (for example, entries, submissions,       and status in prize drawings). </li>
    <li>Measure       the traffic to various areas of the ManageMySpa Site. We measure the areas       of the network of Web sites you visit and your visiting patterns in the       aggregate. This research helps us understand the ways in which our       customers are alike and the ways in which they differ. We may use this       information to personalize the information and design in our Web site. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can make decisions about cookies. You can modify your  browser preferences to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or  to reject all cookies. If you decide to reject all cookies, you might not be  able to access certain areas of the ManageMySpa website or participate in ManageMySpa  services that require registration to participate..</p>
