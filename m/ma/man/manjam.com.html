											Conditions, then You SHOULD NOT register as a Member.</p>

										</p>
										<p>2.1 As a Member, You can take advantage of many services on the Site for free.

										</p>
										<p>2.2 Member subscription payments can be made in UK Sterling or Dollars.
										</p>
										<p>2.3 Please note that any Member subscription paid by You is subject to a minimum 
											contractual period of one month.

											Our right to suspend or terminate Your Membership to this Site immediately and 
											without notice.
										</p>
										<p><strong>4. Password Member Name and Security</strong>
										</p>

											someone else.
										</p>
										<p>4.3 You agree to notify Us immediately of any unauthorized use of Your Password 
											or Member Name or any other breach of security of which You become aware.

											You or Your violation of any law or the rights of any third party.
										</p>
										<p><strong>6. Acceptable Use</strong>
										</p>
										<p>6.1 We support the free flow of information and ideas over the Internet and do 
											not actively monitor use of the Site, including the Members' area under normal 
											circumstances. We seek to balance this aim with Our obligations to other 
											Members and at law however. We do therefore review all information entered onto 
											the Site by Members, check instant messages where certain keywords are 
											triggered and log chatroom exchanges in order to ensure compliance with these 
											terms, and to comply with or investigate any enforcement agency or police 
											request or complaints. We also therefore require that You do not:
										</p>
										<p>6.1.1 say or do anything that would cause annoyance, inconvenience, harassment 
											or needless anxiety to others;
										</p>
										<p>6.1.2 advertise or promote any third party or Your own products or services by 
											way of the distribution of 'spam' email, instant messages and/or chat room

										</p>
										<p>6.1.5 jump in and out of Site forum rooms ("frogging");
										</p>
										<p>6.1.6 distribute illegal, copyright infringing, indecent or offensive material 
											or any messages or content that may incite disorder or encourage illegal 
											activities or that causes or may cause harm to minors;
										</p>
										<p>6.1.7 impersonate another person or Member;
										</p>
										<p>6.1.8 transfer files that contain viruses, trojans or other harmful programs;
										</p>
										<p>6.1.9 use the Site to conduct any fraudulent activity including any "pyramid 
											scheme"; "ponzi scheme" or "chain letter";
										</p>
										<p>6.1.10 access or attempt to access the accounts of other Members or to penetrate 
											or attempt to penetrate the Site security measures;
										</p>
										<p>6.1.11 have more than one Member Account at any time.
										</p>
										<p>6.2 We may take any or all of the following action at Our discretion:
										</p>
										<p>6.2.1 remove any Member profile (including photographs) or other material that, 
											in Our sole discretion may be inappropriate or We suspect to be illegal, 
											subject Us to liability or which may violate these Membership Terms and 
											Conditions or where required to do so by law;
										</p>
										<p>6.2.2 issue Members with verbal or written warnings and may take such further 
											action as We deem appropriate under this paragraph 6.2 if such warnings are not

											suspected illegal activity.
										</p>
										<p>We will determine what action is appropriate to be taken against a Member on a 
											case by case basis.
										</p>
										<p>6.3 You acknowledge that We may be required by law or regulation to access, 
											monitor, store or copy material sent by or to Members without further notice to 
											You.
										</p>
										<p><strong>7. Cancellation</strong>
										</p>
										<p>7.1 Your Membership services commence immediately when You submit Your 
											registration, or subscription. This means that, subject always to Your right to 
											terminate as set out below, You will not be able to cancel the services after 
											this point.
										</p>
										<p><strong>8.Termination of Membership</strong>
										</p>
										<p>8.1 Subject to paragraph 8.2 below, You can terminate Your Membership at any 
											time by notifying Us.
										</p>

										</p>
										<p>8.3 No refunds will be paid by Us where Your Membership is terminated by Us as a 
											consequence of Your breach of these Membership Terms and Conditions.

											attributable to Our negligence. Where We are liable for direct loss this will 
											be limited to a maximum of the total price of the Member Subscription paid to 
											Us by You in the 6 months prior to the claim.
										</p>
										<p>10.6 Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall exclude or limit Our liability 
											for death or personal injury caused by Our negligence.

										<p class="textHeading1">Your Privacy</p>
										<p><strong>Privacy Policy&nbsp;</strong>We at HubJet LLC, ("we" or "HubJet") have 
											created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting 
											your personal information and informing you about how we handle it. This 
											privacy policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, 
											and data gathered, on this Website and and double blind email communications 
											between members (collectively, the "Site") but does not apply to any other 
											Website or offline point of contact between HubJet, or any other company, and 
											consumers. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it 
											from time to time. This privacy policy was last revised on December 30, 2005. 
											Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by doing so you 
											are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.</p>
										<p><strong>Your IP Address&nbsp;</strong>Like most e-commerce Websites, each time 
											you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page 
											from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the Site for you and 
											to diagnose problems with our Site, we use your IP address to help identify you 
											and to gather broad demographic information about you.</p>
										<p><strong>Cookies&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Like most Websites, the Site uses cookies to 
											keep track of your purchases and other activity on the Site and enhance your 
											experience on the Site. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your 
											interests, to save your password, and if you choose, to save other personal and 
											financial information so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the 
											Site. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on 
											your browser. If you wish to disable these cookies, the "help" portion of the 
											toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to 
											disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas on the Site.</p>
										<p><strong>Information We Collect From You&nbsp;</strong>In order to operate the 
											Site and to provide you with information about products or services that may be 
											of interest to you, we may collect "personal information" (i.e. information 
											that could be used to contact you directly (without using the Site) such as 
											full name, postal address, phone number or email address), "financial 
											information" (i.e. credit card numbers or passwords) or "demographic 
											information" (i.e. information that you submit, or that we collect, that is 
											neither personal information nor financial information; this may include, but 
											is not limited to, zip code, postal code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth 
											date, purchase history information, browsing history information, searching 
											history information, registration history information, and the content of 
											communications between you and other members over the Site), subject to the 
											rest of this paragraph. Demographic information is divided into two categories: 
											1) "non-public information", which consists of purchase history information and 
											one-on-one communications between you and other users of the Site; and 2) 
											"public information", which consists of all other demographic information. We 
											ask that you do not enter personal information or financial information into 
											your “Profile” (for example, don’t use your address or postcode as your 
											username, or include your name or address in your written responses), because 
											if you do then it may be posted publicly on the Site, and the information will 
											then be treated as "demographic information" that is "public information." 
											Please note that nowhere on the Site do we knowingly collect personal 
											information from children under the age of 18, as we require that all users 
											represent to us that they are at least 18 years old.</p>
										<p><strong>Information Other Websites Collect From You&nbsp;</strong>On the Site, 
											we place links to other Websites operated by other parties. Some of these other 
											Websites contain our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property 
											that we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit these other 
											Websites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand names, trademarks 
											and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that we do not control 
											these other Websites or these other Websites’ business practices, and that this 
											privacy policy does not apply to these other Websites. Consequently, the 
											operators of these other Websites may collect different kinds of information 
											about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we 
											would if it were collected on the Site. We encourage you to review their 
											privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their 
											actions.</p>
										<p><strong>How We Use Personal Information&nbsp;</strong>We use your email address 
											and your other personal information to help us efficiently operate the Site, to 
											contact you in connection with your transactions and other activities on the 
											Site (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails or important news that 
											could affect your relationship with HubJet), and to forward messages to you 
											from other users. These types of communications are known as "Operational 
											Communications." In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain 
											commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers.</p>
										<p>We also use personal information to send you newsletters, information, offers 
											and other promotional materials for HubJet’s or third parties’ goods or 
											services. We attempt to send you offers that are of value to you, such as 
											discounts, exclusive offers or special event information. The Site provides you 
											with options to decline to receive communications from HubJet (other than those 
											contained in Operational Communications). Some of these options may only be for 
											a certain category of communications; others may be more general. By posting a 
											profile on the Site, you are opting in to receive services by email. To stop 
											receiving services by Mail, go to the "My Email Alerts" section of your account 
											settings and change the desired options.</p>
										<p>To operate the Site, including processing your transactions and supporting your 
											activities on the Site, we may share your personal information with our agents, 
											representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with 
											support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, email 
											origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management 
											services, order fulfilment and sweepstakes and promotional fulfilment. We 
											require these entities not to use your information for any other purpose.</p>
										<p>By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services 
											offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, or electing to receive 
											communications (such as emails or magazine subscriptions) or electing to 
											participate in contests, sweepstakes or other programs (such as discount or 
											rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, you 
											consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties. 
											Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their 
											own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct

											information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all 
											such information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which 
											we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us.</p>
										<p>In some cases, we may enter into a promotional relationship with another company 
											in which we prominently display their brand name or trademarks on pages of the 
											Site. These pages are known as "Co-Branded Pages" and these companies are known 
											as “Co-Branded Companies.” If the page on which you submit information is a 
											Co-Branded Page, or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, 
											then we may share your personal information with the associated Co-Branded 
											Company. Co-Branded Companies may use your personal information in accordance

											to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your 
											personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and

											same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information 
											you submit to us. Some Co-Branded Pages may contain an action tag (also known 
											as a Web Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file) that a third party may use to read 
											cookies that it, or its clients, may have placed on your browser at other 
											Websites before your visit to this Website. This technology is used to measure 
											the effectiveness of advertisements on such other Websites that promote 
											Co-Branded Pages. Other third parties may use the information collected through 
											this technology to learn more about your visits to this Site and other Websites 
											in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 
											We have been informed by a third party that unless you are otherwise notified, 
											they do not use your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number, and do 
											not link your online actions to any information that can be used to identify or 
											contact you. However, as we may not verify that this is the case, we ask that 
											you seek a third parties assurance yourself and do not hold us accountable for 
											the accuracy of the above statement.</p>
										<p>Any third party with whom we are allowed to share your personal information is 
											authorized to use your personal information in accordance with our contractual 
											arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy 
											policies, over which we have no control, and you agree that we are not 
											responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact 
											you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for 
											the use of your personal information by them.</p>
										<p>Please read the information below under the heading "Special Cases in which we 
											Share Personal and Financial Information" to learn more ways in which we may 
											share your personal information.</p>
										<p><strong>How We Use Financial Information</strong> We use your financial 
											information to check your qualifications, to bill you for products and services 
											and to enable you to participate in discount, rebate and similar programs in 
											which you may elect to participate. By making a purchase, or engaging in any 
											other kind of activity or transaction that uses financial information, on the 
											Site, you consent to our providing your financial information to our service 
											providers and to such third parties as we determine are necessary to support 
											and process your activities and transactions, as well as to your credit card 
											issuer for their purposes. These third parties may include the credit card 
											companies and banking institutions used to process and support the transaction 
											or activity. By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products 
											or services of third parties offered on the Site, or by participating in 
											programs offered on the Site that are administered by third parties and that 
											require you to submit financial information in order to use them, you also 
											consent to our providing your financial information to those third parties. 
											Additionally, if the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, 
											or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share 
											your financial information with the associated Co-Branded Company. Any of these 
											various third parties (including Co-Branded Companies) may be authorized to use 
											your financial information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with 
											such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over 
											which we have no control, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable 
											for any of their actions or omissions. Additionally, you agree that we may use 
											and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the 
											same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information 
											that you submit to us. Please read the information below under the heading 
											"Special Cases in which we Share Personal and Financial Information" to learn 
											more ways in which we may share your financial information.
										</p>
										<p><strong>Special Cases in which we Share Personal and Financial Information&nbsp;</strong>Your 
											personal information or financial information may be passed on to a third party 
											in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy. We may also 
											disclose personal information or financial information when we determine that 
											such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with 
											law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of members or other 
											visitors to the Site. We also may disclose your personal information or 
											financial information to our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, 
											and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with who we are under common 
											corporate control. Whenever personal information or financial information is 
											disclosed under this paragraph, we may also disclose your demographic 
											information along with it, on a non-anonymous basis. All of our parent, 
											subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive your 
											personal information, financial information, or non-anonymous demographic 
											information from us will comply with the terms of this privacy policy with 
											respect to their use and disclosure of such information.</p>
										<p><strong>How We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information&nbsp;</strong>We 
											may review all demographic information. We may use public information to enable 
											other users to find your profile and to communicate with you. We may use 
											demographic information to tailor the Site and communications to your 
											interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an 
											anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your 
											identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that 
											our advertisers’ goods and services will appeal to members, so that we may 
											target specific ads at specific demographic groups. Our sharing of demographic 
											information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell advertisers 
											which particular users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the 
											rest of this privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we 
											ask you to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and 
											you decide to give the advertiser your personal information, then the 
											advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic 
											group. Please also be aware that when we disclose your financial information or 
											personal information to a Co-Branded Company, as described above, we may also 
											disclose to that Co-Branded Company your demographic information, other than 
											the content of one-on-one communications between you and other members. Please 
											also be aware that we may disclose your demographic information on a 
											non-anonymous basis as described above in the paragraph titled "Special Cases 
											in which we Share Personal and Financial Information." Also, to read further 
											details about how we may use your public information, see our Terms of Use.</p>
										<p><strong>Our Security Precautions&nbsp;</strong>The Site has security measures in 
											place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information 
											under our control. Our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard 
											and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. 
											We encrypt all of your personal and financial information as it travels over 
											the Internet and we store your financial information on our servers in 
											encrypted form. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on 
											computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country 
											or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and the country or 
											jurisdiction in which these computer networks are located may not have privacy 
											laws as protective as the laws in your country or jurisdiction.</p>
										<p><strong>Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information&nbsp;</strong>If 
											at any point we decide to use particular personally identifiable information in 
											a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will 
											notify users by way of an email or by providing 30 days notice on the Site. 
											Please note that we will continue to have the right to change our privacy 
											policy and practices, and how we use your personally identifiable information, 
											without notice, as described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, 
											provided that such changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after 
											the date of the change.</p>
										<p><strong>How You Can Access and Update Your Email Preferences, Personal Information 
												and Public Information&nbsp;</strong>We give you the opportunity to opt-out 
											of certain communications and modify personal information or demographic 
											information you have provided to us, and to hide demographic information from, 
											or make demographic information visible to, the public users of the Site, at 
											anytime by going to the Account Settings or My Profile section of the Site. 
											Please be aware that it may take several hours for the changes you make to take 
											effect on the public areas of the Site. We thank you for your patience. Please 
											note that changing or deleting your information through the "Account Settings" 
											or "My Profile" section of the Site, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of 
											email communications from HubJet, will only change or delete the data in our 
											database for purposes of future activities on the Site and for managing future 
											communications from HubJet. These changes and deletions will not change or 
											delete emails or information that we may have already forwarded to other users 
											or credit card companies or any other third parties, all as provided above in 
											this privacy policy.</p>
