<br><br>

<br><br>
Information collected from third party services for which you provide 89n with API access credentials. These services include Twitter, Facebook and Google+.

<br><br>
<b>Electronic newsletters policy</b>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>Children</b>

In order to use ManageFlitter, users must have a valid Twitter account.
<br><br>
<b>Usage tracking</b>
<br><br>
89n tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. 89n does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
<br><br>
89n sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b>
<br><br>
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 89n uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.
<br><br>
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do need cookies in order to use most of the functionality on this site.
<br><br>
<b>USE OF INFORMATION</b>
<br><br>
89n uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.
<br><br>
As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. 89n never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.
<br><br>
When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users.
89n creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We may also disclose information about any individual user to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
<br><br>
<b>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</b>
<br><br>
89n uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We will not share any previously private information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
<br><br>
<b>SECURITY</b>
<br><br>
89n operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.
<br><br>
<b>OPT-OUT POLICY</b>
<br><br>
We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:
<br><br>
Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.
<br><br>
Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users
<br><br>
You may contact us to have information we have cached about your from third party services removed from our system.
<br><br>
<b>YOUR CONSENT</b>
