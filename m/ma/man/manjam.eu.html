If you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their Profile information from Manjam. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new Profile.

If any of the individuals you have invited do not register within a few days, Manjam may occasionally send reminder emails to those individuals. Please remember you must not invite any children to join. You are responsible for ensuring that your friend has agreed to receiving a Manjam invite.
