					<h4>Privacy Policy</h4><br>
					<p><strong>Manexa Privacy Statement: </strong><br>
Manexa has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to  demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the Manexa web site  (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather important  information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement  as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination  practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide  notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the  change taking effect. </p>
<p>
<strong>Collected Information:</strong> <br>
We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site  (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information, such as  their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and  financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and  address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization  that will be using the Service. At the time you express interest in attaining  additional information, or when you register for the Service, we may also ask  for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax  number, or additional company information, such as number of employees, or industry.  Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering  it when asked. Customers can update or remove their personal information at any  time by logging into the Website and editing their Personal Information within  the System Administrative Tab. Customers can view their updated profile to  confirm their edits have been made. </p>
<p>
Manexa uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for  individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact  customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Service that  we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as  promotions and events. All Customers must designate an administrator of the  site and provide an email address for that person to <a href="mailto:admin@baralliance.com">admin@Manexa.com</a>. Customer email  addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or  shared with third parties. We may also email information regarding updates to  the Service or company. Again, email will not be distributed or shared and  customers can opt out of receiving any communication by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@baralliance.com">admin@Manexa.com</a> at the time it is  distributed. </p>
<p>
Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as  provided for in the Master Subscription Agreement, we do not disclose to third  parties the information provided. All financial and billing information that we  collect through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of  prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This billing information is  not used by Manexa for marketing or promotional purposes. Manexa uses a  third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary  is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store,  retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit  card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide  content on the web Site but they are not permitted to collect any information  nor does Manexa share user information with these parties. </p>

<p>
Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information  ("Data"). Manexa will not review, share, distribute, print, or  reference any such Data except as provided in the Manexa Master Subscription  Agreement, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be  viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue,  or suspected violation of the Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be  required by law.

<p>
<strong>Cookies: </strong><br>
When you interact with the Manexa Website we strive to make that experience  easy and meaningful. When you come to our Web site, our Web server sends a  cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a  computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors  have visited the Site previously. <br>
</p><p>
Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize  your browser. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based.  Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your  computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.  Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or  turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier  for your browser. </p>
<p>
Manexa uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the  system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information  allows Manexa to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies  help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are  required in order to use the Manexa application. Manexa uses persistent cookies  that only Manexa can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a Manexa  customer or prior Manexa Website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are  especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information  stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or  passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability  to accept cookies will be able to browse our Website but will not be able to  successfully use our Service. </p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Cookies:</strong> <br>
We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze  non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from  visitors to our website to help us administer our website and improve its  quality. Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior.  Such cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any  personally identifiable information. All data collected by such third parties  on behalf of Manexa is used only to provide us with information on site usage  and is not shared with any other third parties. </p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Sites:</strong> <br>
The Site contains links to other web sites. Manexa is not responsible for the  privacy practices or the content of these other web sites. Customers and  visitors will need to check the policy statement of these others web sites to  understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may  be disclosing their private information. It is the responsibility of the user  to keep such information private and confidential. </p>
<p>
<strong>Security:</strong> <br>
Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss,  misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Site is accessed  using Netscape Navigator, or Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.5 or  higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both  server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data is safe,  secure, and available only to you. Manexa also implements an advanced security  method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the  Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced  technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Manexa  provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a  customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain  data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.</p>
