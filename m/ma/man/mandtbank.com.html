                such as data processing and collections, or in otherwise managing 
                our business. Also, we may partner with other financial institutions 
                to offer, endorse or sponsor financial products or services jointly, 
                as we do with the M&amp;T Bank VISA</font><font face="Symbol">Ã’</font><font face="Arial"> 
                card (for which we partner with MBNA - one of the nationâ€™s largest 
                credit card issuers). Other examples include our relationships 
                with mortgage brokers and insurance agents. And sometimes we select 
                companies to provide you with products and services we donâ€™t offer 
                ourselves - products and services we believe are of value, such 
                as credit insurance. In all the situations referenced here, we 
                share the information we obtain about you (as described previously) 
                only to the extent necessary to allow these companies to perform 
                services for us, or to provide you with products or services.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">We are extremely selective when choosing outside 
                companies to become our partners. We realize that itâ€™s our relationship 
                with you thatâ€™s on the line - not theirs. So we require them to 
                conform to our own strict confidentiality and privacy standards. 
                An outside company is never allowed to sell your information, 
                or to use it for any purpose other than providing the specific 
                product or service we intended the company to provide.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">In addition to sharing information with the 
                outside companies we choose to work with, we may also share information 
                with reputable consumer reporting agencies such as Experian, Trans 
                Union or Equifax. And we may be obligated by law to disclose information 
                under court orders or subpoenas or, in some cases, to other governmental 
                agencies (such as the IRS for interest reporting).</font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial">At M&amp;T, we understand how important it 
                is to protect your personal and financial information. Thatâ€™s 
                why we have in place physical, electronic and procedural safeguards 
                that meet federal standards.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Within M&amp;T, we educate our employees about 
                the importance of confidentiality and privacy, and we train them 
                in related policies and procedures. We also take appropriate disciplinary

              <p><font face="Arial">Due to the unique nature of Internet transactions,

                Protect Yourself</font></b></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Because we value your trust, we have implemented 
                the policies and procedures described here to safeguard your accounts 
                and your personal and financial information. But there are also 
                a few simple steps that you can take to protect yourself:</font></p>
              <ul>
                <li><font face="Arial">Never disclose personal information, such 
                  as your Social Security number, credit card number, bank account 
                  number or personal identification number to anyone who should 
                  not have access to your accounts. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial">Report lost or stolen checks or bank cards 
                  immediately. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial">Memorize your personal identification number 
                  â€“ donâ€™t carry it in your wallet. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial">Review monthly financial statements promptly 
                  and report any discrepancies. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial">Retain all receipts from ATM, debit and 
                  credit card transactions. When youâ€™re ready to dispose of them, 
                  make sure your account number is not readable. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial">Be sure to sign new bank cards immediately. 
                  </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial">Report unusual telephone inquiries or other 
                  suspicious activity to your telephone company or local law enforcement 
                  authorities. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial">If you believe you have been a victim of 
                  fraud related to your M&amp;T accounts, notify us immediately, 
                  so that we can take action to help you. You should also report 
                  the crime to your local law enforcement agency and to the Federal 
                  Trade Commission (FTC). You can reach the FTC at 1-877-438-4338

              <p><font face="Arial">At M&amp;T, we believe that one of the ways 
                we can meet your needs is by making you aware of products and 
                services we offer, endorse or sponsor that may help you achieve 
                your financial goals. So we do our best to let you know about 
                them. If we canâ€™t do so in person, we (or our product and service 
                partners) may send you a letter or an e-mail, or perhaps even 
                call you from time to time. You may have a preference about how 
                we contact you about special offers and information that may be 
                beneficial to you. If so, just let us know at any time, and we 
                will honor your request.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Of course, we know that you probably also 
                receive mail and phone calls from other companies, many of whom 
                you or we donâ€™t do business with. What you may not know is that 
                you can limit the solicitations you receive from these other companies 
                if they are members of the Direct Marketing Association. To reduce 
                the number of mail and telephone solicitations you receive from

                However, you can also choose to limit information that is shared 
                within the M&amp;T family of companies and/or outside it, except

              <p><font face="Arial">But if you prefer, you can direct us not to 
                share certain information within the M&amp;T family of companies 
                - namely credit-related information from other financial institutions 
                or information that you have provided to us - and we will honor 
                your request. Please note that if you exercise this option, we 
                may still share some information within the M&amp;T family, but 
                only to the extent allowed by law, such as that which relates

              <p><font face="Arial">If youâ€™d like to limit the amount of your 
                information shared within the M&amp;T family and/or with outside

                sharing into effect. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">When we receive your request, we will process 
                it promptly. Please note that at the time you make your request, 
                programs that involve information sharing may already be underway, 
                but your name will be removed from such programs in the future. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">You can exercise your option to limit information 
                sharing at any time, and you only need to do so once, regardless 
                of the number of accounts you have with us. Your decision to do 
                so will be honored for as long as you have any accounts with any 
                of the companies within the M&amp;T family - and even after you 
                close your accounts with us - unless you advise us in writing 
                to remove the limitations. (Please note that this policy, including 
                sections relating to information that we share, applies to former 
                customers to the same extent as existing customers.) </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">If you choose to limit information sharing, 
                it will apply only to your personal accounts at M&amp;T. If you 
                own an M&amp;T account jointly with another person, you or any 
                of the other joint account owners can direct us to limit the sharing 
                of information relative to that account. The joint account owner 
                who directs us to do so will automatically have that limitation 
                applied to all M&amp;T accounts he or she owns. If the other joint 
                account owner(s) wish to limit information sharing on their other 
                M&amp;T accounts, they need to contact us individually with that 
                request. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">This policy is effective as of July 1, 2001. 
                Until then, current policies and practices remain in effect. This 
                policy replaces all previous versions, and it supersedes anything 
                to the contrary in your account documentation from any of the 
                companies within the M&amp;T family. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">We hope this insight as to how M&amp;T uses
