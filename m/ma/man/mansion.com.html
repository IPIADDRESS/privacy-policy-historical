<p><b>Introduction</b>
</p><p>Mansion.com is the homepage of the Mansion Group, responsible for some of the finest online casino brands in the world (referred to as MANSION.COM, “we”, “our” or “us” as the context requires).</p>
<p>We have provided this privacy policy to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard your information for the purpose of operating our online casino and poker services. You should read this notice in conjunction with our <a href="http://www.mansion.com/terms-and-conditions/">terms and conditions</a> for use of this site or any other sites operated by us.</p>

<p><b>Personal information</b>
</p><p>We collect personal information when you use our online gambling services, make customer enquiries, register for information or other services, or when you respond to us. Selected third parties, to whom you have chosen to disclose your personal information, may also provide us with your personal information. The types of personal information we may collect could include, for example, your name and e-mail address, home address, telephone number, debit/credit card data and lifestyle and other information collected on registration or through online surveys or questionnaires.</p>

<p><b>How your information is processed</b>
</p><p>If you choose to provide us with personal information, your personal information will be processed to allow us to provide you with online gambling services; process any of your requests for information; provide customer support services; enable the depositing and withdrawal of funds via payment settlement service providers; market our services or products or those of the Group; improve the content of our website; notify you about updates to our website, software and/or services; and support any of the intended purposes stated at the time at which your information was collected, in accordance with your preferences.</p>
<p>We may publicise any major winnings earned by you by simply giving your username, country of origin, amount of winning and associated game - whereby you agree to this limited use of your details for this sole purpose, unless you otherwise contact us to revoke such implied consent.</p>

<p><b>To whom your information is disclosed ("recipients")</b>
</p><p>Our information may be disclosed for processing to any other companies within the Group and their employees; any third party service providers who use your personal information to provide services to us - such as: payment settlement service providers, marketing service providers (including affiliates), data verifiers and financial institutions, to the extent necessary for the completion of payments, joint marketing campaigns, facilitate the opening of new accounts, and fraud prevention for services provided through our website; or any auditors or contractors or other advisers auditing any of the Group's business processes, potential purchasers or investors in any company within the Group. Any processing performed by any recipients will be governed by the necessary data processing agreement in the form and substance required by applicable law, thereby preserving your rights under applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>We ensure that your information will not be disclosed to government institutions or authorities unless:</p>
<ul>
	<li>we have your written consent to share such personally identifiable information with third parties;</li>
	<li>we require your personally identifiable information to provide the services that you have requested (if any)</li>
	<li>we respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process;</li>
	<li>we find that your actions on our web sites violate our terms of service, or any of our usage guidelines for specific services.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we reserve the right to disclose and transfer your personal data to our respective payment settlement service providers and financial institutions to the extent necessary for the completion of payments for services provided through our website.</p>

<p><b>Security</b>
</p><p>Keeping your data safe is our paramount concern.</p>
<p>Internal access to all data is limited and strictly monitored. We have implemented suitable security policies, rules and technical measures to protect and safeguard the personal data under our control from unauthorised access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss.</p>
<p>All our employees and data processors or handlers who have access to, and are associated with the processing of your personal information, are obliged to respect the confidential nature of your information pursuant to applicable data protection and privacy laws.</p>

We reserve the right to amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and in response to changes in applicable data protection and privacy legislation applicable to the Group. By submitting your personally identifiable information to us you consent to the use of that information as set out in this Privacy Policy. If we change our Privacy Policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times.
