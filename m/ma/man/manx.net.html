<h3>4. IP Addresses</h3>
<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where
available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for
system administration and to report aggregate information to our
advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing
actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
<h3>5. Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on
your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree.
Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's
hard drive.</p>
<p>Each of Our Websites uses cookies from time to time to
distinguish you from other users of each of Our Websites. This
helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse each
of Our Websites and also allows us to improve each of Our
Websites.</p>
<p>For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes
for which we use them see our <a href="/terms-and-conditions/cookie-policy.aspx">Cookie
Policy</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Where we store your personal data</h3>
<p>The data that we collect from you will be transferred to, and
stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Also it will be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who
work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged
in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the
processing of your payment details and the provision of support
services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this
transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably
necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in
accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure
servers and will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have
given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you
to access certain parts of any of Our Websites, you are responsible
for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a
password with anyone.</p>
<p>In order to be able to read SSL encrypted messages you will need
Netscape version 4.05 or Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers,
version 4 or above.</p>
<p>If you are required to send us your credit or debit card
information, your details will be encrypted twice - once before
transmission then again by the secure connection during
transmission.</p>
<p>All credit and debit card details are stored in encrypted form
on our servers and can only be viewed by employees with the
appropriate level of security clearance. In addition to the steps
that we take to protect your personal data, you should take the
following steps to help protect yourself against Internet
fraud:</p>
<ul>
<li>choose a password you can remember but others will not guess,
and if you do write it down, keep it somewhere safe and
secure;</li>
<li>when you have finished any session on any of Our Websites, make
sure that you prevent your details being seen by any third parties
and, if you have registered and logged in, remember to log
off;</li>
<li>clear any 'cache' so there is no record of any transactions
left on screen; and</li>
<li>close your browser so any history of the session is
cleared.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet
is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect
your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data
transmitted to any of Our Websites; any transmission is at your own
risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict
procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised
access.</p>
      
<h3>7. Uses made of the information</h3>
<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>to ensure that content from each of Our Websites is presented
in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;</li>
<li>to send you messages about your account or to provide you with
information, products or services that you request from us or which
we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted
for such purposes;</li>
<li>to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered
into between you and us;</li>
<li>to allow you to participate in interactive features of our
service, when you choose to do so; and</li>
<li>to notify you about changes to our service.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to
use your data, to provide you with information about goods and
services which may be of interest to you and we or they may contact
you about these by post or telephone.</p>
<p>If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by
electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and
services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale
to you.</p>
<p>If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third
parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by
electronic means only if you have consented to this.</p>
<p>If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass
your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>please tick the relevant box situated on the form on which we
collect your data (the order form); or</li>
<li>by contacting our Customer Services department by telephone
(+44 1624 624624) or by email <strong><a href="mailto:customer@manxtelecom.com">customer@manxtelecom.com</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to
our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information
about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged
under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We
may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach
the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in
IM1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from
you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by
displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
<h3>8. Disclosure of your information</h3>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our
group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company
and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 220 of the Isle of Man
Companies Act 2006 (as amended). We may disclose your personal
information to third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in
which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective
seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li>
<li>if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a
third party, in which case personal data held by it about its
customers will be one of the transferred assets; and</li>
<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data
in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to
enforce or apply our <a href="/terms-and-conditions/website-terms-of-use.aspx">Website Terms of
Use</a> or our <a href="/terms-and-conditions/consumer.aspx">Terms and Conditions of
Supply</a> and other agreements; or to protect the rights,
property, or safety of Manx Telecom Limited, our customers, our
suppliers or other third parties. This includes exchanging
information with other companies and organisations for the purposes
of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ul>
      
<h3>9. Your rights</h3>
<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data
for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before
collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such
purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third
party for such purposes.</p>
<p>You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by
checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your
data.</p>

liability for these policies. Please check these policies before
