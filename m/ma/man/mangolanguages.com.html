<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p align="justify">      Creative 
Empire, LLC d/b/a Mango Languages (“Mango”, “we” or “us”) 
is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy tells you 
about our online collection and use of data. We feel it is important 
that you fully understand the terms and conditions under which we use 
the information we gather from you through the use of our Web site located 
at, or linked to, the URL <a href="http://www.mangolanguages.com/" target="_blank"><u>www.mangolanguages.com</u></a> (the "Site"). Please read this 
privacy policy ("Policy") carefully to understand how we will 
use and protect your personal information. We will not share your personal 
information with anyone except as described in this policy.</p>

<p align="justify">      By 
using this site, you understand and agree to the terms of this policy. 
The Site is owned by Mango and may be accessed in the United States 
and abroad. For data protection purposes, Mango is the controller and, 
unless otherwise noted, is also the processor of data. Information collected 
may be stored, processed, accessed, and used in jurisdictions whose 
privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your 
home jurisdiction.  <br></p>
<p align="justify"><b>1. 
 What information does Mango collect from or about you? </b> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      When 
you visit the Site, certain kinds of information, such as your IP address, 
browser type and language, and access times, may be collected automatically 
as part of the Site’s operation. We also may collect navigational 
information, including information about the pages you view, the links 
you click, and other actions taken in connection with the site.  <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      We 
may combine your visit and navigational information with personal information 
that you provide. You may always choose not to provide personal information, 
but if you so choose, certain products and services may not be available 
to you. Personal information (e.g., your first name, nickname, email, 
password and Country location) is collected when you register. Additional 
personal information (e.g., your credit card number and billing address) 
is collected to process transactions or to provide you with products 
and services.  <br></p>

<p align="justify"><b>2. Where do 
we collect information from you and how do we use it?</b> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      Our 
primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide our visitors 
with a superior customized online experience. Among other things, we 
use customer contact information to fill orders, contact prior purchasers 
to inform them of their order status, to send promotional emails, to 
operate and improve our Site, to provide customer service, to perform 
research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and 
technologies, and to display content that is customized to your interests 
and preferences. <br></p>
<p align="justify">      We 
also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send 
transaction-related communications such as welcome letters, billing 
reminders, and purchase confirmations. We may also send you surveys 
or marketing communications to inform you of new products or services 
or other information that may be of interest. If you do not wish to 
receive marketing communications, you may follow the “unsubscribe” 
instructions included within each email communication. Please keep in 
mind that, if you choose not to receive marketing communications, you 
will continue to receive transactional or account communications (e.g., 
confirmation emails and account balance statements). <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      In 
addition, we may perform statistical analyses of aggregate customer 
behavior. This allows us to measure relative customer interest in the 
various areas of each of our Site for product development purposes and 
to improve the design of our Site. Any information we collect is used 
for our own internal purposes to improve the content and navigation 
of our Site, to enhance users' experiences when visiting our Site, to 
customize the content and/or layout of our pages, and to provide the 
services required by an individual user. We may also use information 
to notify consumers about updates to our Site, to complete user initiated 
transactions, to trace false orders and to contact consumers directly, 
or through our third-party service partners, for marketing purposes. <br>

</p>
<p align="justify">      Personal 
information collected by Mango may be stored and processed in the United 
States or any other country in which Mango or its affiliates, subsidiaries 
or agents maintain facilities, and by using our sites or services, you 
consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 
Mango abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department 
of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from 
the European Union. If you would like to exercise any of your data protection 
rights (including the right to have your personal information deleted), 
please contact us using the “Contact Information” below. </p>
<p align="justify"> <br>
<b>3.  With whom do we share your information?</b> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      Except 
as otherwise stated in this Policy, we do not sell, trade or rent your 
Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site to others.  <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      We 
may share your personal information to third-party service providers 
who perform services on our behalf.  For example, we may hire other 
companies to handle the processing of payments, to provide data storage, 
to host websites, to fulfill orders and shipments, to assist in direct 
marketing, to conduct audits, etc. Those companies will be permitted 
to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service. 
They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information 
and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.  <br>

</p>
<p align="justify">      Information 
about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed 
as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of the company and/or its 
assets, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, 
or receivership, in which personal information would be transferred 
as one of the business assets of the company. We will notify you of 
such an occurrence as described in the “Policy Changes” section 
below.  <br></p>
<p align="justify">      We 
reserve the right to disclose your personal information if required 
to do so by law to the appropriate governmental authorities, or in the 
good-faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply 
with legal process, respond to claims, or protect the rights, property 
or safety of our company, employees, customers, or the public.  
We will disclose your personal information upon receipt of a court order 
or subpoena or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We 
fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who 
use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report 
to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe 
to be unlawful. <br>
 <br>
<b>4.  How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information?</b> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      If 
you would like to review or revise information that you previously provided 
to us, you may access your information in the “My Account” section 
of the Site. A customer service representative can also assist you in 
making any changes, as well as in exercising your right to have your 
personal information corrected or deleted. If you need additional assistance, 
please contact us at <a href="mailto:sales@mangolanguage.com" target="_blank"><u>sales@mangolanguage.com</u></a>. You can expect a response from us within 
ten (10) calendar days. Please be advised that you cannot change your 
username without re-registering.  Please note, that because we 
keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated 
with past purchases. Note that we may retain changed or deleted information 
for archival or other purposes.  <br></p>
<p><b>5. What security precautions 
  are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your 
  information?</b></p>
<p align="justify">   The 
security of your personal information is of utmost important to us. 
We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your 
personal information. We employ reasonable security measures to protect 
the security of the information you submit to us. For instance, when 
you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our 
registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure 
socket layer (SSL) technology. Our secure servers protect this information 
using password protection and advanced encryption, and we may use firewall 
technology for additional protection. No method of transmission over 
the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, 
while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee 
its absolute security. <br></p>
<p align="justify">   If 
a password is used to protect your account and personal information, 
it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. </p>
<p align="justify"> <br>
<b>6.  Forums &amp; Other Interactive Services.</b>  <br>

</p>
<p align="justify">      Our 
Site may include discussion forums or other interactive areas or services, 
including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online 
hosting or storage services, or other areas or services in which you 
or third parties create, post or store any content, messages, comments, 
materials or other items on the sites (“Interactive Areas”). If 
you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware that these areas are 
open to the public and any personal information you post or provide 
at registration may be viewable by others. We are not responsible for 
personal information you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, 
nor are we responsible for how others might use that information, including 
sending you unsolicited messages. Interactive Area postings may be retained 
indefinitely. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please 
email us at <a href="mailto:sales@mangolanguages.com" target="_blank"><u>sales@mangolanguages.com</u></a>. Keep in mind that removal of a posting 
from an Interactive Area does not mean that the posting will be deleted 
from our systems.  <br></p>
<p align="justify"><b>7. Cookies/clear 
GIFs.</b> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Cookies:</b> 
Like many other commercial Site, our Site utilize standard technologies 
called "cookies" and clear GIFs to collect information about 
how each of our Site is used. A cookie is a small data text file, which 
a website stores on your computer's hard drive (if your web browser 
permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies 
were designed to help a website recognize a user's browser as a previous 
visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been 
set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by 
a website other than the one that set the cookie. Cookies can securely 
store a customer's password, personalize home pages, identify which 
parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections, such 
as those selected in a "shopping cart." For instance, cookies 
allow us to prepopulate (or fill in) an email field with your email 
address if you revisit one of our Site and place an order. A cookie 
cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer 
virus, or capture your email address. <br></p>

<p align="justify">      We 
send a cookie to your hard drive when you make an order to record the 
product name, category of product that you ordered, the amount paid, 
the order number and any referral codes. No Personally Identifiable 
Information is recorded. When you click through to any one of our Site 
from a promotional email, our third-party advertising service partner 
may send a cookie to your hard drive recording your IP address and other 
related information.  <br>
 <br>
<b>Clear GIFs:</b> At times, we work with third-party service partners 
that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, 
web beacons or action tags) for our benefit to help us measure advertising 
effectiveness. Clear GIFs help us better manage content on our Site 
by informing us of what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics 
with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used 
to track the online movements of our users. The main difference between 
the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, 
about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear GIFs 
are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information. <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      These 
third-party service partners use clear GIFs: (i) in HTML based emails 
to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients; (ii) to 
record when products have been ordered from our Site; and (iii) to track 
the visitor traffic on our Site. These clear GIFs allow us to measure 
the usage of each of our Site by our visitors and the effectiveness 
of certain communications and marketing campaigns. We may also use clear 
GIFs in a similar manner in our own emails and on our Site. <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      Clear 
GIFs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they 
are both from the same website or advertising company. That means, for 
example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", which 
uses an advertising company's clear GIF, the website would match the 
clear GIFs identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, 
to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information 
can be shared with the advertising company. We do, at times, provide 
such information to our third-party advertising service partners, but 
that information can only be used by our partner for our benefit.  <br>

</p>
<p align="justify"><b>8. Children, 
parental consent and privacy.</b> <br></p>
<p align="justify">      The 
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000, 
and imposes certain requirements on Site directed toward children under 
13 that collect information on those children, or on Site that know 
they are collecting Personal Information from children under the age 
of 13. We want to let you know that it currently is our policy not to 
collect Personal Information from any person under 13 because children 
are not permitted to use the Site or services on the Site, and we request 
that children under the age of 13 not submit any personal information 
to us via the Site. As one measure to ensure that we do not gather Personal 
Information from children, we require that all individuals provide a 
valid credit card number before completing a purchase order. If we learn 
that we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from children 
under 13, we shall attempt to notify such child's parent or guardian 
and erase such information from our records, unless the child's parent 
or guardian consents to our maintaining such information.  <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><b>9. 
 You should carefully review privacy policies of any third-party Site 
accessible from any of our Site and any co-branded Site not covered 
by this Policy.</b> <br></p>
<p align="justify">      We 
may link to websites, including those of our subsidiaries and third-party 
content providers that have different privacy policies and practices 
from those disclosed here. We assume no responsibility for the policies 
or practices of such linked sites, and encourage you to become acquainted 
with them prior to use.  These other sites may send their own cookies 
or clear GIFs to users, collect data or solicit Personally Identifiable 
Information. Additionally, other companies which place advertising on 
our site may collect information about you when you view or click on 
their advertising through the use of cookies or clear GIFs. We cannot 
control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers 
directly if you have any questions about their use of the information 
that they collect. <br></p>

<p align="justify"><b>10. 
 Policy changes.</b> <br></p>
<p align="justify">      This 
Policy was last changed on August 20, 2008. We reserve the right to change 
the terms of this privacy policy at any time. If we make changes to 
any terms or conditions of the Policy, the changes will be posted on 
this portion of the Site so that you will always know what information 
we gather, how we might use that information, to whom we will disclose 
it and what choices you have. Any change, modification, addition or 
removal of portions of this Policy will be announced on our Site at 
least ten (10) days before it is implemented. Please be sure to check 
this page before proceeding to use our Site.  <br></p>
