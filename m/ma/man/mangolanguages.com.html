<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-c8e7938d-7fff-f84e-de23-c5a05286da15">The security of your Personal Data is of utmost important to us. You should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your Personal Data. We employ reasonable security measures to protect the security of the information you submit to us. For instance, when you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. Our secure servers protect this information using password protection and advanced encryption, and we may use firewall technology for additional protection. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-c8e7938d-7fff-f84e-de23-c5a05286da15">If a password is used to protect your profile and Personal Data, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.

<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-c8e7938d-7fff-f84e-de23-c5a05286da15">Our Site may include discussion forums, or other interactive areas or services, including: blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online hosting or storage services, or other areas or services, including without limitation any Mango social network site and any Mango Premiere movie products, our reading feature, our vocabulary feature, services and/or software licensed to Mango, in which you or third parties create, post, or store any content, messages, comments, questions, information, movies, materials or other items on the Site (collectively, “Interactive Areas”). If you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware that these areas may be open to the public and any Personal Data you voluntarily post or provide at registration may be viewed, collected and/or used by others. We are not responsible for the Personal Data you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, nor are we responsible for how others might use that information, including sending you unsolicited messages. Submissions to the Mango Interactive Areas do not represent the views of Mango, or any individual associated with Mango, and we do not control this content. In no event shall you represent or suggest, directly or indirectly, Mango’s endorsement of user submissions in the Interactive Areas. Mango does not vouch for the accuracy or credibility of any content submitted by users in the Interactive Areas, and does not take any responsibility or assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of reading or viewing user-published content in the Interactive Areas. Through your use of the Interactive Areas, you may be exposed to content that you may find offensive, objectionable, harmful, inaccurate, deceptive or otherwise unsuitable for young children (including children under the age of 18), such as content containing violence, language, drug references or use, or sex. If possible, Mango will attempt to provide applicable ratings from the Motion Picture Association of America prior to accessing any Interactive Areas (“Ratings”), but you acknowledge and agree that Mango is under no obligation to provide you any such Ratings and Mango shall not be liable to you for any reason whatsoever in connection with any Ratings, including the accuracy or completeness thereof or not providing you any Ratings. There may also be risks of dealing with underage persons, people acting under false pretense, international trade issues and foreign nationals. By using the Interactive Areas, you assume any and all associated risks, of any kind or character, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, foreseen or unforeseen, arising out of or in any manner incident, relating or attributable to such use of the Interactive Areas.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-c8e7938d-7fff-f84e-de23-c5a05286da15">Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely.

<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-c8e7938d-7fff-f84e-de23-c5a05286da15">Cookies: Like many other commercial sites, our Site utilizes standard technologies called “cookies” and clear GIFs to collect information about how each of our Sites are used. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were designed to help a website recognize a user’s browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie. Cookies can securely store a customer’s password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections, such as those selected in a “shopping cart.” For instance, cookies allow us to prepopulate (or fill in) an email field with your email address if you revisit one of our Site and place an order. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, or capture your email address.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-c8e7938d-7fff-f84e-de23-c5a05286da15">We send a cookie to your hard drive when you make an order to record the product name, category of product that you ordered, the amount paid, the order number and any referral codes. We also may use cookies to track your session info and collect information about where are you at in the learning process. When you click through to any Site from a promotional email, our third-party advertising service partner may send a cookie to your hard drive recording your IP address and other related information.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-c8e7938d-7fff-f84e-de23-c5a05286da15">Clear GIFs: At times, we work with third-party service partners that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) for our benefit to help us measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs help us better manage content on our Site by informing us of what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of our users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personal Data. These third-party service partners use clear GIFs: (i) in HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients; (ii) to record when products have been ordered from our Site; and (iii) to track the visitor traffic on our Site. These clear GIFs allow us to measure the usage of our Site by visitors and the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. We may also use clear GIFs in a similar manner in our own emails and on our Site.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-c8e7938d-7fff-f84e-de23-c5a05286da15">Clear GIFs can “work with” existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited “www.companyX.com”, which uses an advertising company’s clear GIF, the website would match the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising company’s cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information can be shared with the advertising company. We do, at times, provide such information to our third-party advertising service partners identified in our Data Processing Agreement, but that information can only be used by our partner for our benefit.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-c8e7938d-7fff-f84e-de23-c5a05286da15">Verifiable parental consent is required prior to the collection of any Personal Data from Children, such Personal Data will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. A Child and his/her parents or guardians will have access to that Child’s Personal Data and have the ability to delete or change that information at any time. We will retain Personal Data collected from Children only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.&nbsp;</b></p>

We assume no responsibility for the independent policies, practices and terms of use of such linked platforms, websites and applications, and encourage you to become acquainted with them prior to use. These other platforms, websites and applications may send their own cookies or clear GIFs to users, collect data, or solicit Personal Data. Additionally, other companies which place advertising on our Site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies or clear GIFs. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-c8e7938d-7fff-f84e-de23-c5a05286da15">The Internet is a global environment. Using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. When you provide Mango with Personal Data through the Site, the information will be stored on servers located in the United States – and possibly other countries. Therefore, by accessing and using the Site and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Data may be used, stored and processed in the United States – and possibly in other countries whose laws may not offer a level of protection of Personal Data equivalent to those applied in other areas. Mango’s processing of Personal Data is governed by the <a href="https://mangolanguages.com/legal/terms-and-conditions.cfm">Terms and Conditions including the Data Processing Addendum</a>.</b></p>

We reserve the right to change the terms of this Policy at any time to reflect any changes to our privacy practices in accordance with changes in legislation, best practice or website enhancements. If we make changes to any terms or conditions of the Policy, the changes will be posted in the Terms and Conditions including the Data Processing Addendum or on this portion of the Site, as applicable, so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, to whom we will disclose it and what choices you have. Any change, modification, addition or removal of portions of this Policy will be announced on our Site. Please be sure to check this page before proceeding to use our Site.&nbsp;</b></p>
