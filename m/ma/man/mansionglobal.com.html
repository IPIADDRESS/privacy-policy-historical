If there is a conflict between this Policy and a Dow Jones Online Services corporate subscription agreement, the Dow Jones Online Services corporate subscription agreement will take precedence.</p><p class="text body-copy">This Policy describes Dow Jones's collection and use of users' Personal Information. It also describes generally Dow Jones's practices for handling Other Information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage) collected through our Dow Jones Online Services or from a third party to the extent such information is associated with a particular device, user or user account. As described more fully below, we share information with our affiliated companies ("Dow Jones Affiliates") for the purposes described in this privacy policy.

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</p><p class="text body-copy"><span class="body-caps">Updates to Privacy Policy.</span><span> Dow Jones may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Dow Jones Online Services. Your use of the Dow Jones Online Services or your provision of personal information to us following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.</span></p><p class="text body-copy"><span class="body-caps">Do Not Track Disclosure.</span><span> Some browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time.  The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups and regulators to develop a DNT browser technology standard to provide a common understanding as to how to interpret the DNT signals, but to date no standard has been adopted. Since there is no standard at this time, Dow Jones does not currently respond to DNT signals.  Dow Jones will follow the progress of the W3C in developing the standard.</span></p><p class="text body-copy"><span class="body-caps">Location of Data.</span><span> Your Personal Information may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using our products and services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.</span></p><p class="text body-copy"><span class="body-caps">Data Retention.</span><span> We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.</span></p><p class="text body-copy"><span class="body-caps">Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service.</span><span> In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.
