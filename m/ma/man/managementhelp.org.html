<h1>Free Management Library Data Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This policy covers the website "Free Management Library" at <a href="https://managementhelp.org">https://managementhelp.org</a> 
  and associated services (collectively the “Services”) that may be 
  made available through use of the Website. The Website and the Services are 
  owned and operated by Authenticity Consulting, LLC (“Authenticity”). 
  After reading this policy, should you have privacy questions or concerns, send 
  an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@authenticityconsulting.com">privacy@authenticityconsulting.com</a>.</p>
<p>This policy explains how we (as Authenticity) collect, protect and use information 
  about visitors and users of our Website, including 1) non-personally identifiable 
  information and also 2) personally identifiable information if visitors and 
  users choose to provide it. It also explains how they can have that personal 
  information changed or deleted if they desire. We collect and manage all of 
  this information to make the Website and associated Services work better for 
  our visitors and users.</p>
<h2>Your Implicit Agreement to This Policy</h2>
<p>By visiting the Website or using the Services, you agree to the collection 
  and use of information in the manner described in this policy. Authenticity 
  shall have right at any time and without prior notice, at its sole discretion, 
  to revise this policy. If we makes material changes to this policy, we will 
  notify you by email, by means of a notice the next time you log in to the Website, 
  or when you next utilize the associated Services. Such revisions and additions 
  shall be effective immediately upon notice. You are responsible for reviewing 
  the Website’s Data Privacy Policy periodically for any modification. Any 
  access or use of the Website or Services by you after notice of modifications 
  to this Policy shall constitute and be deemed to be your agreement to such modifications.</p>
<h2>Types of Information That We Collect</h2>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information You Choose to Provide</h3>
<p>We get this type of information only if you choose to provide it. You can also 
  opt out from, change or delete the information at any time. For example, you 
  might provide your name and email address when you subscribe to a newsletter, 
  share feedback to us or subscribe to a blog. You might also provide your postal 
  address, phone number and credit/debit card numbers if you purchase a publication 
  from us. You are responsible for the accuracy of the personal information, including 
  updates or additions.</p>
<h3>Automatically Collected Non-Personally Identifiable Technical Information</h3>
<h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
<p>In addition to the personal information you supply, we may automatically collect 
  certain non-personally identifiable technical information. The technologies 
  we may use to gather this information may include use of “cookies”.</p>
<p>Cookies are very small pieces of information a user's browser stores on the 
  user's computer. We collect this information to (1) evaluate how visitors, guests, 
  and customers use the Website and/or the Services; (2) evaluate the performance 
  of our Website and Services, and (3) also provide you with personalized information 
  if you opt in for that kind of information. You may modify your browser preferences 
  to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. 
  Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your 
  choices about cookies. If you modify your browser preferences, certain features 
  of the Website may not be available to you.</p>
<h4>Google Analytics Use of Cookies</h4>
<p> The Website uses a tool called “Google Analytics” to improve the 
  use of the Website. Google Analytics does not collect users' names or personally 
  identifiable information (information that could be used to personally identify 
  or contact you); it collects only the IP address from which the user accessed 
  the Website. Google analyzes the activity from that address to record the user's 
  time of the visit to the Website, time spent on its pages, the website where 
  the user was referred from, and the user's type of browser and operating system. 
  To collect that information, Google places a cookie on the user's computer. 
  The cookies cannot be used by any organization other than Google. Description 
  of how Google Analytics collects and processes this information is described 
  at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">How Google 
  uses data when you use our partner's sites or apps</a>. Google’s ability 
  to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits 
  to this Website is restricted by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google 
  Analytics Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google 
  Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<h3>For Improving Our Website and Services</h3>
<p>IP addresses define the Internet location of computers and help us better understand 
  the geographic distribution of our visitors and customers and manage the performance 
  of the Website. Cookies are placed onto the hard drive of your computer when 
  you visit the Website, so we can immediately recognize you when you return to 
  the Website and deliver content specific to your interests. </p>
<p>We may detect the type of web browser you are using to optimize the performance 
  of the Website and to understand the mix of browsers used by our visitors, guests, 
  and customers. To learn about how people use our site, we examine various logs 
  of IP usage information, which show the paths people take through the Website 
  and how long they spend in certain areas.</p>
<p>When you use the Services, the Services may collect, in very general terms, 
  your current physical location, your mobile device model number, your mobile 
  device operating system version, and the time when you observed the images or 
  other information provided by the Application. We use that information to ensure 
  the Website and Services conform to the most commonly used devices and operating 
  systems and the timing of their uses.</p>
<h3>For Marketing Purposes Only if You Opt-In</h3>
<p>You can register (opt-in) on the Website or when using the Services to receive 
  promotions and updates, or to be contacted for market research purposes. You 
  can control your privacy preferences regarding such marketing communications 
  (see the section below entitled “Your Privacy Preferences”).</p>
<p>From time to time, you may be invited to participate in optional customer surveys 
  or promotions, and Authenticity may request that you provide some or all of 
  the above listed personal information in those surveys or promotions. We use 
  information collected from surveys and promotions to learn about our customers 
  in order to improve our services and develop new products and services of interest 
  to our customers.</p>
<h3>Potential Provision to Third-Parties Only If Not Personal Marketing to You</h3>
<p>You agree that we are authorized to use, reproduce and generally make such 
  information available to third parties in the aggregate, provided that your 
  information shall not include personally identifiable information about you 
  or be attributable to you.</p>
<p>Authenticity may contract with unaffiliated third parties (e.g. Google) to 
  provide services such as data hosting, advertising, analytics and other services. 
  When we do this, we may provide your personally identifiable information to 
  third parties only to provide those services, and they are explicitly not authorized 
  to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.<br>
  You agree that we are authorized to use, reproduce and generally make such information 
  available to third parties in the aggregate, provided that your information 
  shall not include personally identifiable information about you or be attributable 
  to you.</p>
<h2>Use of the Website and Services by Children</h2>
<p>THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR USE BY CHILDREN UNDER THE 
  AGE OF 13.</p>
<h2>How to Access, Correct or Delete Your Information</h2>
<p>Send Authenticity an email at privacy@authenticityconsulting.com if you want 
  to access, review, correct or delete your personally identifiable information 
  collected by Authenticity. To protect your privacy and security, Authenticity 
  will request certain personally identifiable information to verify your identity 
  before granting you the right to access, review, make corrections or deletions 
  to your personally identifiable information.</p>
<h2> Disclosure of Information</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as 
  required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect 
  our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process. 
  It is also possible that Authenticity may sell one or more of its businesses. 
  If so, then customer information, including your information, may be among the 
  assets that are transferred. If we decide to so transfer your personal information, 
  then you will be notified by an email sent to the last known email address in 
  our files.</p>
<h2>Privacy of Other Websites and Services</h2>
<p>The Website and/or the Services may contain links to other websites or other 
  services Authenticity is not responsible for the privacy practices of those 
  other sites or services. This policy only applies to information directly collected 
  by Authenticity. </p>
