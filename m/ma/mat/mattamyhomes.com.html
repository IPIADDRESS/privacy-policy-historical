    <div class="Title1">  Part (A) Customer Personal Information </div>  <br>
    <div class="Bold"> i) General Overview </div>
    <p>Mattamy Homes is subject to Canada’s privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”). The Act imposes rules on how Mattamy Homes may collect, use and disclose the personal information of its customers and potential customers. It also imposes rules governing the security, retention, accuracy and access to customer personal information.  </p> 

    <a class="bookmark" id="PI" title="What is Personal Information" name="WhatisPersonalInformation"> </a> 
    <div class="Bold"> ii) What Is Personal Information? </div>
    <p>Personal Information is information that identifies an individual and relates specifically to that individual. It can include a (potential) customer’s home address, telephone number, or simply information regarding their interest in or purchase of aMattamy home. <br><br>
       Personal information does not include the name, business telephone number or business address of an employee of another organization (ie “business card information”). This information may be used or disclosed without consent.  </p> 
    <div class="JumpTooA"> <a href="#Top"> BACK TO TOP</a> </div>    <br>

    <a class="bookmark" id="RPC" title="What Restrictions Are Placed on the Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information" name="RestrictionsArePlacedontheCollectionUseandDisclosureofPersonalInformation"> </a> 
    <div class="Bold"> iii) What Restrictions Are Placed on the Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information? </div>
    <p>Generally speaking Mattamy Homes may only collect, use or disclose a customer’s or prospective customer’s personal information if the (prospective) customer has consented to the particular purpose for its use or disclosure (there are some limited exceptions that are normally not applicable to day-to-day business operations). Consent will normally be required to be express from the (potential) customer. However in appropriate circumstances involving less sensitive information, consent may be implied. <br> <br>
       Mattamy Homes generally obtains consent by printing a notice on our data collection forms and website identifying the purposes for which personal information gathered from the (potential) customer will be used or disclosed. Through the filling out of the data collection form, Mattamy Homes obtains the consent of the (potential) customer to use or disclose the personal information for the stated purpose on the form.  <br><br>
      An example might be a web page that indicates that information supplied by a potential customer will be used to provide the individual with information about Mattamy Homes property developments.<br><br>If information is to be used or disclosed for a purpose not identified to the (potential) customer, Mattamy Homes is normally obligated to communicate that additional purpose and obtain additional consent.  The law restricts Mattamy Homes to collecting only personal information necessary to comply with the stated purposes (ie facilitating the transaction with a customer or potential customer including a sale of business or communication of products and services or satisfaction surveys).<br><br>
      Rule #1 Subject to a few exceptions, the personal information of customers and prospective customers should not be used by employees or disclosed outside the company unless consistent with the purposes to which the customer has consented. Where it is unclear if consent is present for a particular use or disclosure, employess shall seek clarification from their manager. <br><br>Rule #2 Employees are expected to notify their Manager immediately of any unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information of which they become aware.</p>

    <a class="bookmark" id="RGS" title="What Are the Rules Governing Security of Personal Information" name="RulesGoverningSecurityofPersonalInformation"> </a> 
    <div class="Bold"> iv) What Are the Rules Governing Security of Personal Information? </div>
    <p>According to PIPEDA Mattamy Homes is required to implement security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information. Customer and prospective customer personal information is kept in a secure area in Mattamy Homes offices. Access to such information is restricted to those employees authorized to use the information.  <br><br>Rule #3 Employees must not access customer/ prospective customer files without appropriate authorization from their supervisor/manager. <br><br>Rule #4 Information properly accessed for authorized purposes should be immediately returned to its secured storage area after its use and not left unattended in a non-secure area. Employees should immediately report any loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, copying or destruction of customer/prospective customer personal information to their supervisor.</p>

    <div class="Bold"> v) What Are the Rules Governing Accuracy of Personal Information? </div>
    <p>Under the law, Mattamy Homes must keep personal information as accurate and up to date as is necessary for the purposes for which it has been collected. Any inaccuracies discovered should be corrected promptly. Notice must also be given to any person or organization holding the information on Mattamy Homes’ behalf to ensure correction. <br><br>Rule #5 Where employees become aware that (prospective customer) personal information maintained in Mattamy Homes’ is inaccurate, notice should be provided to their supervisor/manager in order that the information may be corrected.</p>

    <div class="Bold"> vi) What are the Rules Governing Retention of Personal Information?</div>
    <p>Under the law, Mattamy Homes is obliged to retain personal information about its customers or prospective customers only as is long as is necessary to meet the purposes for which it was collected. <br><br>In addition Mattamy Homes may not destroy personal information if a (potential) customer has requested access to it until after the access process (and any right of appeal regarding an access decision) has been completed. <br><br>Rule #6 Employees who are aware that information is subject to an access request shall not alter, amend or destroy such information until authorization is received from their supervisor/manager.</p>

    <div class="Bold"> vii) Challenging Compliance</div>
    <p>Under the law, members of the public may raise concerns or complaints about Mattamy Homes’ privacy practices.

    <div class="Bold"> viii) Access</div>
    <p>The law normally permits customers or potential customers to access their own personal information in the custody or control of Mattamy Homes. Normally, Mattamy Homes is required to respond to such requests (either denying or granting access) within 30 days of receiving the request. In appropriate circumstances Mattamy Homes may charge a reasonable fee for responding to the request.<br><br>Rule #8 Any requests to access personal information in the custody or control of Mattamy Homes by a member of the public should be immediately referred to the Chief Privacy Officer for response.</p>
