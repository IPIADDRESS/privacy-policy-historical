               into two categories:  1) "non-public information", which consists of purchase 
               history information and one-on-one communications between you and other users 
               of the Site; and 2) "public information", which consists of all other 
               demographic information.  We ask that you do not enter personal information 
               or financial information into your “Profile” (for example, don’t use your 
               address or passcode as your username, or include your name or address in 
               your written responses), because if you do then it may be posted 
               publicly on the Site, and the information will then be treated as 
               "demographic information" that is "public information."  
               Please note that nowhere on the Site do we knowingly collect 
               personal information from children under the age of 18, as we 
               require that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years old.
