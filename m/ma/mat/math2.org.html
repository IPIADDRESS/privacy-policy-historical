<h2>Math2.org Privacy Policy</h2>


<p>
The following statements pertain only to the pages on the
Math2.org web server (www.math2.org).
</p>


<ul>
<li>
We respect your and your child's privacy and urge everyone to check
for a privacy policy on any site that requests personal information.
</li>
<li>
We do not sell or disseminate personally identifiable information
about site visitors to third parties, except to report site
abuse.
</li><li>
We do not send or promote junk e-mail (spam).
</li>
<li>
This site is privately owned and operated.
</li>
</ul>

<b>Exceptions:</b>

<ul>
<li>
We reserve the right to collect data on users for strictly
internal use, such as in maintaining access and error logs.
This is common practice for improving site performance and
recording site abuse.
</li>

<li>
On the message boards, personally identifiable information (such as
e-mail addresses) will be disseminated if the user explicitly chooses
to post it.  Publicly posting one's e-mail address is discouraged
(e.g. spam), and we recommend instead using the "message forwarding"
option which does not make your e-mail public.  </li>

</ul>
