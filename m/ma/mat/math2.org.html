<h2>Math2.org Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Date: 2001-04-07</p>

<p>
The following statements pertain only to the pages on the
Math2.org web server (www.math2.org) and pages on the former
Dave's Math Tables web site (www.sisweb.com/math).
Math2.org is in the process of transferring its resources off the
www.sisweb.com/math site and onto the www.math2.org server; therefore,
both locations must currently be mentioned here.

These statements do not apply to pages residing on other
servers that Math2.org links to or even those sites what have a
relationship with Math2.org.
</p>


<ul>
<li>
We respect your and your child's privacy and urge everyone to check
for a privacy policy on any site that requests personal information.
</li>
<li>
We do not sell or disseminate personally identifiable information
about site visitors to third parties, except to report site
abuse.
</li><li>
We do not send or promote junk e-mail (spam).
</li>
</ul>

<b>Exceptions:</b>

<ul>
<li>
We reserve the right to collect data on users for strictly
internal use, such as in maintaining access and error logs.
This is common practice for improving site performance and
recording site abuse.
</li>

<li>
On the message boards, personally identifiable information
(such as e-mail addresses) will be disseminated if the user
explicitly chooses to post it.  Publicly posting one's e-mail
address is discouraged and is not necessary because of the
"message forwarding" option, which achieves the same function.
</li>

<li>
We do at times post
web site addresses and sometimes contact information of
web site administrators
for purposes of linking to web resources and generating external traffic.
All requests for address removal will be honored.
</li>

<li>We do not currently use web browser "cookies," but we
reserve the right to do so since some purely technical reasons
warrant their use.  Cookie support can be restricted or disabled
on each individual web browser if the user chooses to do so.<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
