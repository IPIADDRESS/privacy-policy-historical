		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal
			information by Math Plus Motion LLC ("we", "us").
			As we update and expand our services, this policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically. By
			accessing the Math Antics Site ("Site") you consent to these policies.</p>

		<h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>

		<p>Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you, specifically your name
			and e-mail address.</p>

		<p>When you create an account on our Site, we ask you to supply us with personal information so that we can
			communicate with you regarding your account.
			With your permission we also use your e-mail address to send you newsletters, as well as messages about Math
			Antics special offers,
			promotional announcements and consumer surveys.</p>

		<p>We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your site activity.
			We use this information for such purposes as enhancing our service offering for our customers.</p>

		<p>While using the Math Antics Site, you will have opportunities to post comments that are viewable by the
			public.
			Please understand that when you post such information, it is not subject to this policy, and you should not
			include personal
			information in any publicly viewable posts.</p>

		<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

		<p>The Math Antics Site contains links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling
			of personal information may differ from ours.
			While we endeavor to associate with reputable sites, we cannot be responsible for the information handling
			practices of these other sites.</p>

		<h2>Children</h2>

		<p>You must be 13 years of age or older to subscribe to the Math Antics Site. While individuals under the age of
			13 may utilize the service,
			they may do so only with the involvement of a responsible adult who agrees to our Terms of Use.
			While we do have content that may be watched by children, we do not intentionally collect information from
			individuals 13 years of age and younger.</p>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>

		<p>When you log in to your Math Antics account, if you select "Remember Me", cookies are placed on your
			computer's hard drive.
			(Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your hard
			drive for record keeping purposes.)
			The cookies will store enough information to automatically log you in to your account the next time you
			visit the Site.
			If your browser is set to not accept cookies, you will not be able to use this feature.</p>

		<p>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to the Math Antics

		<h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>

		<p>We will not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to third parties.</p>

		<p>In the event that Math Antics is acquired by or merged with a third party, we reserve the right to sell or
			otherwise transfer
			the personal information we have collected as part of that transaction. If the third party has a different
			privacy policy than ours,
			we will notify you in advance and give you an opportunity to prevent your personal information from being
			shared.</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>

		<p>We take information security very seriously and use reasonable administrative, technical and managerial
			measures to protect your
			personal information from unauthorized access. For example, we only store your password in encrypted
			form.</p>

		<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for restricting
			access to your computer
			or mobile device through which you access your Math Antics account. Users of public or shared computers or
			unprotected mobile devices
			should log out at the completion of each visit to the Math Antics Site.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the
			security of your personal
			information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. By using this Site, or providing personal
			information to us
			through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy,
			and administrative
			issues relating to your use of this site.</p>

		<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

		<p>As we update and expand our services, we may make changes to this policy. You should check back for updates
			to this policy from time to time.
			If the changes result in materially less protection for your personal information than that provided in this
			policy,
			we will make reasonable efforts to contact you and obtain your consent to the changes.
			Your use of the Math Antics Site or continued use of our service after our efforts to contact you
			means that you agree to be bound by such changes.</p>
