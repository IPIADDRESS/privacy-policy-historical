<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by Math Plus Motion LLC ("we", "us").
    As we update and expand our services, this policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically. By accessing the Math Antics Site ("Site") you consent to these policies.</p>
<h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>

<p>While using the Math Antics Site, you will have opportunities to post comments that are viewable by the public.
    Please understand that when you post such information, it is not subject to this policy, and you should not include personal
    information in any publicly viewable posts.</p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>The Math Antics Site contains links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of personal information may differ from ours.
    While we endeavor to associate with reputable sites, we cannot be responsible for the information handling practices of these other sites.</p>

    (Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your hard drive for record keeping purposes.)
    The cookies will store enough information to automatically log you in to your account the next time you visit the Site.

<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for restricting access to your computer
    or mobile device through which you access your Math Antics account. Users of public or shared computers or unprotected mobile devices
    should log out at the completion of each visit to the Math Antics Site.</p>

    information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. By using this Site, or providing personal information to us
    through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative
    issues relating to your use of this site.</p>
