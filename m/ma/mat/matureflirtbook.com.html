                    Our goal is to provide visitors of our website with information that is as relevant as possible for them. That means that we try to customize our website as much as possible to fit the needs of every individual user. We do not only do this through the content on our website, but also through the ads that are displayed. <br><br>In order for us to make these personal adjustments we try using the websites that you visit to develop an idea of your presumed interests, without building a profile or identifying you as a person. Based on this information we adapt the content and advertising on our website for different target groups. This means that according to your online behaviour you will fit in a certain category, such as 'men in the age group 20-30 years old, married and children with an interest in football.'
