<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matcherino, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “</span><b>Matcherino</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) is committed to protecting your privacy. &nbsp;We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the personal information we collect from users of our website (the “</span><b>Site</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) and our online services (the “</span><b>Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”).</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Questions; Contacting Matcherino; Reporting Violations</strong><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &nbsp;If you have any questions or concerns or complaints about our Privacy Policy or our data collection or processing practices, or if you want to report any security violations to us, please contact us at &nbsp;the following email address:</span></b>Matcherino, Inc.<br>
<a href="mailto:support@matcherino.com">support@matcherino.com</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: bold;"><b><b>A Note About Children</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &nbsp;We do not intentionally gather personal information from visitors who are under the age of 13. &nbsp;If a child under 13 submits personal information to the Matcherino and we learn that the personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. &nbsp;If you believe that we might have any personal information from a child under 13, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@matcherino.com">support@matcherino.com</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Types of Data We Collect. &nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect personal information from users, as described below.</span>
<ol style="font-weight: bold;" type="a">
<li style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Information You Provide to Us. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may collect personal information from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail, username and password when you create an account to log in to our network (“</span><b>Account</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will collect payment information necessary to complete a transaction, including your name, credit card information, and billing information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you post content (text, images, photographs, messages, comments or any other kind of content that is not your e-mail address) on our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored in our servers and other users will be able to see it, along with your profile photo, user name and any other information that you choose to make public on your public profile page (</span><b>“Profile”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">). &nbsp;The information that you provide in your Profile will be visible to others, including anonymous visitors to the Site.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you participate in an activity on our Services, such as promoting, endorsing or donating to a gamer and/or their contests and matches, we will collect that information and add it to your Profile.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you sign up for our newsletter we will collect you email address.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or giveaway on our Site, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not). &nbsp;We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity. &nbsp;In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. &nbsp;These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary. &nbsp;We recommend that you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also collect personal information, such as at other points in our Service that state that personal information is being collected.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Information Collected from Twitch and other Social Networking Sites</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &nbsp;Our Services may enable users to register for an account using their Twitch login credentials or third party social networking service (“</span><b>SNS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) supported by us. &nbsp;If you are not a registered user of the Services and you click “Sign In” using Twitch or another SNS that we support, you will first be asked to enter your Twitch or SNS credentials and then be given the option to register for the Services. &nbsp;In this case, we may receive information from Twitch or another SNS to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Site. &nbsp;Any information that we collect from Twitch or other SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with Twitch or that SNS, so please consult the relevant SNS’s privacy and data practices.</span></li>
<li><b>Information Collected via Technology. </b>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log Files.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. &nbsp;This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“</span><b>ISP</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. &nbsp;We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. &nbsp;&nbsp;Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &nbsp;Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. &nbsp;</span><b>“Cookies”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. &nbsp;We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of information is collected to make the Service more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pixel Tag</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s. In addition, we use </span><b>“Pixel Tags</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). &nbsp;Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies that are used to track online movements of Web users. &nbsp;In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. &nbsp;Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. &nbsp;We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. &nbsp;We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ personal information.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic Analytics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &nbsp;We use a number of third party service provides, such as Google Analytics, to help analyze how users use the Service (“</span><b>Analytics Companies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). &nbsp;These Analytics Companies uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Service, what features they use on our Site, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from these Analytics Companies only to improve our Site and Services. These Analytics Companies collect only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Service, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. &nbsp;We do not combine the information generated through the use of our Analytics Companies with your personal information. Although these Analytics Companies may plant a persistent Cookie on your web browser or mobile device to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but the Analytics Company that placed the applicable Cookie. &nbsp;This Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for the Cookies used by these Analytics Companies.</span></li>
