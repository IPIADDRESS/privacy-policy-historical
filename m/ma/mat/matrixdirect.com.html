	<h1>Matrix Direct Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>Protecting the privacy of information about our customers is important.
	   This notice tells you how we treat information about our current and
	   former customers.
	</p>
	<p>
	We do not sell information about our customers. We maintain physical,
	electronic and procedural safeguards to protect it. Access to information
	about our customers is limited to people who need access to do their jobs.
	</p><p>
	We get most of the information we need from customer applications and
	other forms. If a customer authorizes it, we may get information from others.
	</p><p>
	For example, when a person applies for life insurance we may ask for
	permission to get information from insurance support organizations such as
	the Medical Information Bureau and Consumer reporting agencies.
	</p>

	<p><span style="font-size:120%">CUSTOMER INFORMATION</span><br>
		such as Name, Address, Telephone Number, and Demographic Data.
	</p>

	<p><span style="font-size:120%">FINANCIAL INFORMATION</span><br>
		such as Credit History, Income, Assets, and Other Insurance Products.
	</p>

	<p><span style="font-size:120%">HEALTH INFORMATION</span><br>
		such as Medical history and other factors affecting insurability.
	</p>

	<p>
		We use the information for business purposes, such as
</p><ul>
			<li>
				processing applications and claims,</li>
			<li>
				servicing your business, and</li>
			<li>
				offering you other products and services.
			</li>
</ul>
	<p>
	We share the information with others who provide services to help us process or
	administer our business.
	</p><p>
		For example, we may share information with
</p><ul>
			<li>
				a company that prints our customer statements,</li>
			<li>
				medical examiners who help us underwrite life insurance applications,</li>
			<li>
				service providers who help us process claims.
			</li>
</ul>
	<p>
	We require that our service providers limit their use of the information and keep it confidential.
	</p>

	<p>
    We may share Customer Information with our affiliated companies to offer
    customers other financial products and financial services that may be of
    interest to them. In most states, we may share Customer Information with
    companies not affiliated with us so that those companies, such as
    insurance or financial service companies, may also offer you financial
    products and services. However, you have the right to tell us that you
    don't want us to share any information with these companies. This right
    is known as the right to “opt out.”
    </p>

    <p>
	We do not share Customer Information about our customers who live in
	Montana, New Mexico, or Vermont with any non-affiliated companies for
	marketing purposes, so residents of those states do not need to opt-out.
	</p>

	<p>
	You may opt out at any time by sending us a written request. Even if
	you opt out we may still disclose information as allowed or required by law.
	</p>

	<p>
	We will not share information with anyone else unless
		</p><ul>
			<li>
				we have the customer's permission, or
			</li>
			<li>
				we are allowed or required by law to disclose it.
			</li>
		</ul>
	<p></p>

	<h2><span class="bold"> Notification of Changes</span></h2>
	<p>
	This policy effective 03-31-09. If we decide to change our privacy policy,
	we will post those changes on our Web site. Access to those changes will
	be presented via a link on our homepage and other places we deem
	appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect,
	how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We
	will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which
	the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users'
	personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated
	at the time of collection, we will notify users via email or postal mail.
	Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in
	this different manner. However, if users have opted out of receiving
	communication from Matrix Direct Insurance Services Inc., then they will
	not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new
	manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy
	practices that do not affect user information already stored in our
	database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users
	of the change.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Information Collection on the Web
	</h2>

	<p>
	Matrix Direct collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<br>
		Cookies</h2>
	<p>
	A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to
	information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked
	to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We
	use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the
	session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply
	terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the
	user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent
	cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file
	directions. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our
	site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of
	our users to enhance the experience on our site.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<br>
		Third Party Cookies and Action Tags</h2>
	<p>We may also use a service that collects data remotely by using web beacons or tags embedded in our site's content. The data we collect includes which operating system and browser you use, how you navigate to and through our site, and how long you stay on our web pages. This information is anonymous and does not include your name, e-mail address, or any other contact information. We share this information with other AIG companies and with our third party vendor, Visual Sciences Inc. Visual Sciences Inc. gives us reports of this aggregated, anonymous data. We use this data to improve our site by responding to our users' interests and providing more relevant and useful information. To learn more about Visual Sciences Inc.'s privacy standards and use of web beacons, please visit:
	<a href=" http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html." target="_blank">http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html</a>.

	</p><p>We use a third-party advertising company for the purposes of serving ads on sites on which we advertise and measuring traffic coming from such sites.  Third-party advertising technology (1) uses information derived from your visits to this Web site and the sites on which we advertise to serve ads to you and (2) places or recognizes a unique third-party cookie on your browser.  In addition, we use Web beacons, provided by such third-party advertising company, to help manage and optimize our online advertising.  Web beacons enable us to recognize a browser’s cookie when that browser visits this Web site, and to learn which ads bring users to this Web site.  To "opt-out," please visit:

	</p><h2><br>
		Links</h2>
	<p>
	This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Matrix
	Direct insurance Services, are not responsible for the privacy practices of
	such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site
	and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects
	personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
	information collected by this Web site.

	</p><h2>
		<br>
		Security</h2>
	<p>
	This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.
	When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their
	information is protected both online and off-line. When our quote
	request form asks users to enter sensitive information
	(such health information), that information is encrypted and is protected
	with 128 bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption software. While on a
	secure page, such as our quote request form, the lock icon on the bottom
	of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
	becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just
	'surfing'. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information
	online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information
	off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information
	mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the
	information to perform a specific job (for example, an agent or a customer
	service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
	information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security
	and privacy practices. Every year, as well as any time new policies are
	added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we
	place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is
	protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable
	information are in a secure environment in a locked facility. If you have
	any questions about the security at our Web site, send an email to
	<a href="mailto:customerservice2@matrixdirect.com">customerservice2@matrixdirect.com</a>.
