        Matrix Direct, Inc. ("Matrix Direct"), recognizes that protecting the 
        privacy and security of the personal information we obtain about our customers 
        is an important responsibility. This Privacy Notice generally describes 
        our policy about how we treat that information. This notice refers to 
        Matrix Direct using the terms "we," "us," and "our." <br>
        <br>
        <i>How we obtain information.</i> <br>
        We obtain most of the information we need directly from you on your application 
        or other forms you complete, or from those you have authorized to provide 
        information to us in connection with providing our services to you. We 
        also obtain information in the course of processing and recording your 
        transactions with us. <br>
        <br>
        <i>Information we may obtain. </i><br>
        The type of information we obtain depends on the type of product or service 
        in which you express interest. The types of information we may obtain 
        fall into the following three general categories: <br>
        <br>
        - <i>Customer Information</i>. Customer information includes identifying 
        information such as your name, address, telephone number, and demographic 
        data about you. It also includes information about your transactions with 
        us such as the insurers to which your application for insurance has been 
        submitted as well as the type, value and premiums of the insurance product 
        for which you are applying. <br>
        - <i>Financial Information</i>. Financial information is information covered 
        by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and includes information such as your 
        credit history, income, assets, type and value of other insurance products 
        you own or for which you have applied, and amount of insurance premiums 
        you pay for those other products. <br>
        - <i>Health Information</i>. Health information includes information about 
        your health and medical history, and your insurance underwriting risk 
        factors. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003366"> <i>Security 
        of the information</i>. <br>
        We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply 
        with Federal and State laws to protect all the information we have obtained 
        about you. <br>
        <br>
        <i>What we do with the information we obtain</i>. <br>
        We use information about you for business purposes such as identifying 
        the insurers and the insurance products and services which will meet your 
        needs and processing your insurance applications. We may also use information 
        about you to offer you other products and services we provide. <br>
        <i><br>

        Under our current privacy policy, we do not sell information about you

        Transitions</b> <br>
        In the event Matrix Direct Insurance Services goes through a business 
        transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling 
        a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, 
        be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent 
        notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control 
        of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, 
        the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner 
        different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given 
        choice consistent with our notification of changes section. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003366"><b>Links

        This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, 
        Matrix Direct, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of 
        such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003366"><b>Security 
        </b><br>
        This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
        When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information 
        is protected both online and off-line. When our quote request form asks 
        users to enter sensitive information (such health information), that information 
        is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the 
        industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our quote request form, 
        the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator 
        and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, 
        or open, when users are just 'surfing'. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003366">While 
        we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also 
        do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of 
        our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, 
        is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information 
        to perform a specific job (for example, an agent or a customer service 
        representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 
        Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave 
        their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain 
        access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date 
        on our security and privacy practices. Every year, as well as any time 
        new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about 
        the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our 
        users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally 
        identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility. 
        If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users 
        can send an email to info@matrixdirect.com </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003366"><b>Notification 
        of Changes</b><br>
        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
        to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate 
        so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use 
        it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use 
        information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information 
        was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable 
        information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection 
        we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether 
        or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if 
        users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated 
        their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal 
        information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material 
        changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already 
        stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site 
        notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we 
        will also mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, 
        notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. </font></p>
