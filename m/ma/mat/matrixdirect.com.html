              Matrix Direct, Inc. ("Matrix Direct"), recognizes that protecting 
              the privacy and security of the personal information we obtain about 
              our customers is an important responsibility. This Privacy Notice 
              generally describes our policy about how we treat that information. 
              This notice refers to Matrix Direct using the terms "we," "us," 
              and "our." <br>
              <br>
              <i>How we obtain information.</i> <br>
              We obtain most of the information we need directly from you on your 
              application or other forms you complete, or from those you have 
              authorized to provide information to us in connection with providing 
              our services to you. We also obtain information in the course of 
              processing and recording your transactions with us. We may use third-party 
              advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies 
              may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs

              <i>Information we may obtain. </i><br>
              The type of information we obtain depends on the type of product 
              or service in which you express interest. The types of information 
              we may obtain fall into the following three general categories: 
              <br>
              <br>
              - <i>Customer Information</i>. Customer information includes identifying 
              information such as your name, address, telephone number, and demographic 
              data about you. It also includes information about your transactions 
              with us such as the insurers to which your application for insurance 
              has been submitted as well as the type, value and premiums of the 
              insurance product for which you are applying. <br>
              - <i>Financial Information</i>. Financial information is information 
              covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and includes information 
              such as your credit history, income, assets, type and value of other 
              insurance products you own or for which you have applied, and amount 
              of insurance premiums you pay for those other products. <br>
              - <i>Health Information</i>. Health information includes information 
              about your health and medical history, and your insurance underwriting 
              risk factors. <br>
              </font></p>

              In the event Matrix Direct Insurance Services goes through a business 
              transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, 
              or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information 
              will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users 
              will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days 
              prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. 
              If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally 
              identifiable information will be used in a manner different from 
              that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice 
              consistent with our notification of changes section. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003366"><b>Links 
              </b><br>
              This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that 
              we, Matrix Direct, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices 
              of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
              leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every 
              Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This 
              privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this 
              Web site. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003366"><b>Security 
              </b><br>
              This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
              When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their 
              information is protected both online and off-line. When our quote 
              request form asks users to enter sensitive information (such health 
              information), that information is encrypted and is protected with 
              the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure 
              page, such as our quote request form, the lock icon on the bottom 
              of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet 
              Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when 
              users are just 'surfing'. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003366">While 
              we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we 
              also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. 
              All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information 
              mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who 
              need the information to perform a specific job (for example, an 
              agent or a customer service representative) are granted access to 
              personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected 
              screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they 
              must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. 
              Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and 
              privacy practices. Every year, as well as any time new policies 
              are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the 
              importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our 
              users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store 
              personally identifiable information are in a secure environment 
              in a locked facility. If users have any questions about the security 
              at our Web site, users can send an email to info@matrixdirect.com 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003366"><b>Notification 
              of Changes</b><br>
              If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
              to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem 
              appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we 
              collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we 
              disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy 
              policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we 
              are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a 
              manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will 
              notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or 
              not we use their information in this different manner. However, 
              if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated 
              their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal 
              information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make 
              any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect 
              user information already stored in our database, we will post a 
              prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. 
              In some cases where we post a notice we will also mail users, who 
              have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of 
              the changes in our privacy practices. </font></p>
