<p><strong>Concept Learning Technologies Pvt. Ltd. is committed to protecting the
privacy of website visitors and does not share personally identifiable
information with third parties without your consent. Concept Learning
Technologies Pvt. Ltd. collects information at several different points on the
Math Buddy Online web site and related applications and is the sole owner of
all information that is collected.</strong></p><br>
	  <p>This policy has been updated to comply with GDPR. We have made some changes
in our apps, websites and services for all users and visitors worldwide.</p><br>
          <p><strong>1) What information does Math Buddy gather/track and how is it used?</strong></p>
          <p>PERSONAL INFORMATION: Because of the nature of our product, we must collect
personal information from users during the registration process, including (at
minimum) first &amp; last names, email address and a password.<br>
          <br>Concept Learning Technologies Pvt. Ltd. has partnered with various financial service
providers for payment processing.<strong>Concept Learning Technologies Pvt. Ltd. has
no access to any of the financial information including credit cards or bank
information entered by the user.</strong></p><br>
          <p>Your email address may be used to send you periodic newsletters from Concept
Learning Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Users can opt out of promotional emails at anytime,
but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and
customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the service to
you. We use the information collected to deliver services, process payments, update
our records, communicate with you about products and services and generally
maintain your accounts with us.<strong>We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your
personal information to third parties for unknown reasons.</strong></p><br>

          <p><strong>SESSION RECORDS:</strong> To maintain our quality of service and to assist in the analysis
of product performance, we may also gather data about the usage of various
features in Math Buddy. The gathered information is used only to ensure the highest
quality experience possible when using Math Buddy.</p><br>

          <p><strong>TRAFFIC PATTERNS:</strong> We also track aggregate traffic patterns throughout our site.
However, we do not correlate this information with personally identifiable data about
individual users. We do track domain names, browser types and MIME type. Such
information will not be passed to third parties without your prior consent unless
where required by applicable law.</p><br>

          <p><strong>COOKIES:</strong> A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive
when you visit them. We use cookies to track user scores from activities and also
hold some information about sessions. We do not store passwords or any Personal
Information about you in the cookies.</p><br>

          <p>We continuously improve our Web sites and utilize different Web analytic tools to
help us do so. We are interested in how visitors use our Web sites, what they like
and dislike, and where they have problems. The Web beacons used in connection

with our Web analytics services do not share any personally identifiable information
about our Web site visitors with third parties. Our tools may gather data such as what
browser a person uses, what operating systems are used, and what content,
products and services are reviewed when visiting or registering for services at one of
our Web sites. This information is used solely to assist Concept Learning

and as part of our affiliate referral programs. When a partner refers a visitor to us
from any of these sites, they set a Web beacon and a cookie on our site. An ad ID
and a partner ID are stored in the cookie, but no personally identifiable information
specific to the actual visitor is stored. Concept Learning Technologies Pvt. Ltd. does
not see the cookie; we only include the Web beacon on our page, which results in a
request to the partner's servers from the customer browser. We have no control over
their use of the cookie after it is placed on our site.

          <p><strong>2). With whom does Concept Learning Technologies Pvt. Ltd. share the
information?</strong></p>
          <p>Ensuring your privacy is important to us. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal
information to third parties.</p><br>
          <p>We may occasionally employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf.
Examples include processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and email,
analyzing data and providing marketing assistance. They have access to personal
information needed only to perform their functions and may not use it for any other
purpose.</p><br>
