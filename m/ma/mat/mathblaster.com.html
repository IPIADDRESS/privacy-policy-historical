                information may not be collected.</p>

                What other types of information may we collect?</h5>

                sharing that information with KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE . In addition, some services are
                provided in conjunction with partner companies. If your personal information is

                at the time the information is collected. If you do not want your information shared,
                you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular
                service or by not providing any information at that time.</p>

                vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process,
                analyze and/or store data. We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not
                use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to
                maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personal information
                they obtain from us. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information
                as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing
                such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against
                you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for a KNOWLEDGE
                ADVENTURE site or product or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally
                or unintentionally) with KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE's rights or property, other users of

                activities.</p>
            <p class="description">
                As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE
                and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose
                your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business
                to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection
                with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in
                the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar
                event, your personal information may be transferred to KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE's successor
                or assign.</p>
            <p class="description">
                Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we
                provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same
                privacy and security procedures as KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE.</p>
            <p class="description">
                KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE sites may also have message boards and/or chat areas, where
                users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message
                board or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly
                available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.</p>

                personal information?</h5>
            <p class="description">
                KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE attempts to allow you to control the way that we use personally
                identifiable information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal
                information, KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may give you the option of declining any future
                offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition,
                many of the "mailings" KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may send you, such as newsletters, have
                procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.</p>
            <p class="description">
                If at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal information shared with
                third parties and/or receiving information from KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE (via e-mail
                or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You
                may contact us at Knowledge Adventure, Inc., 2377 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 302, Torrance,
                CA 90501. You can also contact us by e-mailing us at opt-out@adventure.com . Please
                indicate what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we
                may better address your needs.</p>

                Information From Children Under 13</h5>
            <p class="description">
                Once a child states that his/her age is under 13, we do not collect or store any
                personally identifiable information such as name, address, or email address.</p>
            <p class="description">
                <b>Note to Parents:</b> We believe protecting personal information about young children
                is important. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their
                real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when online. Teenagers
                under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review
                this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or
                to raise any concerns.</p>

                What are cookies and how are they used?</h5>
            <p class="description">
                Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web sites to transfer bits
                of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on
                your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have
                already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the
                time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration.
                In addition, KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may use cookies to retrieve user information for
                promotional, marketing or security purposes.</p>

                What are Internet protocol addresses?</h5>
            <p class="description">
                An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server
                or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may track such IP addresses
                for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, or to
