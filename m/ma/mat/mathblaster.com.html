            <h2>With whom may your personal information be shared?</h2>
            <p>
                We may need to disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyze and/or store data. 
                We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, 
                security and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special 
                cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against you if you are violating the 
                Terms of Service or Use Agreements for one of our sites, products or applications or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with our 
                rights or property, other users of our sites, applications or products, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Knowledge Adventure and will become part of our normal business records. As such, 
                we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service 
                and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, 
                or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to our successor or assign.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy 
                and security procedures as Knowledge Adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our sites may also have message boards and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board or chat area, 
                please be aware that the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.
            </p>
            <h2>What choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?</h2>
            <p>
                We make every attempt to allow you to control the way that we use personally identifiable information that you choose to provide. At the time you provide personal information, 
                we may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may 
                send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.
            </p>
            <p>
                If at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties and/or receiving information from us (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, 
                services, or promotions, you can do so. You may contact us at Knowledge Adventure, Inc., 2377 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 302, Torrance, CA 90501. You can also contact us by e-mailing us 
                at opt-out@jumpstart.com . Please indicate what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better address your needs.

            <h2>What to do if you want to correct or delete your personal information?</h2>
            <p>
                If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, 
                please contact KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, at Knowledge Adventure, Inc., 2377 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 302, Torrance, CA 90501.

            <h2>How secure is your personal information?</h2>
            <p>
                While we take reasonable steps to secure your personal information, no system is fault proof. If our security systems are breached we may attempt to notify you electronically and, 
                by using the Service and/or providing personal information to us, you agree that we can notify you electronically. We may post a notice on the Web Sites if a security breach occurs. 
                If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view our site(s). We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, 
                you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) 
                you should notify us at privacy@jumpstart.com. If your email address changes and you have provided us with personal information, you should notify us at privacy@jumpstart.com so that we 
                can communicate with you if necessary.
            </p>
