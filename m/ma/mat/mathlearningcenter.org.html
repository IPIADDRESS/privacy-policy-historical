<p><strong> Introduction </strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is important to The Math Learning Center (“MLC,” “us,” “our,” and/or “we”). This Privacy Statement describes our information and privacy practices that apply when you use MLC’s websites located at <a href="http://www.mathlearningcenter.org">http://www.mathlearningcenter.org</a>, <a href="http://catalog.mathlearningcenter.org">http://catalog.mathlearningcenter.org</a>, and <a href="http://bridges1.mathlearningcenter.org">http://bridges1.mathlearningcenter.org</a> (collectively, the “Websites”) and MLC’s Geoboard, Math Vocabulary Cards, Number Frames, Number Line, Number Pieces, Number Pieces Basic, Number Rack, and Pattern Shapes applications (collectively, the “Apps”). For purposes of this Privacy Statement, the Websites and the Apps are collectively referred to as the “Website,” and the term “Website” means one or more of the Websites and/or Apps.</p>
<p>PLEASE READ this Privacy Statement before you use the Website. Your use of the Website signifies that you have read and agree with all of the terms of this Privacy Statement and consent to the collection and use of your personal information by MLC, as described in this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Statement, do not use the Website. If you are acting on behalf of an entity, you represent that you have full authority to bind your entity to this Privacy Statement. If you do not have such authority, do not use the Website.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to update and revise this Privacy Statement at any time. We will post any new or revised Privacy Statement here, and you should review this Privacy Statement regularly to make sure you are aware of its terms.&nbsp;You can determine whether this Privacy Statement has been revised since your last visit by referring to the Last Updated date at the top of this page.&nbsp;If changes are significant, we may, but are not required to, also notify you of such changes to this Privacy Statement by posting a notice on the homepage of the Website. Your use of the Website following such revision constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Statement as amended by us, and the revisions will apply to Automatically Collected Information and Personally Identifiable Information (described below) collected on and after the date on which we post the revised Privacy Statement.</p>
<p><strong> Information Collected </strong></p>
<p><em> A. Personally Identifiable Information </em></p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected on the Website may consist of information including, but not limited to, your full name; home or business address; billing address; phone number; fax number; email address; other information that could be used to contact you via mail, in person, or online or to identify you personally; demographic information (such as your ZIP code); details regarding your school or institution, including school/institution type, school/institution name, school/institution district, school/institution size, and number of students; employment-related information, such as your job title; personal information you input into any message box if you fill out a “Contact Us” form, “Request a Guest Pass” form, “Order” form, or similar form on the Website; information submitted to us via email; information you input into any open text box or search box, including search terms, comments, and other miscellaneous information; and any other information you actively enter into the Website.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information may be provided by you to us in several ways, including but not limited to: when you contact us through the Website; fill out and submit a form to obtain additional information about the products and services we offer, including requests for guest passes and free trials; sign up to receive our newsletter and other information from us; or join our mailing list.</p>
<p>In order to participate in the online services we provide, you may be asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp;YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PROVIDE US WITH YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO BROWSE THE WEBSITE, AND WE COLLECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM YOU ONLY WHEN YOU VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE IT TO US.&nbsp;YOU ARE NEVER UNDER ANY OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.&nbsp;However, if you do not provide Personally Identifiable Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Website.&nbsp;When you do provide us your Personally Identifiable Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement and to store your Personally Identifiable Information on our servers located in the United States.</p>
<p><em> B. Automatically Collected Information </em></p>
<p>As soon as you navigate to the Website and continue to browse through the Website, we automatically collect and store information about your visit such as: date and time of visit, duration of visit, type of web browser used, operating system/platform used, your IP address, the websites from which you linked to the Website, and your CPU speed. We may also note whether and how you use the Website by recording site traffic patterns and “clickstreams.” This information allows us to track what visitors to the Website are looking at most frequently so we can analyze trends; recognize and deliver more of the desired features, products and services; and continually improve the performance and functionality of the Website.&nbsp;Unless prohibited by law, this Automatically Collected Information may be combined with Personally Identifiable Information you have provided.</p>
<p><strong> How We Collect Automatically Collected Information </strong></p>
<p><em> A. Cookies </em></p>
<p>We may use a feature of your internet browser called a “cookie” (a small file automatically placed on your hard drive, which assigns you a unique, random number that acts as a sort of anonymous ID) to facilitate site navigation and internet sessions.&nbsp;Standing alone, a cookie does not identify Personally Identifiable Information of a user; rather, it identifies the computer that a user uses to access the Website.&nbsp;Unless you choose to identify yourself to us, such as by filling out a form, you remain anonymous to us when browsing the Website. Cookies may be used to remember your personal settings, pre-fill forms for you, and to monitor your use of the Website to improve our services.</p>
<p>There are two types of cookies: Session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session, and they disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or otherwise end your session. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or otherwise end your session.</p>
<p>We use session cookies to provide us information about the Website features used and activities conducted while you are using the Website. We also use session cookies to help process information you input into the Website, such as products you add to your order on the <a href="http://catalog.mathlearningcenter.org">http://catalog.mathlearningcenter.org</a> site.</p>
<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can disable the acceptance of cookies at any time by changing the preferences in your browser. Please refer to your browser for information on how to disable and control cookies.&nbsp;If you choose to disable cookies on your browser, you may not be able to use some of the features or services offered on the Website or some features or services may not function as well. If cookies are enabled on your browser, you should assume that Automatically Collected Information is constantly being gathered by every website you visit, including the Website.</p>
<p><em> B. IP Addresses </em></p>
<p>When you visit the Website, we collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address to track and aggregate Automatically Collected Information. For example, we use IP addresses to monitor the regions from which our Website users navigate the Website.</p>
<p><strong> Use of Collected Information </strong></p>
<p>We may use both Automatically Collected Information and Personally Identifiable Information to help diagnose problems with the Website; to analyze statistical use patterns and demographic data; and to improve our Website, products, and services.</p>
<p>Please note that we may aggregate Automatically Collected Information and Personally Identifiable Information we collect as you use one of our Websites and/or Apps that we provide with Automatically Collected Information and Personally Identifiable Information we collect as you use other Websites and/or Apps that we provide.</p>
<p><em> A. Automatically Collected Information </em></p>
<p>We collect Automatically Collected Information in an effort to ensure that our Website will appear and function appropriately on your computer, to help us improve the Website, and so we may determine which website referred you to our Website.&nbsp;We may also use Automatically Collected Information to track what our Website users are looking at most frequently so we can recognize and deliver more of the desired features, products, and services. See other sections of this Privacy Statement for more information on how we use your Automatically Collected Information.</p>
<p><em> B. Personally Identifiable Information </em></p>
<p>We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to respond to your information requests or product orders, to provide information about products or services that may be of interest to you, or to provide information regarding MLC, upcoming events and workshops, new products, and other general information about our products and/or services. See the section below entitled “How to Stop Marketing Communications” for instructions regarding how to contact us to request that we stop contacting you for marketing purposes. See other sections of this Privacy Statement for more information on how we use your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p><strong> Who Has Access to the Information We Collect? </strong></p>
<p>Except in the limited circumstances stated in this Privacy Statement, we will not sell or otherwise transfer or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to any third party. We may share de-identified aggregated Automatically Collected Information without restriction.</p>
<p><em> A. Third-Party Service Providers </em></p>
<p>We may provide your Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information to third parties that provide us with services to the extent necessary and appropriate, in our discretion, to perform certain marketing or Website-related services on our behalf (e.g., improving Website-related services and features, directing mailings, fulfilling orders, conducting website analytics).&nbsp;These third parties are not authorized to use your Personally Identifiable Information or Automatically Collected Information for any other purpose and are required to keep the information confidential.</p>
<p><em> B. Merger, Acquisition, or Sale </em></p>
<p>We may transfer any and all Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information to a third party (whether affiliated or not), in the event of a sale or transfer of assets or other disposition of all or any portion of our business.&nbsp;In this event, we will, if allowed, use reasonable efforts to notify you when your Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information is transferred to any third party under this paragraph by posting such notice on the Website and/or by contacting you via the Personally Identifiable Information you have provided us, if any.</p>
<p><em> C. Required by Law </em></p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Statement, we may also use and/or disclose Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information, to any third party, without your consent and without notice to you, if we believe we are legally obligated to do so; if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect, establish, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our other customers, third parties, or our employees, property, or business.</p>
<p><em> D. Public Areas of Site </em></p>
<p>The Website may contain one or more areas where users can post content that will be viewed by other Website users. When you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on these areas for public viewing, the information may be collected, stored, used, and disclosed by other users of the Website. Such activities are beyond our control, and we shall have no responsibility for or liability regarding the protection or security of such information. Do not post information that you want to keep private on these areas of the Website.</p>
<p><strong> Securing Collected Information </strong></p>
<p>We use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial security measures to assist in protecting against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration of Personally Identifiable Information that is under our control.&nbsp;This includes the use of firewalls, encryption during transmission, vulnerability scans, and other security measures. Unfortunately, no data storage system, or system of transmitting data over the internet, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers, the means by which Personally Identifiable Information is transmitted between your computer and our servers, or any Personally Identifiable Information provided to us.</p>
<p><strong> How to Stop Marketing Communications </strong></p>
<p>If you choose to provide us with your contact information, we may contact you with offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. With each such offer, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future marketing notices. You may also opt-out of receiving future marketing notices by contacting us at <a href="mailto:MLCinfo@mathlearningcenter.org" title="Stop Marketing Communications"> MLCinfo@mathlearningcenter.org </a> . If you request that we not contact you for marketing purposes (either by using the unsubscribe mechanism or by sending us an email), we reserve the right to contact you for non-marketing purposes relating to your use of the Website or purchase of our products.</p>
<p><strong> Updating &amp; Correcting Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>If you have given us Personally Identifiable Information through our Website (such as by completing a form on our Website) or if you have given us Personally Identifiable Information by submitting a product order to us, you may update or change your Personally Identifiable Information by sending an email request to <a href="mailto:MLCinfo@mathlearningcenter.org">MLCinfo@mathlearningcenter.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you request that your Personally Identifiable Information be changed or deleted from our databases, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your Personally Identifiable Information from our databases, but see the section entitled “Retention and Storage” below regarding why we may still maintain some information.</p>
<p><strong> Retention &amp; Storage </strong></p>
<p>We may retain Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information in our databases until you ask us to remove your information from our databases, unless applicable laws require otherwise. Note that even after you ask us to remove your information from our databases, it may be impossible to remove some information, such as information tracked in our web server log files and information that may reside in backup files. We may also retain Automatically Collected Information even after you request that we remove your information from our databases, for use in the aggregate and to analyze and improve the Website. Further, even after you request that we remove your information from our databases, we may retain Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information to comply with any applicable law, rule, regulation, or guideline; to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability; and to allow us to enforce our contractual or other rights and to pursue available remedies and limit any damages we may sustain.</p>
<p><strong> Links to Third-Party Websites, Products &amp; Services </strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies only to the Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information collected through the Website.&nbsp;The Website may contain links to other websites (“Linked Sites”), products, and services that are not owned or controlled by us.&nbsp;We are not responsible for and have not reviewed the privacy practices of the Linked Sites, or the owners or operators of the Linked Sites, products, or services.&nbsp;The owners and operators of the Linked Sites, products, or services may have their own policies regarding privacy and security.&nbsp;You should review any Linked Sites, products, or services for their own privacy practices to determine what information about you may be collected and used when you use such Linked Sites, products, or services.</p>
<p><strong>MLC Login Areas</strong></p>

Areas such as these labeled “MLC Login” are reserved solely for use&nbsp;by MLC employees and independent contractors. You will not be able to log into these areas because you do not have accounts with authorized usernames and passwords. Please do not&nbsp;attempt to log into these areas of the Websites.</span></p>
<p><strong> Severability </strong></p>
<p>If any part of this Privacy Statement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision.</p>
