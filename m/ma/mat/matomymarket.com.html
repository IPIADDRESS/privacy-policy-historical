			<h3>MATOMY MEDIA GROUP LTD. PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
			<div class="pri_cont"><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #999999;">Last Updated: 13/1/2015</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Matomy Media Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries (“Matomy,” “we,” “us” or “our) is committed to protecting the privacy of users who access its website located at <span style="color: #ff0000;">www.matomy.com</span> (the “Site”), as well as the mobile and desktop websites of our media partners (collectively, the “Matomy Performance Network”). This Matomy Media Group Ltd. Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains the types of information that we gather and what we do with it. You agree to this Privacy Policy, in its entirety, when you: (a) access or use the Site; (b) register on the Site as either a “Publisher” or “Advertiser” on Matomy’s Performance Network; and/or (c) enter one of the sweepstakes, contests and/or other promotions offered by World 143™ from time-to-time (“Promotions”). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY IN THEIR ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE, REGISTER AS A PUBLISHER OR ADVERTISER OR ENTER ANY PROMOTION.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your California Privacy Rights</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to learn how your “personal information” (as defined in the Shine the Light Law, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83) is shared with third parties, what categories of personal information that we have shared with third parties in the preceding year, as well as the names and addresses of those third parties, please email us at: <span style="color: #ff0000;">privacy@matomy.com</span>; or telephone us at: +972 77 3606060.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Further, if you are a resident of the State of California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes, please email us at: <span style="color: #ff0000;">privacy@matomy.com</span>; or telephone us at: +972 77 3606060. Please be advised that where California State residents opt-out from permitting their personal information to be shared, such individuals may still receive selected offers directly from us, in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Information Collected on the Site</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. Collecting Personally Identifiable Information
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information obtained through your use of the Site, the Matomy Performance Network and/or entry into a Promotion which might reasonably be used to specifically identify you. The Personally Identifiable Information that you must submit in order to register as an Advertiser or Publisher, or to enter into a Promotion, may include, without limitation, your name, title, company name, mailing/billing address, email address, telephone number, Skype name, credit card information and/or bank account information. To the extent Personally Identifiable Information has been collected from you, you acknowledge that such collection is done on a voluntary basis to enable us to provide you efficient access to the Matomy Performance Network, Promotions and our other products and/or services.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. Collecting Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We automatically collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information when you access and use the Site. This Non-Personally Identifiable Information includes, without limitation, the type of browser that you use (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari), your IP address, the type of operating system that you use (e.g., Windows or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., Verizon, AT&amp;T). We use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information to help diagnose problems with our server, to personalize your Internet experience and to identify ways of making the Site better. We also may use this Non-Personally Identifiable Information in the aggregate to analyze Site usage, as well as to offer you products and services. This Non-Personally Identifiable Information is not linked to any Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. Identifying, Deleting, Modifying and/or Updating Your Information
At your request, we will inform you of what Personally Identifiable Information we have on file for you. If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, if you no longer wish to participate in the Matomy Performance Network, if you no longer wish to participate in our Promotions or if you no longer desire to access our other products and/or services, you may correct, update, amend or delete your Personally Identifiable Information by making the changes on your account page, by emailing our customer support department at: privacy@matomy.com or by contacting us by +972 77 3606060 or postal mail using the contact information listed below; provided, however, that we ask individuals to identify themselves and the Personally Identifiable Information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Please be advised that we may retain and use your Personally Identifiable Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. In addition, after you delete your Personally Identifiable Information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems. This deletion will not change or delete Personally Identifiable Information which may have already been shared with third parties, as permitted in this Privacy Policy. You will need to contact the third parties that contact you directly to change your preferences regarding their use of your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">5. Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Setting of Digital Identifiers
Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. To disable and reject certain cookies, follow the instructions associated with your Internet browser. Even in the case where a user rejects a cookie, he or she may still use the Site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We automatically use Digital Identifiers (as defined below) for tracking transactions, identification, security and the user characteristics as set forth herein. No Personally Identifiable Information is collected by use of digital identifiers and we use the information collected through such Digital Identifiers, which may also include information about the precise geographic location of the device, which may be collected when the user of the device permits such collection, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track movements on the Site and gather aggregate demographic information, about visitors so we can continually improve the Site, our performance network, in order to buy and sell online advertising, including interest-based advertising, using Real-Time Bidding and our other products and services.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Real-Time Bidding: Are complex technological tools or platforms that enable advertising buyers to bid in “real time" for the opportunity to show an online advertisement when a web page is loaded or an app is used.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also employ, and our third-party advertising partners employ, Digital Identifiers that help us better manage content and/or track transactions, collect data, serve advertising and provide related services. Unless expressly indicated otherwise, we do not tie the information gathered by Digital Identifiers to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Glossary:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beacons, Pixels and Tags: Beacons (also sometimes referred to as web beacons or pixels) and tags enable online advertising companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, on websites by allowing communication between a web browser and a server. A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page. A tag is a small piece of computer code that is run by the web browser.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mobile SDK: A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a beacon or tag (see Beacons and Tags above). The SDK is a piece of computer code that publishers include in their apps to enable ads to be shown and to enable related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, including by collecting and analyzing data which is available through the device on which the mobile SDK is installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cookie: A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server. By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Non-Cookie Technology: Today’s online world is becoming increasingly complex, with a proliferation of new devices, software platforms, online services and other technology. As such, cookies are not always available. Therefore, companies are using alternative methods to distinguish devices. For example, some platforms, such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Play Services for Android, provide unique IDs to be used for advertising. Most mobile devices are assigned unique identifiers that also may be used to distinguish devices. Additionally, it is possible to use mathematical techniques to make intelligent guesses about recognizing devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We do not link this automatically-collected data to Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Without deviating from the terms set forth above, including with respect to potential use of Non-Cookie Technology, the Matomy Performance Network uses the following: (a) unique cookies to identify web browsers and to store data for advertising purposes, including interest-based advertising; (b) unique cookies to track users' responses (clicks and conversions) to ads purchased; (c) non-unique cookies to store users' opt-out choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Please note the digital identifiers on the Site may change periodically and we will update this preference manager accordingly to have the most up to date digital identifiers included in this tool.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">6. Behavioral Tracking
Matomy uses cookies, pixels and other tracking technology on the Site for purposes of tracking users’ activities after they leave the Site. Matomy uses these tracking technologies to target applicable users with advertisements regarding Matomy products and services, and other products and/or services that Matomy thinks may be of interest to applicable users. In addition, third parties such as Google® may engage in a similar form of behavioral tracking of users that visit the Site. Users may be able to disable some, but not all, of this tracking activity by utilizing the “Do Not Track” setting or similar options within most major Internet browsers. In addition, if you would prefer to not receive targeted ads from us or from the partners that use our services, you can follow the instructions at the end of the applicable marketing message or email us at: privacy@matomy.com. To the greatest extent permissible under applicable law, we are not responsible for the tracking practices of third parties in connection with the Site.</p>

As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and applicable state do-not-call regulations.</p>
