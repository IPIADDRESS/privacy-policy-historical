<h3>Data Collection, Retention &amp; Sharing</h3>
<p>

Data is collected and used for the sole purpose of facilitating the
application/hiring process. The site only shares the application data
with the employers where you have applied for positions, and we don't
share them with any other employers or any other 3rd parties unless required by law.

</p><p>

Applicants have the option on their coversheet form to remove their
accounts and all files once all the jobs they've applied are finished,
or they can remove their accounts right away if they don't have any
current open applications.

</p><p>

Applicant accounts including all related files in the Portfolio and
reference letters will be automatically purged from the database 6
months (or 3 months if they have checked the 'off market' or 'remove my
account' option on they coversheet form) after all jobs they have
applied (if any) are finished, and they haven't logged in for 12 months.
 They can also contact us directly in case
they need to remove their accounts quickly for some legitimate reason.

</p><p>

Each employers can download all or any part of the application data
submitted to their job openings to their local systems for any purposes
they deem appropriate. Those downloaded data are no longer under our
control, and they are  governed by that employer's own policies. The
application data will no longer be available or complete once
the applicant accounts have been purged. The system keeps the snapshots
online for 3 years. A historical copy of application listing (name, contact &amp; degree info, application dates)
and EEO data are available for 6 years before automatically removed.
