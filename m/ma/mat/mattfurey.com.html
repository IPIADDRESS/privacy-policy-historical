<p>Matt Furey, Matt Furey Enterprises, Inc. and/or Gold Medal Publications, Inc. understands that your privacy is important to you. We are committed to protecting the privacy of your personally-identifiable information as you use this website. This Privacy Policy tells you how we protect and use information that we gather from you. By using this website, you consent to the terms described in the most recent version of this Privacy Policy. You should also read our Terms of Use to understand the general rules about your use of this website, and any additional terms that may apply when you access particular services or materials on certain areas of this website. “We,” “our” means Matt Furey, Matt Furey Enterprises, Inc. and/or Gold Medal Publications, Inc. “You,” “your,” visitor,” or “user” means the individual accessing this site.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy identifies how we treat your personal and non-personal information.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED AND USED?</strong></p>
<p>Non personal information is information that cannot identify you. If you visit this web site to read information, such as information about one of our services, we may collect certain non-personal information about you from your computer’s web browser. Because non-personal information cannot identify you or be tied to you in any way, there are no restrictions on the ways that we can use or share non-personal information.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED?</strong></p>
<p>Personal information is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, and fax number. We may collect personal information from you in a variety of ways:</p>
<p>✓ When you send us an application or other form</p>
<p>✓ When you conduct a transaction with us, our affiliates, or others</p>
<p>✓ When we collect information about in you in support of a transaction, such as credit card information</p>
<p>In some places on this web site you have the opportunity to send us personal information about yourself, to elect to receive particular information, to purchase access to one of our products or services, or to participate in an activity.</p>
<p><strong>ARE COOKIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES USED TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies, such as web beacons, to collect information on our website. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with us, a cookie helps Matt Furey, Matt Furey Enterprises, Inc. and/or Gold Medal Publications, Inc. to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Matt Furey, Matt Furey Enterprises, Inc. and/or Gold Medal Publications, Inc. website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the web site or to monitor how our users navigate the web site, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent were actually opened, acted upon or forwarded.</p>
<p>Third party vendors also may use cookies on our web site. For instance, we may contract with third parties who will use cookies on our web site to track and analyze anonymous usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and members. Such information is shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. These third parties use persistent cookies to help us to improve the visitor experience, to manage our site content, and to track visitor behavior. We may also contract with a third party to send email to our registered [users/members].</p>
<p>To help measure and improve the effectiveness of our e-mail communications, the third party sets cookies. All data collected by this third party on behalf of Matt Furey, Matt Furey Enterprises, Inc. and/or Gold Medal Publications, Inc. is used solely by or on behalf of Matt Furey, Matt Furey Enterprises, Inc. and/or Gold Medal Publications, Inc. and is shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. From time to time we may allow third parties to post advertisements on our web site, and those third-party advertisements may include a cookie or web beacon served by the third party. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information collected from you by third party ad servers. We do not control cookies in such third party ads, and you should check the privacy policies of those advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology before linking to an ad.</p>
<p>We will not share your personal information with these companies, but these companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you, and they may share your personal information that you provide to them with others.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Matt Furey, Matt Furey Enterprises, Inc. and/or Gold Medal Publications, Inc. websites you visit.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DOES Matt Furey, Matt Furey Enterprises, Inc. and/or Gold Medal Publications, Inc. USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>Matt Furey, Matt Furey Enterprises, Inc. and/or Gold Medal Publications, Inc. may keep and use personal information we collect from or about you to provide you with access to this web site or other products or services, to respond to your requests, to bill you for products/services you purchased, and to provide ongoing service and support, to contact you with information that might be of interest to you, including information about products and services of ours and of others, or ask for your opinion about our products or the products of others, for record keeping and analytical purposes and to research, develop and improve programs, products, services and content.</p>
<p>Personal information collected online may be combined with information you provide to us through other sources We may also remove your personal identifiers (your name, email address, social security number, etc). In this case, you would no longer be identified as a single unique individual. Once we have de-identified information, it is non-personal information and we may treat it like other non-personal information.

<p><strong>EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Protection Law</strong></p>
<p>The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) protection law describes how organizations who conduct business with individuals or entities located in EU (European Union) nations — including Matt Furey, Matt Furey Enterprises, Inc. and/or Gold Medal Publications, Inc. — must collect, handle, and store personal information. These rules apply regardless of whether data is stored electronically, on paper, or in any other manner. To comply with the law, personal information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely, and not disclosed unlawfully.</p>
<p><strong>The EU GDPR is underpinned by eight core principles. These state that personal data must:</strong></p>
<p>✓ Be processed fairly and lawfully<br>
✓ Be obtained only for specific, lawful purposes<br>
✓ Be adequate, relevant, and not excessive<br>
✓ Be accurate and kept up to date<br>
✓ Not be held for any longer than necessary<br>
✓ Processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects<br>
✓ Be protected in appropriate ways</p>
<p>Not be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), unless that country or territory also ensures an adequate level of protection.</p>
<p><strong>1. Policy Statement</strong></p>
<p>Every day our business will receive, use, and store personal information about our customers, affiliates, partners, and colleagues. It is important that this information is handled lawfully and appropriately, in line with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (collectively referred to as the ‘Data Protection Requirements’). We take our data protection duties seriously, because we respect the trust that is being placed in us to use personal information appropriately and responsibly.</p>
<p><strong>2. About This Policy</strong></p>
<p>This policy and any other documents referred to in it, sets out the basis on which we will process any personal data that we collect or process. This policy does not form part of any employee’s contract of employment and may be amended at any time. The company as a whole is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Data Protection Requirements and with this policy. Any questions about the operation of this policy or any concerns that the policy has not been followed should be referred in the first instance to the Data Protection Officer.</p>
<p><strong>3. What is Personal Data?</strong></p>
<p>Personal data is defined as data, (whether stored electronically or paper based) relating to a living individual who can be identified directly or indirectly from that data, (or from that data and other information in our possession). Processing is any activity that involves use of personal data. It includes obtaining, recording, or holding the data, organizing, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing, or destroying it. Processing also includes transferring personal data to third parties under privacy control conditions. Sensitive personal data includes contact info, address, session activity on the platform, IP location etc. Sensitive personal data can only be processed under strict conditions, and used for express purpose that it was collected for.</p>
<p><strong>4. Data Protection Principles</strong></p>
<p>Anyone processing personal data, must ensure that data is: Processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner. Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and any further processing is completed for a compatible purpose. Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the intended purposes. Accurate and where necessary, kept up to date. Kept in a form which permits identification for no longer than necessary for the intended purposes. Processed in line with the individual’s rights and in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. Not transferred to people or organizations situated in countries without adequate protection and without firstly having advised the individual.</p>
<p><strong>5. Fair and Lawful Processing</strong></p>
<p>The Data Protection Requirements are not intended to prevent the processing of personal data, but to ensure that it is done fairly and without adversely affecting the rights of the individual. In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we will only process personal data where it is required for a lawful purpose. The lawful purposes include (amongst others): whether the individual has given their consent, the processing is necessary for performing a contract with the individual, for compliance with a legal obligation, or for the legitimate interest of the business. When sensitive personal data is being processed, additional conditions must be met.</p>

<p>Transferring Personal Data Outside of the EEA: We may transfer any personal data we hold to a country outside the European Economic Area (‘EEA’) or to an international organization, provided that one of the following conditions applies:</p>
<p>The country to which the personal data is transferred ensures an adequate level of protection for the data subjects’ rights and freedoms.</p>

<p>The transfer is authorized by the relevant data protection authority where we have adduced adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the data subjects’ privacy, their fundamental rights and freedoms, and the exercise of their rights.</p>
<p>Subject to the requirements above, personal data we hold may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Those staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of contracts with the data subject, the processing of payment details and the provision of support services.</p>
<p><strong>13. Disclosure and Sharing of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We may share personal data we hold with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1159</p>
<p><strong>14. Subject Access Requests</strong></p>
<p>To these ends, the company has a privacy statement setting out how data relating to individuals is used by the company.<br>
Individuals must make a formal request for information we hold about them. Employees who receive a request should forward it to the data department immediately.</p>
<p>When receiving telephone inquiries, we will only disclose personal data we hold on our systems if the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>We will check the caller’s identity to make sure that information is only given to a person who is entitled to it.</p>
<p>We will suggest that the caller put their request in writing if we are not sure about the caller’s identity and where their identity cannot be checked.</p>
<p>Where a request is made electronically, data will be provided electronically when possible.</p>
<p>Our support team will refer a request to the data processing department or the Data Protection Compliance Manager for assistance in difficult situations.</p>
<p><strong>15. Changes to this Policy</strong></p>
