<strong><br>
Information We Collect:</strong><br>
<br>
The information that we collect is generally limited to personal  information about you that you submit on the Website. The personally  identifiable information that may be collected includes: your name;  address; email address; telephone number; fax number; information about  your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services;  and education level and interests. Although we are not collecting credit  card information at this time, we reserve the right to do so in the  future. To the extent that customer credit card-specific information is  collected by Mature Dating Only and any of its affiliates and/or  subsidiaries, said information will be kept in confidence and will not  be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies)  without the customer's prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, Mature Dating Only and its affiliates and subsidiaries  reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that they have  credit card information on file for specific customers but they will not  share this credit card information with third parties without the  customer's prior informed consent.<br>
<br>
Like most standard website servers, we use log files. Log files  track anonymous user information including, but not limited to, Internet  Protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider  (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and  number of clicks. This information is tracked in order to analyze  trends, administer the Website, track users' movements in the aggregate  and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The  information tracked via log files is not linked to personally  identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies:<br>
</strong><br>
The Website uses a “cookie” to assign a unique identifier to your  computer. The cookies we use are persistent files that your web browser  places on your computer's hard drive. Cookies may be used to help save  information on past activities and other preferences, so that you are  not required to reenter information each time that you visit the  Website, and to deliver content specific to your interests. No  personally identifiable information is gathered by the cookie.<br>
How We Use Your Information:<br>
