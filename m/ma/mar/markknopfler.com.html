<p>As set out in the table above, we are allowed to process your personal data for the following reasons and on the following legal bases:</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate interests</strong></p>
<p>We are permitted to process your personal data if it is based on our ‘legitimate interests’ i.e. we have good, sensible, practical reasons for processing your personal data which is in the interests of MarkKnopfler.com. To do so, we have considered the impact on your interests and rights, and have placed appropriate safeguards to ensure that the intrusion on your privacy is reduced as much as possible.</p>
<p>You can object to processing that we carry out on the grounds of legitimate interests. See the section headed “Your Rights ” to find out how.</p>
<p><strong>Contract</strong></p>
<p>It is necessary for our performance of the contract you have agreed to enter with us. If you do not provide your personal data to us, we will not be able to carry out our obligations under the terms of your contract.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Obligation</strong></p>
<p>We are subject to legal obligations to process your personal data for the purposes of complying with applicable regulatory, accounting and financial rules, health and safety and to make mandatory disclosures to government bodies and law enforcements.</p>
<p><strong>Consent</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we want to use your personal data in a way that is entirely optional for you, such as sending you email notification via the MarkKnopfler.com Newsletter. On these occasions, we will ask for your consent to use your information. You can withdraw this consent at any time using the “Unsubscribe” link present in the footer of every newsletter we send.</p>

<p>For example, if you are a member, we will keep your data for the time your membership lasts; then, we will keep that data if we need it to comply with a legal obligation or for research or statistics purposes, but if we do not need all the data you provided at first instance, we will delete the remaining data.</p>

<p><strong><u>No fee usually required</u></strong></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights)</p>
<p><strong><u>What we may need from you</u></strong></p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong><u>Time limit to respond</u></strong></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p><strong><u>What will happen if your rights are breached?</u></strong></p>
<p>You may be entitled to compensation for damage caused by contravention of the Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p><strong><u>Complaints to the regulator</u></strong></p>
