      providing a safe and secure environment for consumers, and in particular, ensure that our

      <p>This privacy policy applies to the Market Day site. The purpose of this marketday.com
      privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to marketday.com, what kinds of

      <b></b><p><b>Information About All marketday.com Visitors<br>
      </b>In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the
      numbers and frequency of visitors to marketday.com and its areas, very much like
      television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only
      use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our
      customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as
      appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, marketday.com
      uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our
      site are visited, and by how many people. Market Day cookies do not collect personally
      identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with
      other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen
      name or e-mail address is. </p>
      <b></b><p><b>Information About You</b><br>
      We may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service or when you order a product. We need certain information such as your name, billing address, credit card number in order to provide that service or product to you. We do not collect that information for any purpose other than to process your Market Day order. </p>
      <b></b><p><b>Email Addresses</b><br>
      When you register with marketday.com, we ask for your email address. This information is used to contact you with questions that we may have about your order. In addition, you may also 'opt-in' and elect to receive promotional information via email from Market Day. Your email address will also be provided to the Market Day Chairperson at your school, for the express purpose of enabling the chairperson to contact you regarding your order or to promote the Market Day sale at your school.</p>
      <b></b><p><b>For Market Day Chairs</b><br>
      These email addresses are to be used solely for the promotion of the Market Day sale at your school or to provide customer service for issues relating to the Market Day sale or products. Any other use is prohibited.</p>
