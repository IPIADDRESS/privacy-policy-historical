to inform you, as a welcome visitor to Market Day’s web sites, what kinds of

that information, whether we disclose it, and the choices you have regarding
our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Finally, please note

About All Market Day’s Online Visitors<br>
</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">In
general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the
numbers and frequency of visitors to Market Day’s web sites and each of its
areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people
tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective
data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of a site, so we can
improve that site to ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as
many of you as possible. We may share this non-personal statistical or
aggregated information about our customers with advertisers, business partners,
sponsors and other third parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
example, Market Day’s web sites use a technology nicknamed "cookies"
that tell us how and when pages in our sites are visited, and by how many
people. Market Day web site cookies do not collect personally identifiable
information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with
other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what
your screen name or e-mail address is.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If for any reason you wish to not take advantage of cookies you may have
your browser not accept them, although this will prevent you from ordering
products from our sites and may disable or render unusable some of the features
of Market Day’s web sites.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Information
About You</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><br>
We may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a
service or when you order a product. We need certain information such as your
name, billing address and credit card number in order to provide that service
or product to you. We do not collect that information for any purpose other
than to process your Market Day web site orders unless you “opt-in” to receive
promotional information via e-mail from a Market Day web site. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">In case you
change your mind or wish to update or delete personal information (such as your
zip code), we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data you
give us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You can do this by contacting
us at the contact points specified above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Addresses</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><br>
When you register with a Market Day web site, we ask for your e-mail address.
This information is used to contact you with questions that we may have about
your orders. In addition, you may also “opt-in” and elect to receive
promotional information via e-mail from a Market Day web site. For example, if
you register with marketday.com your e-mail address will also be provided to
the Market Day Chairperson at your school, for the express purpose of enabling
the Chairperson to contact you regarding your order or to promote a Market Day
sale or other applicable Market Day programs at your school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You can change your mind and “opt-out” from
receiving further materials using the process outlined below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">E-mail
addresses may also be collected at times other than registration; for example,
in connection with promotions. Certain of Market Day’s web sites may from time
to time send promotional information to collected e-mail addresses. If you wish
to ”opt-out” from receiving such material, please log-in at www.marketday.com
and choose “order online” from the menu at the page bottom, then choose “my
account.” You may then select “no” to receive e-mail newsletters. <b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

We collect the domain names of visitors to our web sites and the e-mail
addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail; however, we do not
disclose information about your individual visits to Market Day’s web sites or
information that you may give us, such as your name, address, e-mail address or
telephone number, to any non-affiliated companies for their personal use.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Please note that when you follow a link on a
Market Day web site to certain suppliers, merchants or retailers, such as via
schoolshare.com, Market Day may share with those persons certain non-personal
information identifying you as a visitor from the Market Day web sites. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">We may provide
your personal information to third party agents we have hired to help us
fulfill your order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, in
connection with your order, we would need to provide your credit card number to
a payment authorization service and your address to a shipping company to deliver
your package.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While we use all
reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, Market
Day will have no liability for disclosure of any information obtained due to
errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Market Day
reserves the right to disclose customer information in special cases, when we
have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing
injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our
rights or property, other Market Day web site users, or anyone else that could
be harmed by such activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We may
disclose personal information without notice to you in response to a subpoena
or when we believe in good faith that the law permits it or to respond to an
emergency situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
