		<h3>MARVELOUS DESIGNER PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
		<p>
			CLO Virtual Fashion Inc. (“CLO,” "we," "our" or "us") respects the privacy rights of its customers and protects the personal information collected, stored and used in connection with CLO services and websites (the "Services"). To further this commitment, we have adopted this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us. CLO includes its Affiliates, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership.
		</p>

		<h4 class="tit">1. SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy describes CLO’s collection and use of your personal information submitted and collected through our Services. The term “Personal Information” as used in this Privacy Policy includes any individually identifiable information about the user, including but not limited to name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or any other identifier of a user, and information concerning that user collected and/or maintained in personally identifiable form.
		</p>
		<p>
			BY INSTALLING, USING, REGISTERING TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OUR SERVICES, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not install, use, register to or otherwise access our Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, without any liability to you. We will notify you of any revisions to this Privacy Policy in accordance with Section 23 of our <a href="/footer/terms">Terms of Use</a>. Such modifications shall be effective thirty (30) days after posting unless stated otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will be deemed to have agreed to any such modifications by your further use of our Services after any such modification is posted. It is important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If you do not agree with the modifications, please discontinue use of our Services immediately.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to and from our Services may collect personal information about you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, those other advertisers or websites.
		</p>

		<h4 class="tit">2. INFORMATION COLLECTED</h4>
		<p>
			We may collect and process the following data about you.
		</p>

		<p>
			A. Personal Information
		</p>

		<p>
			When you access or engage in certain activities on our Services (such as registering a user account, downloading and installing application(s), making purchases, sending and/or posting user content, or sending us feedback), CLO may collect Personal Information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. 
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, if you make a purchase directly from CLO, it is necessary that you provide to us billing and financial information necessary to process your charges, which may include your postal and e-mail addresses.
		</p>

		<p>
			We may also offer you the option to complete a user profile that contains your Personal Information that is visible to other CLO users. Your user profile may include: a profile photo; username; your gender; and biographic details that you provide.
		</p>

		<p>
			B. Usage Information
		</p>

		<p>
			We collect details of your use of our Services and the resources that you access. Such usage information include information about how and when you access or use our Services.
		</p>

		<p>
			C. Technical Information
		</p>

		<p>
			We collect general technical data pertaining to you (such as information about the device you use to access our Services, IP address, operating system, browser type, program or system error messages and other system information).
		</p>

		<p>
			D. User Communication with CLO
		</p>

		<p>
			If you contact us or respond to messages and communications that we send to you, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
		</p>

		<p>
			E. Non-Personal Information
		</p>

		<p>
			For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Non-Personal Information" means information that does not directly identify you. CLO may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain Non-Personal Information that does not directly enable CLO to identify you.
		</p>

		<p>
			F. Cookies
		</p>

		<p>
			The Services may use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags, locally shared objects and web beacons to collect technical information and usage data, which may be linked and identified with your account. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that sites often store on a user's computer. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to login and use our Services.
		</p>

		<p>
			G. Mobile Devices
		</p>

		<p>
			If you access our Services on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, including tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers, including MAC Address, and IP Address. Certain aspects of our Services will create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number. We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, character name, geo-location or e-mail address. We may also access your contacts to enable you to invite friends to join you in our Services.
		</p>

		<h4 class="tit">3. USE &amp; SHARING OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h4>

		<p>
			A. Use of Information Collected
		</p>
		
		<p>
			CLO may use your Personal Information to send you messages about our company or our features, products or services, or promotional material from some of our partners, or to contact you when necessary, unless you have opted out of receiving such communications.
		</p>

		<p>
			CLO also may use your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, both individually or combined together, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development, for content improvement, for customer support and technical support, to manage and provide our Services, and to customize content and layout of our Services.
		</p>

		<p>
			Names, postal and e-mail addresses and phone numbers collected may be added to our databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events.
		</p>

		<p>
			CLO may enhance or merge the personal information collected by CLO with data from third parties in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems. 
		</p>

		<p>
			B. Sharing of Information Collected
		</p>

		<p>
			CLO does not sell or rent your Personal Information to third-parties for marketing purposes without your consent. However, you hereby agree that CLO may, without seeking further your consent, share your Personal Information with affiliate companies of CLO to provide you our Services or information about other services and promotional materials. In addition, CLO may share Personal Information with business partners that assist CLO in providing you our Services. CLO is committed to giving you a choice when your Personal Information may be used or disclosed for marketing purposes.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your personally identifiable information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control.
		</p>

		<p>
			C. Business Transfer
		</p>

		<p>
			In a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, dissolution (including bankruptcy), change of control, or a sale of all or a portion of our assets, customer information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event that CLO undergoes such transactions, including preparation of any of such transactions, we may share, disclose or transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor. Any third party to which we transfers or sells our assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.
		</p>

		<p>
			D. Compliance with Legal Obligations
		</p>

		<p>
			Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personal Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personal Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation.
		</p>

		<p>
			4. COLLECTION &amp; USE OF CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION
		</p>

		<p>
			Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from such children. Children under the age of 13 should not use or attempt to use our Services, and if you are under 13, please do not attempt to use our Services or send any information about yourself to us.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Further, in the event that CLO receives personal information that CLO discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, CLO will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner. Parents, who believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, may submit a request in writing to <a href="mailto:inquiries@marvelousdesigner.com">inquiries@marvelousdesigner.com</a> that the information be removed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please note that all persons under the age of majority in their jurisdiction are required to have a parent or guardian read and accept this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use on their behalf. Parents are encouraged to supervise their children’s use of our Services and to become familiar with the types of content available through our Services. Parents should oversee their children’s use of e-mail, forum and other online communications.
		</p>

		<h4 class="tit">5. SAFEGUARDS</h4>

		<p>
			CLO maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the personal information we collect and store about our account holders. Personal information collected by CLO is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible by authorized employees. In addition, our online store uses industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data quality). Before we allow web users to access their personal information, for example, we verify their identity by requesting that they submit information such as their username and password. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer personal information provide sufficient protection of such data.
		</p>

		<p>
			Your personal information may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the country of your residence. It may also be processed by personnel of our Affiliates and third party service providers who may operate outside the country of your residence. In such case, we will take reasonable steps to require such third party in possession of your personal information to take commercially reasonable security measures to protect the information.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, you acknowledge that: (a) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through our Services cannot be guaranteed; and (b) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party
		</p>

		<h4 class="tit">6. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES OR SERVICES</h4>

		<p>
			You should be aware that our Services may from time to time contain links to third-party sites, products or services. CLO is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites or services. If you are concerned about the privacy policy of a certain third party, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the site or service to which you link before you submit any personal information.
		</p>

		<h4 class="tit">7. ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

		<p>
			CLO makes good faith efforts to enable you to review, update or correct your personal information in CLO's possession. In order to do so, please contact our Privacy Policy Administrator at <a href="mailto:inquiries@marvelousdesigner.com">inquiries@marvelousdesigner.com</a>. CLO will need sufficient information from you to establish your identity and to verify your access request, and also to assist us in handling your request. Please note that even if personal information is changed or deleted according to your request, CLO may still retain some of your personal information to resolve disputes, enforce CLO user agreement(s), and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our Services.
		</p>

		<h4 class="tit">8. Deactivated or Terminated Account</h4>

		<p>
			Please be aware that even after your account is terminated or deleted, some or all of your information may still remain visible to others. A request to delete and/or termination of your account will not result in the removal of information collected and already put in aggregate form or information that cannot, in our sole discretion, be removed without undue burden to us. We are not able and/or obligated to remove any of your information from a third party provider or platform. Moreover, please be aware that even after you delete your account or your account is terminated, your information may not be deleted in its entirety from our servers and servers of the third party with whom such information have been shared
		</p>

		<h4 class="tit">9. OPTING OUT</h4>

		<p>
			If at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties and/or receiving information from CLO (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so by emailing us at to e-mail us at <a href="mailto:inquiries@marvelousdesigner.com">inquiries@marvelousdesigner.com</a>.
		</p>

		<h4 class="tit">10. INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY PRACTICES</h4>

		<p>
			CLO Services are operated and managed on servers located and operated within the Republic of Korea (“Korea”) and the United States. By using and accessing our Services, residents and citizens of countries and jurisdictions outside of Korea and the United States agree and consent to the transfer to and processing of personal information on servers located in Korea and the United States, and that the protection of such information may be different than required under the laws of your residence or location.
		</p>

		<h4 class="tit">11. Inquiries.</h4>
