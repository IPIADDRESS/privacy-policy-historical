<div align="center"><b>User Privacy Policy</b></div>
<p>
We want every user (you) to know how we collect and use information about you 
when you visit this Web site, which is produced by Minnesota Public Radio (MPR). 
We recognize the importance of privacy to visitors to any MPR Web site. This privacy 
policy ex plains what type of information is collected from you when you visit 
this and other MPR Web sites, and how we may use that information. </p>
<blockquote> <b>Contents</b><br>

<a name="info"></a> <b>Information We Automatically Gather When You Visit MPR 
Web Sites</b><br>
Like virtually all other Web servers, MPR's Web server automatically creates log 
files for each visitor who accesses our site. These "access logs" allow 
us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do <i>not</i> 
record a visitor's name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other 
personally identifying information. Rather, these log files may contain some or 
all of the following information: 
<ul>
<li>The date of the visit 
</li><li>The time and length of the visit 
</li><li>The path taken through the Web site 
</li><li>The browser being used 
</li><li>A list of files downloaded or viewed 
</li><li>The amount of time spent listening to audio files 
</li><li>The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine accessing our Web 
site* 
</li><li>Any errors encountered 
</li></ul>
<i>*Most Internet Service Providers use a "dynamic" form of assigning 
IP Addresses. This means that a visitor may have a different IP Address each time 
he or she visits an MPR Web site. Also, many Internet Service Providers, including 
America Online, use "Proxy servers" which provide even more anonymity 
for visitors.</i> <br>
<br>
We use this information to aid the technical administration of the sites and to 
better understand how each site is functioning for its users. This information 
may be correlated with your profile, if you have provided this data, to provide 
special "personalized" services. This information may also be used in 
aggregate form. <br>
<br>
We may track your visit to sections of our Web sites in order for some site features 
to function properly for you. In some instances, "cookies" or a similar 
technology may be used to update your registration records with session information. 
If you do not wish to accept a cookie from MPR's servers, you can adjust the settings 
on your browser accordingly. Refusing to accept cookies from the MPR server may 
result in some limits on the benefits that we can automatically provide as you 
enjoy the MPR Web sites. <br>
<br>
<a name="info1"></a> <b>Information You Give Us</b><br>
MPR does not collect personally-identifying information from MPR Web sites unless 
you choose to provide that information to us. Visitors under the age of 18 must 
obtain permission from their parents or guardians before sending any personally-identifying 
information to MPR. 
<blockquote> <a name="name"></a> <b>Name and Contact Information</b><br>
MPR may ask visitors (you) to provide certain personal information when you: register 
for a contest; sign up for an email list; request information; purchase products 
or services; contribute material that may be used on the Web site (e.g. recipes, 
program reviews); participate in a forum, bulletin board or chat; or use an MPR 
form to become a member of MPR. MPR tells you whether a specific piece of information 
is required at the time it is requested. <br>
<br>
This information may be used by MPR to: verify your identity; manage a contest; 
gather your editorial comments and feedback; contact you for additional information; 
and fulfill your order or request. MPR may also use this information for marketing 
and promotional purposes. By providing this information, you may receive occasional 
email from MPR or selected third-parties. <br>
<br>
When your name and contact information is to be used as part of an MPR-owned list, 
you will be informed of that fact, and you will be given the option not to be 
included on the list. (You may later elect to be removed from an MPR list by following 
the instructions provided on the MPR Web site.) <br>
<br>
To maximize the benefits MPR can provide through its network of public radio Web 
sites and through qualified associations, your name and basic contact information 
may be exchanged for consideration with select companies and organizations, including 
with other public radio stations and programs. These companies and organizations 
may attempt to contact you to promote a product or service which they offer. Such 
contacts from third parties will only be made with MPR's consent, and MPR will 
only grant its consent when MPR considers the offer to be of potential interest 
and benefit to our Web site users. <br>
<br>
MPR will not share, exchange, rent, or sell any of its lists to political parties 
or candidates for political office. <br>
<br>
If you do not want your name and contact information to be used in this way, you 
may indicate this at the time you provide the information. If an "opt-out" 
option is not offered, or you decide after you have provided this information 
that you d o not want MPR to share your information with any company or organization, 
you may also notify us in an email addressed to <a href="mailto:mail@mpr.org">mail@mpr.org</a>. 
MPR cannot remove your name from any third party's list; you will have to contact 
them directly. <br>
<br>
<i>The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) offers a Mail Preference Service that 
is designed to assist consumers in decreasing the amount of nonprofit or commercial 
mail they receive at home. For more information about this service, visit the 
DMA Web sit e at: <a a="" href="http://www.the-dma.org">www.the-dma.org</a> and click on the "Consumers" 
tab. </i> <br>
<br>
<a name="demographic"></a> <b>Demographic and Profile Information</b><br>
MPR occasionally conducts online surveys, sometimes in association with a contest 
or other offer. These surveys may ask you for demographic information such as 
ZIP code, age, education or income level. This information is used in an aggregate 
form to help us understand our audiences and improve our services. Demographic 
and profile information may be shared with selected third-party organizations, 
<i>only on an aggregate basis,</i> to describe the nature of our online audiences. 
<br>
<br>
<a name="cc"></a> <b>Credit Card Information</b><br>
When you engage in money-related transactions on an MPR site, you will be asked 
for a credit card number. All financial transactions take place only on secure 
servers. Electronic communication of credit card information is sent only in a 
secured or encrypted format. Your credit card information is saved, in an encrypted 
format, on internal systems that are either not connected to the Internet or are 
protected by advanced firewalls separate from the computers that serve MPR public 
sites. This information is not made available to any third party and is considered 
completely confidential. </blockquote>
<a name="members"></a> <b>Special Note for MPR Members</b><br>
If you use MPR's secure, online form to become a member or make a contribution 
to MPR, your name, complete contact information and all contributions will be 
passed directly to the MPR Membership Department. Your membership information 
will be protected in full compliance with the <a href="http://access.mpr.org/aboutMPR/docs/membership_list_policy.htm">MPR 
Member Lists Policy</a>. <br>
<br>
<a name="contact"></a> <b>Contact MPR</b><br>
If you have any questions about this privacy policy or any practices on the MPR 
sites, please send an email to us at <a href="mailto:mail@mpr.org">mail@mpr.org</a> 
or send a letter by regular mail to: 
<blockquote> Minnesota Public Radio<br>
New Media<br>
45 East Seventh Street<br>
Saint Paul, MN 55101 </blockquote>
MPR reserves the right to change this policy. Any changes to this policy will 
be posted to this page as soon as reasonably possible, so please check this page 
periodically. <br>
<br>
<a name="consent"></a> <b>Consent</b><br>
Your use of the MPR Web site constitutes consent to any policy then in effect.
