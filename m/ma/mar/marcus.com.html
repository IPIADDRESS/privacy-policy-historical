<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The personal information we collect about you comes primarily from the information that you provide to us during the course of your relationship with us. We may also collect information about your transactions and experiences with us relating to your use of the Site and/or the Products. In addition, depending on the Products that we provide to you, we may obtain additional information about you from third parties (for example, we may obtain your credit history from consumer reporting agencies or demographic information maintained by third parties).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">When you interact with the Site on a social media platform, we may collect the personal information that you make available to us relating to that platform, including your account ID or username and other information included in your posts.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Finally, in the provision of Products to you, information may be collected about you indirectly through monitoring or other means (for example, recording of telephone calls, monitoring emails and information collected through your use of the Site). &nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We only share your personally identifiable information with third parties as described below. In addition, we may share information that does not specifically and personally identify you, such as aggregated information, device identifiers or other unique identifiers to third parties. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><i>We will not sell information that personally identifies you to any third party for their own marketing purposes.</i></p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><i><b>Third-Party Service Providers:&nbsp;</b></i>We may share your personal information with non-affiliated companies that perform support services for us or in connection with any Product that you may receive from us (“<b>Third-Party Service Providers</b>”). Third-Party Service Providers that assist us are required to protect any non-public personally identifiable information that they receive from us and to use that information only for the purposes that we instruct or for other business purposes as permitted by law.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b><i>Law Enforcement, Legal Process and Emergency Situations</i></b>: Your personal information may be disclosed to third parties as permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations. Examples include responding to a subpoena or similar legal process, protecting against fraud and cooperating with law enforcement or regulatory authorities. We may also disclose your information if we believe it is necessary or appropriate to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our employees, customers or others, or to enforce our contractual rights.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b><i>Sale, Assignment or Change of Control:</i></b>&nbsp;In the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of any or all of our assets, some of the personal information that we hold may be among the assets transferred to a buyer or other successor. We may transfer to another entity or its affiliates or service providers some or all information about you in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, acquisition, sale of assets or any line of business, change in ownership control or financing transaction. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b><a name="CookiesandOtherTrackingTechnologies"></a>6.&nbsp;COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES&nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Like many websites, we use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. We may also use these technologies to record your preferences, track your use of the Site, measure exposure to our online advertisements, monitor traffic, improve the Site and make the Site easier to use. When you visit the Site, your browser may be momentarily directed to the website of an ad server, information security vendor or other Third-Party Service Provider. This re-direction process may not be apparent to you. These third-party websites automatically receive information about your device when this happens, and they may also collect information from your interaction with the Site including computer and connection information, standard web log information and ad information.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We partner with third-party advertising companies who also use these tracking tools to provide advertisements on the Site or other websites. These third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Site. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may also use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond the Site. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. The Site is not built to respond to Do Not Track signals. That means that, even if your browser is set to “Do Not Track,” our information collection and disclosure practices (including the choices that we provide to customers) will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy. You may, however, limit online tracking as described in the<b><i> Ad Choices</i></b> Section below.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b><i>Ad Choices:&nbsp;</i></b>You have choices to limit some tracking mechanisms that collect information when you use the Site. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of the Site may not function properly or may not remain accessible to you. In addition, you may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting or removing their associated cookies. Note that if you choose to remove cookies, you may remove opt-out cookies that affect your advertising preferences. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“<b>Google</b>”), on the Site. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Site, compile reports on the Site’s activity and provide other services related to Site activity and usage.&nbsp;The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor and any referring website. The Site does not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies.

<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Many of the third-party advertisers that place tracking tools on the Site are members of programs that offer you additional choices regarding the collection and use of your information. You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information by visiting our <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=gs01&amp;aid=gs01&amp;type=marcusbygs" target="_blank"><span class="rte-brand-accent-light _is-clickable">opt-out page</span></a> and the websites for the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank"><span class="rte-brand-accent-light _is-clickable">Network Advertising Initiative</span></a> and the <a href="http://youradchoices.com/aboutus.aspx" target="_blank"><span class="rte-brand-accent-light _is-clickable">Digital Advertising Alliance</span></a>, as well as the webpages for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads" target="_blank"><span class="rte-brand-accent-light _is-clickable">Facebook’s ad preferences</span></a> tool and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy" target="_blank"><span class="rte-brand-accent-light _is-clickable">privacy policy.</span></a></p>

<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Please note that opting-out of advertising networks’ services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using the Site or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.</p>

<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">This Privacy Policy provides a general statement of the ways in which we protect your personal information. We may, however, in connection with other specific Products, provide you with privacy notices, disclosures, policies or terms that supplement this Privacy Policy. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and any privacy notice, disclosure, policies or terms relating to any Product, the privacy notice, disclosure, policies or terms relating to the Product will govern.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b><a name="DoNotCallPolicy"></a>10.&nbsp;DO NOT CALL POLICY</b></p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Goldman Sachs Bank USA (“<b>GS Bank</b>”) does not place marketing telephone calls to numbers appearing on state or federal do not call lists (unless permitted by applicable law) or to the number of a person who has requested not to receive telemarketing calls made by or on behalf of GS Bank relating to the Products. If you ask not to receive telemarketing calls from us relating to the Products, you will be placed on our do not call list and will not be called during any future telemarketing campaigns relating to the Products. Any request to be placed on our do not call list will be processed within a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days. GS Bank employees involved in GS Bank's telemarketing campaigns receive training on how to use our do not call list, and how to document, process and honor requests to be placed on our do not call list. It is our policy to honor a do not call request for five (5) years from the time the request is made. However, some states have laws that require us to honor such a request for a longer period of time, and it is our policy to comply with those laws when applicable. Subject to applicable law, if you communicate with us by telephone, we may monitor or record the call. We reserve the right to revise this <i>Do Not Call Policy</i> at any time by posting changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
