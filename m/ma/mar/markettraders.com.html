We may also use cookie technology to track the site's aggregate page views, which helps us determine which features the user base seems to be most or least interested in. An important point: We do not track your individual usage patterns using cookies, nor do we use them to track your financial holdings or other personal preferences in any individually identified way.

Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration.</p><p>
