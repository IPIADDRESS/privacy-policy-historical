				<p class="font_OS"><strong>1. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT</strong>
</p>
				
				
				<p class="font_OS">Maropost Inc. ("Maropost") is dedicated to establishing a trusting relationship with its users, 

based on respect for personal identity and information, by promoting the use of fair 

information practices. This privacy statement covers all Web properties owned and maintained 

by Maropost, including but not limited to <a href="http://www.maropost.com">www.maropost.com</a>. Because Maropost wants to 

demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, we are disclosing: 
<br><br>
a. What personally identifiable information Maropost collects. <br><br>

b. How Maropost uses the information.<br><br>

c. With whom Maropost may share user information.<br><br>

d. Your choices about collection, use and distribution of the information.<br><br>

e. The safeguarding procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of 

information under Maropost's control.<br><br>

f. How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information. <br><br>

If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact Maropost Customer Support by email at <a href="mailto:support@maropost.com">support@maropost.com</a>.<br><br>
<strong>A) Information Collection</strong>
<br>

Maropost is the sole owner of the information collected on its web properties, including 

<a href="http://www.maropost.com">http://www.maropost.com</a>. Maropost collects information from its users at several different 

points on our Web sites.<br><br>
<strong>1) Registration</strong>
<br>

In order to use Maropost services at any level, and to access certain information or areas of the 

website (including various downloads, "Test Drives", webinars, etc.), a user must first complete 

the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as 

name, telephone number or an email address). We use this information to contact the user 

about services on our sites. It is optional customer to provide demographic information (such as 

income level and gender), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience 

on our sites. <br><br>
<strong>2) Order</strong>
<br>

When a user purchases a paying service, we request information from the user on our order 

form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and 

financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for 

billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the 

information is used to contact the user. <br><br>
<strong>3) Profile</strong>
<br>

We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our 

users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing 

preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable 

information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is 

used to tailor a user's visit to our Web sites, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to 

them. We do not share personally identifiable elements of your profile with other third parties. 

Your profile is shared in aggregate form only. <br><br>
<strong>4) Cookies</strong>
<br>

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. 

Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our 

site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once 

users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file 

stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be 

removed by following Internet browser help file directions. <br><br>

By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, 

thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The 

only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Persistent 

cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on 

our site. See the "Profile" section, above.<br><br>
<strong>5) Log Files</strong>
<br>

Like most Web sites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's 

movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP 

addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. <br><br>
<strong>6) Clear Gifs</strong>
<br>

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used 

to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear 

gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of 

this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. <br><br>

We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients have 

opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please 

see the Opt-out section.<br><br>
<strong>7) Children's Privacy</strong>
<br>

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we 

learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that 

information from our systems. Maropost encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here 

are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer: <br><br>

Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible 

adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc. Know the sites your kids are visiting and 

which sites are appropriate. Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's 

information is treated.<br><br>

Check out the FTC's site for more tips on protecting children's privacy online.<br><br>
<strong>B) Information Use and Sharing of Information</strong>
<br>

Maropost acts as a passive conduit for the distribution and receipt of its user's e-mail 

communications and therefore will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a user's 

private communications unless Maropost in good faith believes that such action is necessary to: 

(1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Maropost; (2) 

protect and defend the rights or property of Maropost; or (3) act under exigent circumstances 

to protect the personal safety of its users or the public. Users should also be aware (and hereby 

agree) that certain technical processing of and access to email messages and their content may 

be required to: (a) route the messages; (b) conform to connecting networks' technical 

requirements; (c) prevent or minimize disruptions to Maropost' services; or (d) conform to 

other similar requirements.<br><br>

Subject to the legal exceptions listed in the Privacy Policy, Maropost will not disclose to third 

parties the email addresses uploaded to our Web sites by our users for the purpose of using 

Maropost products or services. <br><br>
<strong>1) Communications from the Site</strong>
<br><br>

a) Special Offers, Free Trials and Updates<br><br>

We send all new customers welcoming emails and may communicate with them to introduce 

and explain their new services. Visitors to our website that are not customers but provide 

Maropost with contact information may receive emails from Maropost that contain information 

about our services, special offers and other promotions. Established users will occasionally 

receive emails containing information about us, updates on new service features, service usage 

tips, information about third party services or other Maropost services that are likely to be of interest to our users, and customers satisfaction questions. Visitors and Maropost users may 

opt-out of such notices. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. We may contact former 

customers to gather feedback on the services. <br><br>

b) Invoices and Account Statements<br><br>

We send all customers regular emails summarizing usage and credit card charges. These emails 

are a part of the Maropost service, and users cannot opt-out of receiving them, though they 

can deactivate their account. Information identifying the credit card is not included in these 

communications. 
<br><br>
c) Service Announcements<br><br>

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For 

instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an 

email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate 

their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. <br><br>

d) Customer Service<br><br>

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and regarding 

issues relating to their accounts. We reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users 

wishes.<br><br>

e) Surveys<br><br>

Periodically, our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys 

is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this 

information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name 

and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Survey information will be used 

for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of Maropost's services. Users' 

personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice 

and a choice to opt-out. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they 

may not use customers' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. <br><br>

f) Referral Programs<br><br>

Periodically, Maropost offers referral services, asking a user to inform a friend about our 

service. We collect the name and email address of the friend, and will automatically send an 

email invitation to the friend. Maropost stores this information for the sole purpose of sending 

this email and tracking success of the programs.<br><br>
<strong>2) Sharing</strong>
<br><br>

a) Legal Disclaimer<br><br>

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal 

information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is 

necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on 

our Web site. For example, Maropost may disclose personal information to law enforcement, 

other government officials, or third parties in response to criminal or civil subpoenas. 

Sometimes, these requests come from our third party Internet, telecommunications and service 

providers all over the world who supply the network required for us to deliver our services. In 

order to maintain the integrity of our network, we often cooperate with requests from these 

third party providers and/or requests from law enforcement or other governmental officials 

directed to these providers. <br><br>

b) Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable) <br><br>

We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This is not linked to any 

personally identifiable information. <br><br>

c) Third Party Intermediaries<br><br>

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These 

companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any 

secondary purposes.<br><br>

d) Business Transitions<br><br>

In the event Maropost goes through a business transition, such as a merger, or acquisition by 

another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most 

instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified prior to a change of 

ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the 

users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at 

the time of collection they will be given a choice not to have their information used in this 

different manner, as described in the notification of changes section, below. <br><br>

e) Spam<br><br>

Maropost does NOT share your email address externally. While we cannot be responsible for 

external communications received through Maropost services, if we are given notice that a 

Maropost Service is being used for spam, then we will deactivate that client. <br><br>
C) Choice/Opt-out<br><br>

Maropost users and visitors who do not wish to receive our promotional communications may 

opt-out from receiving these communications by clicking the opt-out link included at the 

bottom of every promotional message.<br><br>

Maropost users may not opt-out of receiving invoices and usage information, service 

announcements, and customer service communications, although they can deactivate their 

account.<br><br>
D) Links<br><br>

Maropost' Web sites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Maropost is not 

responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware 

when they leave our sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that 

collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information 

collected by Maropost' Web sites. Maropost has advertising and affiliate relationships with 

dozens of third party sites that drive interested parties to our sites. Information that is collected 

on these sites does not fall within the auspices of this policy. Maropost has Co-Brand 

relationships with some websites. A site is a Co-Brand of Maropost if it offers Maropost 

technology or services to its users under a different brand. The Co-Branded sites will have their 

own privacy policies specific to each site, and the user should read them carefully before 

registration. <br><br>
<strong>E) Safeguards and Data Retention</strong>
<br>
<strong>1) User Information</strong>
<br><br>

Maropost takes every precaution to protect its user's information. When users submit sensitive 

information via Maropost' Web sites, their information is protected both online and off-line.<br><br>

When our registration/order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card 

number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in 

the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our paid order form, the lock icon on the 

bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes 

locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. <br><br>

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security 

measures to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the 

sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need 

the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerks or a customer service 

representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers 

that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. <br><br>
<strong>2) Message Content Handling</strong>
<br><br>

We will store your personal Transmissions on our servers for a limited time and will endeavor to 

purge old transmissions from its servers when the expiration period has run out (up to 365 

days).We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your transmissions 

(as well as your personally identifiable information), such as firewalls and SSL technology. These 

are the same technologies that most websites use to safeguard credit card information and 

other personal information. However, that said, "perfect security" does not exist over 

telephone lines and the Internet and Maropost accordingly accepts only limited liability for 

security breaches.<br><br>
<strong>3) Data Retention</strong>
<br><br>

The time period for which we keep information varies according to what the information is 

used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. 

Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for 

no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is 

to be further processed.<br><br>
<strong>F) Supplementation of Information</strong>
<br><br>

In order for Maropost to properly fulfill its obligations to users and understand our customer 

demographics it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information 

from 3rd party sources. Maropost verifies the billing address on all credit card transactions and 

may obtain credit reports for some corporate customers. The information obtained from these 

third party sources is maintained in a manner consistent with Maropost' Privacy Policy.<br><br>
<strong>G) Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</strong>
<br><br>

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal 

address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or 

delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information by contacting Maropost Customer 

Service.<br><br>
<strong>H) Notification of Changes</strong>
<br><br>

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes in this privacy statement, 

and other places we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information we 

collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use 

information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.<br><br>

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different 

from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice 

as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have 

opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they 

will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In 

addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user 

information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site 

notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, 

who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our 

privacy practices.<br><br>
