          <br>
          It is Marvel's policy to fundamentally respect and protect the privacy 
          of visitors to our websites. <br>
          <br>
          We DO NOT extract individual information about you or your computer 
          at any time on our website. We will analyze information about our users 
          as a group to make our websites better, but you won't be individually 
          identified when we do this.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>We collect personal information like names or addresses, e-mail addresses, 
          age, etc., but only when you voluntarily give it to us in sweepstakess, 
          guestbooks or subscriptions. The most important thing we do with this 
          information is to fulfill the activity you signed up for, like notifying 
          winners or sending you our newsletter. This information is also used 
          for internal purposes, such as marketing and research. But, it WILL 
          NOT be sold, rented or given to anyone else unless we ask for and receive 
          your permission at the time we collect personal information from you.<br>
          <br>
          If you're under twelve years old, you should not be submitting any personal 
          information like this without your parents' permission. You'll notice 
          that when we have pages which ask for personal information we include 
          reminders asking kids to get parental permission before submitting. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We may occasionally ask, on a voluntary basis and with prior parental 
          permission, if appropriate, for personal information to provide to sponsors 
          of particular activities. This will be made clear in each individual 
          case where we have third-party sponsors and you will have the opportunity 
          to participate in these activities even if you choose not to give permission 
          to Marvel to share this information with our sponsors. <br>
          <br>
          <font color="#00FF00">MAIL'S IN!</font><br>
          Marvel uses automated e-mail systems to communicate with registered 
          members of our premium website, the Marvel Zone, to operate a weekly 
          broadcast the "Mighty Marvel Mailer" and to collect and answer 
          regular correspondence. Sometimes we don't have time to answer every 
          message, but we do read all of them!<br>
          <br>
          We try to make it easy to contact us and try give you easy instructions 
          on how to remove yourself from automated messages each time we send 
          you one. Please contact help@marvel.com with technical problems only.</p>
        <p> <font color="#00FF00"> SNACK TIME </font><br>
          We may occasionally use "cookie" technology to enhance your online experience 
          by making it easier for you to navigate through our pages or to make 
          an activity work better. <br>
          <br>
          Cookies are small files our website puts on your hard disk which allow 
          your computer to "remember" information for future use. We DO NOT extract 
          individual information about you or your computer during this process.

          <font color="#00FF00">LINKS </font><br>
          We try to make sure that when there are links off our site, they are 
          working and lead you to interesting, fun and informative areas. But 
          it's hard to guarantee what exactly is presented on other sites or where 
          links elsewhere may lead to. So, we can't be responsible when you leave 
          our site and we recommend that kids check with an adult before surfing 
          off to any new sites.</p>
        <p><font color="#00FF00">SECURITY</font><br>
          Marvel implements a variety of technologies to make our websites as 
          secure as possible against unauthorized access and to protect the information 
          you choose to provide to us. We periodically review and update these 
          measures. <br>
          <br>
          <font color="#00FF00">SOME OF US ARE PARENTS, TOO </font><br>
          We're sensitive about children consulting with parents or guardians 
          before furnishing personal information or ordering anything online. 
          We try to remind kids about this and we encourage parents to supervise 
          and join their children in exploring cyberspace. We're proud of our 
          website, believe that it is suitable for Marvel fans of all ages and 
          hope you enjoy it too. <br>
