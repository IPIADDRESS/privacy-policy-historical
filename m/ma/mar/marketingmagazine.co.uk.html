<h2>5. How We Disclose Your Information to Third Parties</h2>
<p>We may share your Information with third parties as specifically approved by you or under the circumstances described below.</p>
<h3>5.1 Disclosure for legal reasons</h3>
<p>We may disclose your Information if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Information to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce or apply or fulfil our terms and conditions and other agreements or protect the rights, property, or safety of our customers, our group companies or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>We use a number of third party organisations to help provide a professional service to our customers (i.e. fulfilment bureaus, call centres, and website designers). These organisations act as data processors and are strictly controlled in how they may/may not use your Information and we remain responsible for the protection of your Information.</p>
<h3>5.2 Promotions and Sponsors</h3>
<p>Some or all of the Information collected during a promotion, contest or poll (“Promotions”) may be disclosed publicly. It may also be shared with other third parties as disclosed and consented to by you at the time of collection or in the Promotion rules. These third parties may include providers of prizes in order to update you of your status of your prize or other fulfilment needs or a co-sponsor who may use your Information to administer the Promotion or for their marketing purposes, but only in conformance with your consent. We are not responsible for their privacy policy or practices.</p>
<p>When you participate in a Promotion, you are subject to any official rules for that Promotion, which may contain additional information about the specific privacy practices associated with the Promotion.</p>
<h3>5.3 Changes to our Company</h3>
<p>In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Policy.</p>
<h3>5.4 Message Boards and Chats</h3>
<p>We may make message boards, chat rooms, and other interactive forums available as part of our services. You should be aware that any Information which you post to these interactive forums or otherwise choose to make publicly available, may be disclosed and available to all users who have access to that portion of our website or services. By using these interactive forums, you agree that we are not responsible for any Information that you disclose or communicate in such forums, and any disclosures you make are at your own risk.</p>
<h2>6 Updating and Control of Your Information</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways in which you can control the collection, use, and sharing of your Information and update your Information and preferences.</p>
<h3>6.1 Opting-Out on Receipt of Marketing Communications</h3>
<p>When you receive marketing communications from us you will have the opportunity to "opt-out" by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the marketing e-mail or newsletter.</p>
<h3>6.2 Preference Services</h3>
<p>The Telephone Preference Service (TPS), the Corporate Telephone Preference Service (CTPS) and the Mailing Preference Service (MPS) allow you to choose to opt out of unsolicited marketing contact. However, if you are registered on any of the preference services, which are general opt-out registers, you may still receive marketing communications from us if you have given us your consent previously or if you subsequently give us that consent.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6.3 Contacting Us</h3>
<p>If your Information has changed or if you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us then you can amend your Information or update your preferences if you <a href="http://cms3.hbpl.co.uk/bulletins" _mce_href="/bulletins" target="_blank">click here</a></p>
<p>Please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>even if you delete Information, we may retain your Information in conformance with our data retention policy; and</li>
<li>we are not responsible for updating or removing your Information contained in the lists or databases of third parties who have been provided with Information as permitted by this Policy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7 Third Party Links and Services</h2>
<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website or you request a service from a third party, our Policy no longer applies. Your browsing and interaction on any other website or your dealings with any other third party service provider, is subject to that website’s or third party service provider’s own rules and policies.&nbsp; We do not monitor, control, or endorse the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties. We encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website you visit or third party service provider that you deal with and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us through our website or services and does not apply to these third party websites and third party service providers.</p>
<h2>8 Where We Store Your Information</h2>
<p>The Information that we collect from you may be transferred to, stored and processed at a destination outside the European Economic Area, (all EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Your Information may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers, for instance, for customer service purposes. By submitting Information to us, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary, including the use of the Model Contractual Arrangements as approved by the EU, or other contractual means to ensure that your Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy and the Act.</p>
<h2>9 Security of Your Information</h2>
<p>We follow appropriate security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your Information so as to prevent unauthorised access by third parties. We also require those parties to whom we transfer personal information to comply with the same. However, unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. So, we cannot ensure the security of your Information transmitted by you to us via the internet. Any such transmission is at your own risk and you acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible for any unauthorised use, distribution, damage or destruction of your Information, except to the extent we are required to accept such responsibility by the Act. Once we have received your Information we will use security procedures and features to prevent unauthorised access to it.</p>
<h2>10 Social Media</h2>
<p>10.1 Social networking sites, such as Facebook, Linked-In, among others, work with us as trusted third party partners. We also work with application developers who specialise in social media, so that we can connect with your social networks.&nbsp; We provide access to our Websites for third parties and business partners so that we can generate interest in our products and services among members of your social networks and to allow you to share product and service interests with friends in your network.</p>
<p>10.2 We do not control how your personal information is collected, stored or used by such third party sites or to whom it is disclosed.&nbsp; You should review the privacy policies and settings on any social networking site that you subscribe to so that you understand the information they may be sharing.&nbsp; If you do not want your networking sites to share information about you, you must contact that site and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to opt-out of sharing such information.&nbsp; Haymarket is not responsible for how these third party sites may use information collected from or about you.</p>
