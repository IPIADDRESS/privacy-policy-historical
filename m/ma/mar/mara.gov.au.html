        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <div class="steps">
            <p>This privacy policy applies to personal information collected by the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority (the “Authority”). The Authority is bound by provisions relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by various Commonwealth laws – particularly the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the “Migration Act”) and the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the “Privacy Act”).<br><br>This privacy policy is an overview, and does not provide details about all of our personal information management practices, procedures and systems. Further information can be obtained from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection’s (the department) privacy policy at the department’s webpage.&nbsp;<br><a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/pub-res/Pages/policy/privacy-policy.aspx" target="_blank" title="DIBP Privacy Policy">DIBP Privacy Policy<br><br></a></p>
<h3>Our role</h3>
<p>Our key objectives are to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>consumers understand their rights and agents understand their obligations under the regulatory framework;</li>
<li>only suitable persons are registered as migration agents, and unsuitable persons are refused registration or re-registration:</li>
<li>registered migration agents maintain appropriate knowledge and skills to enable them to provide accurate and timely advice to consumers:</li>
<li>registered migration agents are monitored to ensure the integrity of their conduct and the quality of the immigration assistance provided to consumers; and</li>
<li>consumers of the services of registered, or formerly registered, migration agents are provided with an efficient and effective complaints handling service.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our obligations under the Privacy Act</h3>
<p>This privacy policy sets out how we comply with our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988.&nbsp; The Privacy Act sets out 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) which regulate the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information and how individuals can access and correct personal information held about them.&nbsp; We are legally bound by the APPs.</p>
<p>The Privacy Act defines ‘personal information’ as</p>
<p>information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>whether the information or opinion is true or not; and</li>
<li>whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Privacy Act also places a higher standard of protection on sensitive information which means:</p>
<p>Information or an opinion about an individual's:</p>
<ul>
<li>racial or ethnic origin</li>
<li>political opinions</li>
<li>membership of a political association</li>
<li>religious beliefs or affiliations</li>
<li>philosophical beliefs</li>
<li>membership of a professional or trade association</li>
<li>membership of a trade union</li>
<li>sexual orientation or practices</li>
<li>criminal record</li>
<li>health information about an individual</li>
<li>genetic information about an individual that is not otherwise health information</li>
<li>biometric information that is to be used for the purpose of automated biometric verification or biometric identification</li>
<li>biometric templates</li>

<div class="step span-6 last"><h2><a href="#step2" title="Toggle Step 2" role="button" aria-controls="step-region-1-2">Part A — Collection, use and disclosure of information</a></h2><div class="step-content" id="step-region-1-2" aria-expanded="false" role="region" style="display: none;"><p>We collect personal information for purposes directly related to our functions or activities under the Migration Act and only when it is necessary for or directly related to such purposes.</p><p>Personal information (including sensitive information) will only be used or disclosed for the purpose for which it was collected unless the law requires or permits use or disclosure for another purpose or permission is given by the individual to use or disclose the information for another purpose.</p><p>Online, all interactions between the clients and us are protected by an industry standard 128-bit SSL encryption technology. Firewall technology is employed to help protect our internal systems and personal information against intrusion from the internet.</p><p>Personal information is stored in compliance with Australian Government security requirements. Access is audited and monitored by us and employees are trained on security rules and privacy issues.<br><br></p><h3>How we collect information</h3><p>Our usual practice is to collect personal information directly from the migration agents or individuals associated with the migration agent or directly from the person making the complaint. We collect this information in a variety of ways, including paper based forms, online (through our website as well as email), over the telephone and by fax. &nbsp;We also collect personal information from other sources. These include third parties or a publicly available source.&nbsp; Third parties include the department and other Australian government agencies, law enforcement agencies, legal services commissions, foreign governments, employers and members of the public who contact us with information.<br><br></p><h3>What we collect and the purpose of collection</h3><p>Our primary purpose when collecting personal information is to carry out our function of regulating the Australian migration advice profession in order to provide consumers of migration advice services with appropriate protection and assurance.</p><p>The Authority will collect personal/sensitive Information in connection with:</p><ul>
<li>an application for registration as a migration agent; or</li>
<li>a complaint about a registered migration agent.</li>
</ul><p>Set out below are the types of information we collect, hold and the purpose of the collection.<br><br></p><h3>Application for registration as a migration agent</h3><p>In order to process an application for registration as a migration agent we collect a wide variety of personal information. In general the collection of personal information includes:</p><ul>

<li>date of birth;</li>
<li>country of birth;</li>
<li>qualifications;</li>
<li>business information;</li>
<li>complaints history;</li>
<li>criminal record; and</li>
<li>information submitted by the applicant in support of their claims.</li>
</ul><p>In applying for registration as a migration agent, the applicant is taken to have given consent to collect personal information (including sensitive information).<br><br></p><h3>Complaints about registered migration agents</h3><p>For persons lodging a complaint about a migration agent:</p><ul>
<li>name;</li>
<li>contact details;</li>
<li>residential address;</li>

<li>receipts or proof of payments made to the migration agent;</li>
<li>correspondence from the migration agent that is relevant to the complaint; and</li>
<li>records from the department relevant to the complaint, such as correspondence regarding the processing of the visa application and the visa decision record.</li>
</ul><p>In the course of investigating a complaint, the Authority may also collect information from the migration agent about the complaint, such as the migration agent’s client file for the person making the complaint.</p><p>These supporting documents may include personal and/or sensitive information about the complainant, family members, authorised recipients, representatives or any other person relevant to the complaint.</p><p>Persons who make a complaint to the Authority are also required to give consent for the Authority to provide their name, substance of the complaint, and in some cases copies of all the documents they have submitted with their complaint, to the registered migration agent that is the subject of the complaint.<br><br></p><h3>Complaints about unregistered migration advice</h3><p>At times complaints are received about people who are not registered migration agents. The personal information collected may include:</p><ul>
<li>name;</li>
<li>contact details;</li>
<li>residential address;</li>
<li>date of birth;</li>
<li>main language spoken at home; and</li>

</ul><p>These complaints are referred to the department for investigation, however the electronic records containing personal information are retained.<br><br></p><h3>Monitoring the integrity and quality of the immigration assistance by registered migration agents</h3><p>In order to monitor compliance with the Code of Conduct for registered migration agents we may collect a variety of personal information.

<li>professional library subscriptions.<br><br></li>
</ul><h3>Maintaining our website</h3><p>The Authority operates a separate website to the department.</p><p>A record of each visit to the site is logged. Information is recorded for statistical purposes and is used by us to monitor the use of the site, discover what information is most and least used and to make the site more useful to users.</p><p>The information we log when users access our website includes:</p><ul>
<li>the person’s IP or server address;</li>
<li>the date and time of the visit to the site;</li>
<li>the pages accessed;</li>
<li>the person’s operating system;</li>
<li>the person’s web browser version and type;</li>
<li>the time taken to transmit information to the person; and</li>
<li>the previous internet address from which the person came directly to this website.</li>
</ul><p>This information is analysed to show broken links on our website, bottlenecks, and other site problems. We use this information to maintain the site for efficient use.</p><p>No attempt is made to identify the person through browsing activities except in the event of an investigation into the improper use of our internet facility or alleged interference with privacy, or where an enforcement body exercises a warrant to inspect the Internet Service Provider's logs.</p><p>The Authority does not collect personal information about you when you visit our website. More information is available about the Authority’s Online Security page.<br><a href="/about-us/freedom-of-information-and-privacy/online-security/" title="Online Security">Online Security</a><br><br></p><h3>Use of personal information</h3><p>We will use personal information for the purposes for which it was collected, and for secondary purposes where permitted by law or where permission is given by the individual.</p><p>Personal information is frequently used for a secondary purpose where enforcement-related activities are being conducted or in circumstances where a person would reasonably expect us to use the information and the secondary purpose is either directlyrelated to the primary purpose (for sensitive information) or related to the primary purpose (for other personal information). For example, the information provided for the primary purpose of processing an application for registration as a migration agent can be used for the secondary purpose of investigating a complaint or assessing subsequent applications.&nbsp; Secondary purpose can also include processing matters under the FOI and Privacy Acts.<br><br></p><h3>Disclosure of personal information and the purpose of disclosure</h3><p>Similarly, the Privacy Act allows us to disclose personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected. Personal information may be disclosed for a secondary purpose in certain circumstances. Generally, this is where a person would reasonably expect us to disclose the personal information for the secondary purpose, and the secondary purpose is either directlyrelated to the primary purpose (for sensitive information) or related to the primary purpose (for other personal information), for other purposes permitted by law or with the consent of the individual.<br><br></p><h3>Usual disclosures to other Government Agencies</h3><p>Personal Information about registered migration agents, or an inactive migration agent, is disclosed to the department on request in accordance with Section 321A of the Migration Act or the APPs.</p><p>Information provided in connection with an application for registration as a migration agent will be passed to agencies that are authorised to receive it. In accordance with section 290 of the Migration Act, the Authority must not register an applicant who is not fit and proper or not a person of integrity. The Authority must carry out checks to establish the facts surrounding this requirement. Personal details (such as name, address and date of birth) may be given to a contracted information broker to examine information held on the Australian Securities and Investment Commission’s public register relating to bankruptcy or corporate involvement.</p><p>Documents provided to support a registration application can be referred to the issuing authority (either overseas or in Australia) for authentication or to manage compliance obligations.</p><p>Other Australian government agencies also have power under Australian law to obtain certain personal information from us for the purpose of administering their portfolio legislation.&nbsp; Government agencies that we disclose information to include but are not limited to:</p><ul>
<li>Department of Immigration and Border Protection</li>
<li>Migration Review Tribunal</li>
<li>Refugee Review Tribunal</li>
<li>Commonwealth Ombudsman</li>
<li>Australian Human Rights Commission</li>
<li>Australian Taxation Office<br><br></li>
</ul><h3>Disclosure to nominated representatives</h3><p>Where a person has nominated a third party, such as a legal representative, a family member, Ombudsman, or a Member of Parliament, personal information will be disclosed to those third parties.<br><br></p><h3>Disclosures surrounding complaints</h3><p>Personal information about a complainant is only disclosed to the registered migration agent who is the subject of the complaint with the consent of the complainant.</p><p>Where complaints involve lawyer agents, personal information about the registered migration agent may be disclosed to the relevant Legal Services Commission.<br><br></p><h3>Authorised disclosure of personal information</h3><p>We have authority under section 287(1) of the Migration Act to keep a register listing individuals who are registered as migration agents. Section 287(2) requires the register to show the following information:</p><ol type="a">
