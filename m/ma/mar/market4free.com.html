If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you receive a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. If you choose to reject the cookie, you can still browse our Web but will not be able to use certain features of our Web and/or Market4free.com Services.

In addition, if the information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask you to give us additional information, or to answer additional questions as may be necessary to verify such information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Market4free.com uses personal information to fulfill requests for our Services or products; to process orders and better serve you with pertinent information, such as order confirmations and order status updates; to contact users regarding changes to the Web, Market4free.com Services, or to Market4free.com’s business; to conduct research and analyses; to improve our Services; to ensure the technical functioning of our network; to develop new service; and to customize advertising and marketing information and other&nbsp; content that you might see on the Web and/or Market4free.com Services. The personal information you provide will be stored and processed securely on our servers located in the United States and/or other countries. We may process personal information to provide our own Services. In some instances, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Payment Information.</em> Market4free.com does not collect, store or process any credit or debit card information. Any credit/debit card transactions are transmitted and processed through financial gateway(s). Such financial gateways may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read them. </li>
<li><em>Children.</em> If you are not of age of majority of your jurisdiction (“child” or “children”), you may not use the Web and/or Market4free.com Services. Children may not submit any information to us. Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to us. For that reason, we will not knowingly or intentionally collect or maintain information at our Web from children. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected any such information from a child, we will take appropriate steps to delete or otherwise remove it. Market4free.com is committed to protecting the welfare and privacy of children.</li>
<li><em>Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information.</em> Except as described below, Market4free.com will not willfully disclose, share, sell or rent your personal information to any individual or business entity outside of Market4free.com. In an effort to serve you better and improve your online experience while using the Web and/or Market4free.com Services, we may disclose your personal information in a responsible manner in the following circumstances: 	 
<ul class="square">
<li>We have your consent. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>We may provide personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We may also provide such information to our service providers who help with our business operations. &nbsp;</li>
<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is  	reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, court orders, subpoenas, other legal process,  	or enforceable governmental request, or otherwise comply with law; (b) enforce our  	<a href="/legal/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>,  	or investigate any potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect the rights, property or safety of Market4free.com, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that Market4free.com is sold, has its assets acquired or transferred, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, or merges or becomes affiliated with any other division, individual or entity, any user information owned or under the control of Market4free.com may be one of the transferred assets. In this event, we will notify you before any personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p><em>Sharing of Non-Personal Information.</em> We may share with some of our business partners or third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information. Such information does not allow them to identify you individually in any way.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Accessing and Updating Personal Information.</em> If you have an account with us, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information by logging into you account for editing purposes. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. We reserve the right to require you to obtain our specific approval before any changes of your personal information can be initiated. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be removed or the account to be closed before processing such requests, and we reserve the right to decline to process your requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. We do retain personal information from closed accounts in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations  and to enforce our <a href="/legal/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a></li>
<li><em>Choice/Opt-Out.</em> When you sign up for a specific Market4free.com Service that requires registration,  we ask you to provide personal information. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our Services,  in which case we may not be able to provide those Services to you. We will not willfully use or share your personal  information provided to us though the Web in ways unrelated to the ones described in this Policy without also  providing you with an opportunity to opt-out by <a href="mailto:e3">clicking here</a> or  otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. If we use your personal information in a manner different than the purpose  for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</li>
<li>
<p><em>(a) Security and Protection.</em> Your personal information is stored on our servers housed and maintained in secure locations. We treat data as an asset that must be protected. For that reason, we take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data using a wide range of tools, systems and procedures including, without limitation encryption (using Secure Socket Layer-SSL), passwords, multiple checkpoints, firewall protection, employee training and screening and physical security. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our Web and/or Market4free.com Services. You transmit all such information at your own and sole risk. Therefore, although we make our best efforts to ensure security and protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect that your personal information will always remain private.</p>
<p><em>(b) Protection of User Account.</em> Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose or share your password to anyone. It is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving the Web to protect access to your information from subsequent users. Remember, that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us and change your password.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Data Integrity.</em> Market4free.com processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process personal information that is necessary to provide or improve our Services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</li>
<li><em>Amendments.</em> Market4free.com reserves the right to modify or amend this Policy at any time by posting on the Web and/or Market4free.com Services. All such modifications or amendments shall automatically be effective upon posting. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy periodically. By using the Web, you agree to the practices described in the current Policy.</li>
<li><em>Contact.</em>&nbsp; Questions regarding this Policy or our privacy practices should be directed to Market4free.com  by email at: <a href="mailto:e3">e3@market4free.com</a>.</li>
