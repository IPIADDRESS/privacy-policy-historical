                                <p>In order to serve our customers, we collect personally identifiable information, like
                                names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and sometimes credit card information
                                when such information is voluntarily submitted by our visitors. We will only use your
                                personal information for the following purposes: (1) to deliver the products and/or
                                services to you that you have requested; (2) to validate your compliance with the terms
                                and conditions; (3) for content improvement and feedback purposes; (4) to reach you,
                                when necessary, regarding your use of the Website or product(s); and (5) for the few
                                situations described below to better serve you.</p>
                                <p>Partners: In some cases we may provide services or sell product lines jointly with other
                                businesses. For these co-branded offerings in which a third party is involved in your
                                transactions, we will sometimes share or jointly collect customer information related to
                                those transactions with that third party. On the co-branded registration pages we will
                                state who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs
                                its use so that you will know at the time you create your account exactly how your
                                information will be used. If you are registered with Company through a partnership and
                                you request to opt out of receiving promotional updates, in order to comply with the
                                provisions in the CAN-SPAM Act, we will also provide your email address to that partner
                                so that they may also discontinue sending you messages on behalf of Company.</p>

                                <p>Affiliated Entities: We may sometimes share or jointly collect information with our
                                parent entity and the wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliated divisions of our parent
                                company entity. Sharing this information helps us make your customer experience more
                                seamless and efficient by allowing us to improve our marketing efforts to better target
                                customer needs, streamline our processes and consolidate our backend business systems.
                                In the event we are ever sold or acquired by a third party, we would also transfer your
                                information as part of the business being sold to that third party.</p>

                                <p>Testimonials: With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name. If
                                you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us via one of the methods
                                listed in the Contact Section of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                                email from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time

                                because we hate spam as much as you do.</p>

                                <p>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>

                                <p>We also may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information to help us
                                make your experience more enjoyable, measure site activity to identify future
                                improvements that should be made, and compile aggregate data to help serve site visitors
                                better.</p>

                                <p>For example, we may use session and persistent “cookies,” session logs, web beacons,
                                GIF/pixel tags, banner ads, third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Google
                                Analytics), third party retargeting networks that may display our advertisements to you
                                on other sites that you visit to remind you about us, and third party networks that
                                serve user-requested emails (e.g., for a refer-a-friend email) to collect non-personally
                                identifiable or other aggregated information about site visitors.</p>

                                <p>To maintain our quality of service and to assist in the analysis of product performance,
                                we may gather data on connection information, including the timing and size of all
                                packets sent over the Internet during a session. The gathered information is used only
                                to ensure the highest quality experience possible when using our products.</p>

                                <p>We continuously improve our websites and our products and we utilize different third
                                party web analytics tools to help us do so. We are interested in how visitors use our
                                websites, our desktop tools, our mobile applications, what they like and dislike, and
                                where they have problems. Our products, desktop tools and mobile applications use
                                analytical tools to understand feature usage patterns, to enhance and improve your
                                product experience and offer you specific usage tips and guidance. In connection with
                                normal business operations, as well as to increase functionality and enhance your user
                                experience, this usage information may be linked to personal information that we have
                                about individual users. We maintain ownership of this data and we do not share this type
                                of data about individual users with third parties.</p>

                                <p>We may also conduct surveys and ask users to volunteer demographic information to be
                                used on an aggregate basis for internal market research, presentation to advertisers and
                                joint research projects with outside companies involved in product development. We use
                                such information to better focus our product and personalize the scope of services
                                offered to each individual user.</p>

                                <p>Cookies are text files that are used by your computer’s web browser to store your
                                preferences, and enable us to enhance your user experience with our Website. Third party
                                retargeting networks may also use cookies to display our advertisements to you on other
                                sites. You can learn more about how to opt-out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies
                                by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.</p>

                                <p>Emails or newsletters that we send electronically may use techniques such as web beacons
                                or pixel tags to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s
                                experience, such as the number of emails that are opened, whether they were forwarded or
                                printed, the type of device from which they were opened, and the location (e.g. city,
                                state, and county) associated with the applicable IP address.</p>

                                <p>Our Site includes Social Media Features (often called an “Open ID”), such as the
                                Facebook and Twitter buttons. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you
                                are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function
                                properly. These services will also authenticate your identity and provide you the option
                                to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to
                                pre-populate our sign up form. These Services may give you the option to post
                                information about your activities on our websites to your profile page to share with
                                others within your network. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the
                                privacy policy of the company providing them.We may track aggregate data about the
                                number of visits to this Website with an open ID, the number of items “liked” on this
                                Website, or items on this Website that you choose to share with a third-party social
                                media site.Other parties such as advertising partners and analytics companies may also
                                be collecting information about your online activity across various websites over time.
                                The information collected by those third parties may include identifiers that allow
                                those third parties to tailor the ads that they serve to your computer or other device.
                                Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based
                                “Do Not Track” signals other than cookies, we do not currently respond to “Do Not Track”
                                signals that are undefined.</p>
                                <p>Please note that you do have the option to configure most web browsers to NOT accept
                                cookies. However, be aware that disabling cookies may keep you from having access to
                                some functions or services on our Website or the web-hosted software that runs on our

                                <h2>2. Third Party Actions</h2>

                                <p>We do not control and are not liable for the actions of any third parties who we may
                                promote and/or link to from this Website. We pride ourselves in recommending quality
                                companies, but have no control over the actions of those third parties, the content they
                                provide, or their privacy practices. While we are not liable for any of the actions of
                                those third parties, you should feel free to give us feedback from time to time on your
                                experiences with any third parties to whom we work with so that we may enhance our
                                future service to all customers.</p>

                                <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>

                                <p>We do not knowingly intend to collect personally identifiable information from children
                                under 18 years of age. If your minor child has provided us with personally identifiable
                                information, you may contact us at the phone number or mailing address listed in the
                                section entitled “Contacting Us” if you want this information deleted from our records.
                                We will then make reasonable efforts to remove your child’s information from the
                                database that stores the information.</p>

                                <h2>4. IP Addresses</h2>

                                <p>We may use your IP address to help prevent fraud, to help diagnose problems with our
                                server, to gather broad demographic information, and to offer you products and services.</p>

                                <h2>5. Commitment to Data Security</h2>

                                <p>All information collected from you is stored in a technically and physically secure
                                environment. Furthermore, employees, contractors, and vendors who have access to your
                                personally identifiable information in connection with providing services for us are
                                required to keep the information confidential.</p>

                                <p>We use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, and we do everything we
                                can to protect user information offline. Unfortunately, no transmission over the
                                Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we take reasonable
                                measures to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the
                                information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>

                                <h2>6. Contacting Us</h2>

                                <p>If you need to contact us, you can email us at support@MarketHero.com, or call us at (214) 295-2623.</p>

                                <h2>7. Severability</h2>

                                <p>If any part of this Privacy Policy is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall
                                be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as
                                possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall
                                remain in full force and effect.</p>

                                <h2>8. Note To California Residents</h2>
                                <p>If you live in the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the
                                right to request that companies who conduct business in California provide you with a
                                list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during
                                the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.</p>
                                <p>Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either
                                an opt-out (often referred to as “unsubscribe”) or opt-in choice for use of your
                                Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for
                                marketing purposes, that the company may instead provide you with information on how to
                                exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>
                                <p>This Website qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy
                                and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your
                                Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are
                                not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your
                                Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
                                <p>If you are a California resident and want to request information about how to exercise
                                your third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address
                                with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal
                                mail). Please send an email to the Privacy Administrator at support@MarketHero.com.</p>
                                <p>All requests sent via email must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the
                                email subject line clearly stated on the actual request. For all requests, please
                                include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. Please include your zip
                                code for our own recordkeeping.</p>
                                <p>We do not accept requests via the telephone, mail, or by facsimile. We are not

These results are not typical and results will vary. The results on this page are OUR results and from years of testing. We can in NO way guarantee you will get similar results The sales figures stated above are our personal sales figures and those of students that worked extremely hard. Please understand my results are not typical, I’m not implying you’ll duplicate them (or do anything for that matter).
                                    I have the benefit of doing internet marketing for 7+ years, and have an established following as a result. The average person who follows any “how to” information gets little to no results. I’m using these references for example purposes only. Your results will vary and depend on many factors …including but not limited to your background, experience, and work ethic. All business entails risk as  well as massive and consistent effort and action. If you're not willing to accept that, this is not for you.</p>
