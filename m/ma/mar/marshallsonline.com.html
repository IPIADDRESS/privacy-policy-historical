            <p>When you use our Website, you may discover that it may contain links to other sites that are not owned or operated by the TJX Businesses. Also, links to our Website may be featured on other websites on which we advertise. These links are not intended to be referrals or endorsements of the linked or host sites, and the TJX Businesses do not warrant, represent or assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy, security, completeness or operation of any linked site (or any site contained in a linked site) or any host site, or the practices or privacy and other policies contained in any linked site (or any site contained in a linked site) or any host site. We advise you to familiarize yourself, therefore, with the specific legal, privacy and security information contained in any such linked or host sites. </p>
            <p>Our Website also contains links to other websites operated by the other TJX Businesses. We advise you to review the legal, privacy and security information for each such site to which you link, as the terms and conditions of use and the personal information you provide may vary from website to website. </p>
            <p>We may use third parties to serve our advertisements on other websites. These companies may use online tools such as pixel tags to report certain information (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our Website and the websites which advertise and feature links to our Website, in order to measure the advertising effectiveness of our ads.

We have instituted software firewalls to protect our servers and network. When your credit card information is collected through our Website during the order checkout process, it is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. We also use third parties to provide additional online technology during the payment process designed to help us protect against fraud. Unfortunately, no collection or transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such information. </p>
