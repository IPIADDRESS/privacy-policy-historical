            <p>Our Website also contains links to other websites operated by the other TJX Businesses. We advise you to review the legal, privacy and security information for each such site to which you link, as the terms and conditions of use and the personal information you provide may vary from website to website. </p>

We also use third parties to provide additional online technology during the payment process designed to help us protect against fraud. Unfortunately, no collection or transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such information. </p>
