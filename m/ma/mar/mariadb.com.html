        <p><strong>Effective: May 1, 2018</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect, when you access or use any of our websites and products, when you communicate to our staff, or when you otherwise interact with us (collectively, the âServicesâ).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how MariaDB collects, and processes your information, and what choices you have with respect to the information, as well as your rights relating to the collection and processing of your information.</p>
<p>When we refer to MariaDB we refer to MariaDB Corporation Ab, MariaDB USA, Inc. and other affiliates (âMariaDBâ or âweâ or âusâ) and the MariaDB.com or other MariaDB websites (âSiteâ or âSitesâ). In order to use MariaDB Sites, Services and/or to provide any personal information to us, you must accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these practices, you must not access or use any MariaDB Sites or Services or provide us with your personal information.</p>
<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
<h4>Personal Information</h4>
<p>In describing the information we collect, the term âpersonal informationâ refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, company name, phone number, email or postal address. In many cases we need this information to provide the products or services that you have requested. Unless necessary to provide our products and services, the amount of personal information that you choose to disclose to MariaDB is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it to us. In order to process certain transactions, we may also need to collect payment information from you (e.g., credit card information) which will not be shared with anyone outside of MariaDB, its affiliates and the financial institutions and vendors used to process payments. We do not intentionally collect any sensitive information, such as information concerning race, religion, health, sexual orientation or political beliefs. Please do not send any sensitive personal information to us.</p>
<h4>Voluntary Information</h4>
<p>We receive and store any information you voluntarily communicate to us in connection with your use of our Sites or which you may voluntarily communicate to us in any other fashion. You may choose not to provide certain information we request from you. However, if you so elect, we may not be able to provide our products and services, and you might not be able to access or take full advantage of the features and functionality of the Site. Once you initiate a voluntary transaction, we will ask you for certain information depending upon the nature of the transaction in question. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you request our products or services, we may collect your name, job title/rank, company name, address, mobile/phone number, social media account names, and email address and any other relevant information needed to contact you.</li>
<li>When you contact us concerning downloads or with general inquiries, we ask for the information we need in order to answer your question as quickly and as accurately as we can. We ask for your email address in order to be able to reply directly or to ask for additional information necessary to respond to your question.</li>
<li>When you submit a request to receive our newsletter, we ask for your email address to deliver the newsletter.</li>
<li>We may ask for your name, job title/rank, company name, email address, social media account, phone number, address and/or country to register you to attend our webinars or conferences upon your request.</li>
<li>When you participate in chat discussions or other public forums on the Site, any information posted in these areas of the Site becomes public information, and you should exercise care when disclosing personal information.</li>
<li>We may use information collected about you to protect our rights and to investigate and prevent fraud or other illegal activities and for any other purpose disclosed to you in connection with our Services.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Transferring Information Internationally</h5>

MariaDB will ensure we share data only with those organizations that satisfy an adequate level of data protection in line with applicable data protection legislation.</p>
<h5>Partners and Third Parties</h5>

we\u2019re excited to announce the first ever release of MariaDB Enterprise Server, which includes versions of MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4, 10.3 and 10.2. A lot of sweat and tears have gone into this release by the MariaDB Server team and I am extremely proud of what we\u2019ve achieved in a short period of time. Over the last year, since our last major release, our team has created two versions of MariaDB Server \u2013 a community version of 10.4 and a hardened version for enterprise customers that takes MariaDB to an all new height.<\/span>\r\n<h3>What is MariaDB Enterprise Server?<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past couple of years, we have been collaborating very closely with some of our large enterprise customers. From that collaboration, it has become clear that their needs differ vastly from that of the average community user. Not only do they have different requirements on quality and robustness, they also have different requirements for features to support production environments. That\u2019s why we decided to invest heavily into creating a MariaDB Enterprise Server, to address the needs of our customers with mission critical production workloads. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 is the first release of our new MariaDB Enterprise Server. It has all the features of MariaDB Community Server 10.4 but in addition goes through additional QA, testing cycles, ships configured for security and also includes additional enterprise features that our customers need. <\/span>\r\n<h3>New MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 Features<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 has a lot of new exciting features for everyone. Some of my favourites include instant ALTER TABLE operations and Application Time, which we\u2019ll talk about in more detail in upcoming blogs. In addition, we added an Enterprise version of the Audit plugin, Enterprise Backup and full encryption for the Enterprise Cluster. The feature I am most excited about is Enterprise Backup. It\u2019s a feature we worked on closely with customers in order to make backups with large databases work efficiently and seamlessly. The base setup behind the problem is fairly common \u2013 you have large tables and you want to take backups of them. The problem occurs when customers also need to be able to perform DDL on the tables (i.e. change the table structure: ALTER TABLE). The larger your tables, the longer both the backups and the DDL changes take, which can result in the two blocking each other. To solve this, we worked on an improved version of table locking that allows the backup process to incrementally escalate the locks as it gets further and further in the backup process. This allows DDL statements to work until the final stages of the backup process thus minimizing any time wasted on waits and at the same time making sure all operations finish with the data still in fully consistent states in the backups. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enterprise Backup is a good example of new innovation and, at the same time, collaboration with our enterprise customers.<\/span>\r\n<h3>Backporting<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The MariaDB Backup example is also a good story to illustrate another key benefit of MariaDB Enterprise Server: Backporting. Some of our customers have extremely large usage scenarios with hundreds of thousands of MariaDB instances. Deploying a new major version in this scenario takes quite a bit of time and planning, with potential application changes needed. We decided to take a closer look at our development process. When we have new features of GA maturity, we analyze the feature in detail to check a) if it fits a particular need that could be useful in older versions and b) whether it can cause instability in other parts of the code. If the analysis is favorable, then the feature could be backported to older versions of the server within the framework of MariaDB Enterprise Server. This is always done on a case-by-case basis, and Enterprise Backup is the perfect example where this made sense to backport. Both MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.2 and MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.3 also have the Enterprise Backup feature so customers who are not able to do a major version upgrade quickly can still immediately benefit from this new feature. In fact, we\u2019re working with several customers now to implement backported versions of MariaDB Enterprise Server to take advantage of features such as Enterprise Backup.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you to the entire MariaDB Server team for all their hard work. I am very excited about MariaDB Enterprise Server and about taking MariaDB to a whole new height where we\u2019re transforming open source into enterprise open source.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay tuned for more blogs that will review all the great features in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 in more detail.<\/span>","post_title":"What's New in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"whats-new-in-mariadb-enterprise-server-10-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-06-11 12:27:35","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-11 12:27:35","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/mariadb.com\/?p=11100","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11012,"post_author":"13","post_date":"2019-06-11 11:32:23","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-11 11:32:23","post_content":"","post_title":"MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"mariadb-enterprise-server","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-11-21 02:36:47","post_modified_gmt":"2019-11-21 02:36:47","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/mariadb.com\/?post_type=datasheet&#038;p=11012","menu_order":0,"post_type":"datasheet","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":6196,"post_author":"7","post_date":"2018-11-06 22:05:36","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-06 22:05:36","post_content":"","post_title":"MariaDB Platform","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"mariadb-platform","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-12-04 22:13:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-12-04 22:13:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":1339,"guid":"https:\/\/mariadb.com\/?page_id=6196","menu_order":0,"post_type":"page","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11037,"post_author":"13","post_date":"2019-06-11 11:29:13","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-11 11:29:13","post_content":"","post_title":"Your key to a better night\u2019s sleep: An introduction to MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"your-key-to-a-better-nights-sleep-intro-to-mariadb-enterprise-server-10-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-06-27 16:25:29","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-27 16:25:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/mariadb.com\/?post_type=webinar&#038;p=11037","menu_order":0,"post_type":"webinar","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}]},{"promoted_keyword":"10.4","related_posts":[{"ID":11100,"post_author":"627","post_date":"2019-06-11 12:15:03","post_date_gmt":"2019-06-11 12:15:03","post_content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we\u2019re excited to announce the first ever release of MariaDB Enterprise Server, which includes versions of MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4, 10.3 and 10.2.

A lot of sweat and tears have gone into this release by the MariaDB Server team and I am extremely proud of what we\u2019ve achieved in a short period of time. Over the last year, since our last major release, our team has created two versions of MariaDB Server \u2013 a community version of 10.4 and a hardened version for enterprise customers that takes MariaDB to an all new height.<\/span>\r\n<h3>What is MariaDB Enterprise Server?<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past couple of years, we have been collaborating very closely with some of our large enterprise customers. From that collaboration, it has become clear that their needs differ vastly from that of the average community user. Not only do they have different requirements on quality and robustness, they also have different requirements for features to support production environments. That\u2019s why we decided to invest heavily into creating a MariaDB Enterprise Server, to address the needs of our customers with mission critical production workloads. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 is the first release of our new MariaDB Enterprise Server. It has all the features of MariaDB Community Server 10.4 but in addition goes through additional QA, testing cycles, ships configured for security and also includes additional enterprise features that our customers need. <\/span>\r\n<h3>New MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 Features<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 has a lot of new exciting features for everyone. Some of my favourites include instant ALTER TABLE operations and Application Time, which we\u2019ll talk about in more detail in upcoming blogs. In addition, we added an Enterprise version of the Audit plugin, Enterprise Backup and full encryption for the Enterprise Cluster. The feature I am most excited about is Enterprise Backup. It\u2019s a feature we worked on closely with customers in order to make backups with large databases work efficiently and seamlessly. The base setup behind the problem is fairly common \u2013 you have large tables and you want to take backups of them. The problem occurs when customers also need to be able to perform DDL on the tables (i.e. change the table structure: ALTER TABLE). The larger your tables, the longer both the backups and the DDL changes take, which can result in the two blocking each other. To solve this, we worked on an improved version of table locking that allows the backup process to incrementally escalate the locks as it gets further and further in the backup process. This allows DDL statements to work until the final stages of the backup process thus minimizing any time wasted on waits and at the same time making sure all operations finish with the data still in fully consistent states in the backups. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enterprise Backup is a good example of new innovation and, at the same time, collaboration with our enterprise customers.<\/span>\r\n<h3>Backporting<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The MariaDB Backup example is also a good story to illustrate another key benefit of MariaDB Enterprise Server: Backporting. Some of our customers have extremely large usage scenarios with hundreds of thousands of MariaDB instances. Deploying a new major version in this scenario takes quite a bit of time and planning, with potential application changes needed. We decided to take a closer look at our development process. When we have new features of GA maturity, we analyze the feature in detail to check a) if it fits a particular need that could be useful in older versions and b) whether it can cause instability in other parts of the code. If the analysis is favorable, then the feature could be backported to older versions of the server within the framework of MariaDB Enterprise Server. This is always done on a case-by-case basis, and Enterprise Backup is the perfect example where this made sense to backport. Both MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.2 and MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.3 also have the Enterprise Backup feature so customers who are not able to do a major version upgrade quickly can still immediately benefit from this new feature. In fact, we\u2019re working with several customers now to implement backported versions of MariaDB Enterprise Server to take advantage of features such as Enterprise Backup.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you to the entire MariaDB Server team for all their hard work. I am very excited about MariaDB Enterprise Server and about taking MariaDB to a whole new height where we\u2019re transforming open source into enterprise open source.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span
