Our Privacy Policy describes the Personally-Identifiable Information and other information we collect from you and why; how we use this information; when we share this information with third parties; the choices you can make about how your Personally-Identifiable Information is collected, used, or shared; and the data security, accuracy, and access measures we have adopted to protect your information under our control from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.</p>
<div class="priv-pol-head">1.	<strong>Collection:</strong> </div><p>Personally-Identifiable Information will only be collected to the extent that Marc Jacobs deems reasonably necessary to serve a legitimate business or marketing purpose.  We collect Personally-Identifiable Information only if you choose to share such information with us. Marc Jacobs collects Personally-Identifiable Information from you when you register with our website, purchase products, or request other services that require information, registration, or subscription.  We may also keep a record of your product interests and purchases online and in stores. Whether or not you provide any of your Personally-Identifiable Information is your own choice. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to purchase products or access certain services, offers, and content on our website.  Like most websites, our website automatically collects and uses the data contained in log files. The information in the log files may include your IP (Internet Protocol) address, your ISP (Internet Service Provider), the Web browser you used to visit the website, the time you visited the website, which Web pages you visited on the website, and other anonymous website usage data.  We may combine such information with publicly available information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes. Please be aware that if you disclose Personally-Identifiable Information on website message boards or chat areas, that information may be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited communications from third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Marc Jacobs.</p>
<div class="priv-pol-head">2.	<strong>Notification:</strong></div><p>If different from the uses described in this Privacy Policy, customers and prospective customers will be notified (usually at the point where Personally-Identifiable Information is collected) as to the uses Marc Jacobs may make of the Personally-Identifiable Information collected from them.</p>
<div class="priv-pol-head"> 3.	<strong>Choice: Opt Out for External Distribution of Personally-Identifiable Information. </strong></div> <p>Customers and prospective customers will be given the opportunity to refuse permission for use of their name, address, or certain other information through an opt out mechanism.  If you wish to opt out of our direct marketing efforts or our sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing efforts, you may do so, at any time, by updating your communication preferences online at www.marcjacobs.com and clicking the "Unsubscribe” feature or by contacting us at: Tel: 212-965-5523, Fax: 212-965-5510, email:<a href="mailto:onlinestore@marcjacobs.com"> onlinestore@marcjacobs.com</a>. If you would like to access, verify, correct, update, or delete your e-mail address, mailing address or certain other information with us, please contact us the same way. Please note that it may take up to two weeks for your request to become effective and during such time you may receive e-mail notifications from Marc Jacobs.</p>
<div class="priv-pol-head">4.	<strong>Security:</strong> </div><p>Appropriate safeguards will be implemented in an effort to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of Personally-Identifiable Information about our customers and prospects. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through our website, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the website, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<div class="priv-pol-head">5.	<strong>Access: Correction.</strong></div><p>Customers can correct the Personally-Identifiable Information that has been collected from them by Marc Jacobs by resubmitting their information using the "Subscribe” feature located on the Marc Jacobs website or by contacting us at: Tel: 212-965-5523, Fax: 212-965-5510, email:<a href="mailto:onlinestore@marcjacobs.com"> onlinestore@marcjacobs.com</a>.</p>
<div class="priv-pol-head">6.	<strong>Onward Transfer:</strong></div><p>Whenever Marc Jacobs permits a third party outside of Marc Jacobs to access Personally-Identifiable Information, commercially appropriate procedures will be followed to help ensure that such information is used only for authorized purposes and by authorized persons in a manner consistent with the choices customers and prospects have made under this Privacy Policy, and that the security, integrity, and privacy of the information is maintained.  From time to time, we may share your information with outside third party servicers (such as mail houses) authorized to use this information solely to perform services on our behalf. In certain instances we may disclose Personally-Identifiable Information and other information when we believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities in order to protect Marc Jacobs or our customers or when we believe that the law or legal process requires such disclosure. We may also share or cross-reference, or cause to be shared or cross-referenced, such information, including your Personally-Identifiable Information, with unrelated companies you may be interested in so that the companies can directly market their products or services to you; provided, however, you may always opt out of such marketing efforts (as described in this Privacy Policy). We may also share Personally-Identifiable Information and other information with entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Marc Jacobs. Personally-Identifiable Information may be transferred as part of any merger, acquisition or sale of company assets, as well as in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which Personally-Identifiable Information would be transferred to another entity.</p> 
<div class="priv-pol-head">7.	<strong>Third Party Websites:</strong></div><p>Please note that our website may contain links to other websites that have their own privacy policies and practices. While Marc Jacobs will employ commercially appropriate procedures to help ensure that your information is only used for authorized purposes as described in this Privacy Policy, Marc Jacobs cannot make any guarantees with respect to the actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<div class="priv-pol-head">8.	<strong>Children’s Privacy Statement:</strong></div><p>Our website is intended for a general audience, and children under the age of 13 are not permitted to register with our website. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect Personally-Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personally-Identifiable Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.</p>
<div class="priv-pol-head">9.	<strong>Cookies: </strong></div><p>The MJ Website uses "cookies." We may also use cookies and other tracking code in emails that you receive from us. A cookie or other tracking code is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our products, services and advertising to suit the personal interests of you and others, estimate our audience size, assist our online merchants to track visits to and sales at our sites and to process your order, track your status in our promotions, contests and sweepstakes, and/or analyze your visiting patterns.  Certain of our service providers may use cookies and collect information on our behalf. They are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other service providers. In addition, in connection with the services that they provide to us, certain ones of our service providers may work with third parties who may use cookies to collect anonymous information to tailor advertising for you and others elsewhere on the Web. These third parties do not have access to any contact information about you. If you would like to opt out of accepting cookies altogether, you can generally set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. However, certain features of the website or our services may not work if you delete or disable cookies.</p>
