		   				This is a United States Web site and is subject to laws of the United States and the State of Maryland. Marriott will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to Marriott guests, visitors, associates, or property (including this site), or to others. As mentioned previously, laws related to personally identifiable information vary by country.

<br>
<br>
If you are a&nbsp;customer who resides in the State of California, you have the right to request from Marriott a list of third parties with whom we shared personally identifiable information about you for their own direct marketing purposes during the previous calendar year. Although Marriott does not share personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, many of our hotels, which are separately owned and operated by franchisees of Marriott, are permitted to use the personally identifiable information they receive from Marriott to market the Marriott hotels that they franchise. If you would like to request information about the franchisees that may have obtained personally identifiable information about you during the immediately preceding calendar year, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@marriott.com">privacy@marriott.com</a> or letter to Marriott International, Inc., 10400 Fernwood Road, Dept. 52.923.26, Bethesda, MD 20817.
