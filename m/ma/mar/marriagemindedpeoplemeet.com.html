        At MarriageMindedPeopleMeet.com, your privacy is a top priority. Your privacy is at the core of the way we design and build
        the services and products you know and love, so that you can fully trust them and focus on building meaningful
        connections.

        <strong>We do not compromise with your privacy.</strong> We design all of our products and services with your privacy
        in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product design and others to
        make sure that no decision is taken without respect for your privacy.

    <div class="text">
        <strong>We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data.</strong> Because we use many of the same online
        services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy
        policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language.
        We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!

        <strong>We work hard to keep your information secure.</strong> We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and

                such as basic profile details and the types of people you'd like to meet. We also collect information generated
                as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you
                access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.

                </li>
                <li>
                    When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your
                    personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos.
                    To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.
                    Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered "special" or "sensitive" in certain
                    jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs.
                    By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.

                <li>
                    When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform
                    such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your
                    debit or credit card number or other financial information.

                <li>

                <li>

                <li>
                    If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction.
                    Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of
                    service.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask
                    us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that
                    you give us in order to complete your request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the

                Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a "Do Not Track" ("<strong>DNT</strong>") feature
                that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked.  If a website that
                responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain
                information about the browser's user.  Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.
                For this reason, many businesses, including MarriageMindedPeopleMeet.com, do not currently respond to DNT signals.

                countries outside of the EEA. We use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or other
                suitable safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries.  Standard contractual clauses
                are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and
