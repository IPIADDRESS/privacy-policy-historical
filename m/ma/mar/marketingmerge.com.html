                        What Personally Identifiable Information do we collect?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The primary purpose of collecting information from you is to provide you with a
                        safe, smooth, effective, and personalized experience and to fulfill the transactions
                        you undertake here. We only collect information about you that we consider necessary
                        to achieve this purpose.</p>
                    <p>
                        Generally, we collect information in three ways. Some information is gathered when
                        you access secure areas within our website. This may include your name, email address,
                        street address, and phone number. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required
                        and which fields are optional. We may also collect personal information when you
                        contact us with questions or feedback. If you contact us, we may keep a record of
                        that correspondence or conversation to better serve you going forward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, you also will have to provide us with credit card and other payment information
                        necessary to complete a payment from you. We use a third party to process and verify
                        credit cards for billing purposes. This requires us to share your name, credit card
                        number, expiration date and billing address with the credit card processing company.
                        When processing a payment transaction we will also obtain information regarding
                        the amount of the payment and other transaction data. We may transfer or disclose
                        this payment information to a third party only to the extent necessary in order
                        to complete the payment processing.

                        use cookies, along with IP addresses, to measure your visiting patterns in the aggregate.
                        We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different
