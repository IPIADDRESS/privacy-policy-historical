<h1>PRIVACY <em>POLICY</em></h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 14, 2013</p>
<p>Margaritaville Enterprises, LLC ("Margaritaville", "we", "us" and "our") takes your privacy and safety seriously.  This Privacy Policy applies to www.margaritaville.com and any affiliated website on which this policy is posted (collectively, this "Site"). By accessing, visiting or using the Site, you expressly consent to Margaritaville's collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>1. Information You Voluntarily Provide To Margaritaville</h3>
<p>If you open an account with us, purchase products or services, sign up for a mailing list, send us an email, or voluntarily share information with us in any other way, we receive and store the information you provide.  You can choose not to voluntarily provide your information, but then you may Snot be able to use certain services or features offered through the Site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Registration, Site Offerings and Other Communications:</span>  We may gather certain information voluntarily provided by you, such as your name, user name and password, address, phone number, email address, and other information about your background or personal interests, through various means, such as: (i) the Site's account registration process and mailing list service; (ii) portions of the Site that allow you to post comments and/or communicate with other users, sign up for promotional offers, download screensavers or other software, or use any other services we may offer from time to time (collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "Site Offerings"); and (iii) through any communications you have with us.  In addition, we may request information about other users through our "tell-a-friend" or other referral service, which is further explained below in Section 5.</p>
<p>We may also request similar information at our physical locations, including our restaurants, retail stores, and resort properties.  However, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site.  Information about our customers that is collected at our physical locations may be subject to other terms, policies, or applicable local laws.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Online Orders:</span>  For the purpose of processing online orders, we may request contact information (including your name, address, email address, and phone number) and financial information (such as your credit card number).  </p>
<h3>2. Information That We Automatically Collect</h3>
<p>Like many websites, we use automated tools or mechanisms to collect certain information pertaining to your use of the Site and online activities.  Information that is automatically collected may be used to help us recognize you as a previous visitor to the Site, to serve relevant online advertising to you or to analyze trends and statistics (such as purchasing activities, the number of visits to certain webpages or websites, and similar data) to improve the services provided on our Site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Use of Cookies:</span>  We may collect information about you and your use of this Site through the use of cookies.  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on your computer and that your browser provides to this Site each time you submit a query on this Site.  Cookies collect information that may help us identify you (or your computer or network) and tell us how you accessed the Site and what parts were of interest to you.  This information may include your Internet protocol address, referring website address, browser type and the times you accessed the Site.    Internet protocol address is unique number that is assigned to each computer on the Internet.  Referring website address is the domain name or URL of the webpage you were visiting immediately prior to when you accessed, visited or use the Site.  Browser is the software application on your computer that lets you "see" websites (such as, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera and Apple Safari).</p>

SOME BROWSERS ALSO CONTAIN "DO NOT TRACK" FEATURES.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE SPECIFICATIONS OF YOUR BROWSER AND CONTACT YOUR SERVICE PROVIDER OR DEVICE MANUFACTURER.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Use of Web Beacons:</span>  We may place web beacons on pages of this Website and in emails we send to you.  A web beacon, also sometimes called a pixel tag or transparent GIF, is an object that is embedded in a web page.  It is usually invisible to you, but allows website operators to check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email communication.</p>
<h3>3. Information From Third Parties and Other Sources</h3>

Third-party websites and advertisers may use information collected about your Internet activity via their own cookies, web beacons, or other automated tools to assist them in delivering relevant ads to you.  You may be able to configure your browser to block third parties from tracking your activities, and some third-party companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their information gathering technologies.  We also encourage you to review the privacy policies of the different websites you visit. </p>
<p>We also receive information about users of the Site and/or other consumers and Internet users, either on an individual basis or in the aggregate, from affiliates, partners, research companies, or other third-party companies.

For example, if you want to post a comment to the Site you will need to have a Facebook account and be logged in to Facebook.  By logging in to a third-party social media service used to communicate or post a comment on the Site, you give us permission to access, store and use any information that you permit the applicable third-party social media service to share with us in accordance with the privacy settings that apply to your account with the third-party social media services you use to communicate or post comments on the Site.  </p>

<h3>6. How We Share Your Information With Third Parties</h3>
<p>From time to time, we may share the information we collect about you with our service providers, partners, affiliates, and third-party advertisers, if any.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Service Providers:</span>  We may use other companies or individuals ("Service Providers") to provide certain services to us or on our behalf, such as operating and supporting the Site and its services, analyzing data, or performing marketing or consulting services.  For example, we may use outside shipping companies to ship orders and outside credit card processing companies to bill for goods and services.  We do not authorize these Service Providers to use your information for any purpose outside the services related to the Site or the purpose for which the applicable Service Provider was engaged by us.</p>
<p>These Service Providers (such as companies used to process shipping orders and credit card payments) may, in turn, provide us with similar information about you that may help us  create your personalized user profile as well as other service enhancing features that we implement from time to time.    </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Marketing Partners and Third-Party Advertisers:</span>  From time to time, we may share information about you with our affiliates, partners, or other third-party companies to provide relevant advertising and marketing communications.  If you sign up for specific services that are provided by us and a partner, affiliate, or other third-party company, we may share information you provide to us with these third parties.  For example, our sweepstakes and other promotional offers may be partnered with or co-sponsored by another company, and if you enter the sweepstakes or sign up for the offer, your information may be collected by that other company.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive these communications, please refer to our opt-out process in Section 11.  </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">To Comply With Legal Process Or Protect Rights:</span>  There may be instances when we will need to disclose your information to: (i) protect or defend our legal rights, including without limitation, those of our employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety of users of the Site or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process, including subpoenas served on us.</p>

In the event of a bankruptcy, your information also may be transferred to a third party.  Although customer information generally is transferred as a business asset, it remains subject to the promises made in the pre-existing privacy policy. </p>
<h3>7. Children</h3>
<p>The Site is a general audience website and is not targeted at children.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13.  If you become aware that we have unintentionally collected information from someone under the age of 13, please notify us immediately by sending an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@margaritaville.com">webmaster@margaritaville.com</a> and we will delete the information.</p>
<h3>8. Links </h3>

<h3>9. Security </h3>
<p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to provide for the secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers by using encryption software.  We also seek to protect user information offline.  However, due to the open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that hackers or other unauthorized parties will not gain access to communications and transactions between you and us.</p>

<h3>11. Opt-out </h3>
<p>Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to the Site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, our order form has an opt-out mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but do not want any marketing material from third parties, can keep their email addresses off of our lists.</p>
<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our email newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out simply by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.  You may also unsubscribe at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:webmaster@margaritaville.com">webmaster@margaritaville.com</a>.  Type "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the subject line.  We will update your records as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days from your request.
