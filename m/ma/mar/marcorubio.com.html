information provided by marketing partners, and information appended
from data aggregators. Information collected may include, but is not

Web Beacons.</b></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><font size="2">A
web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image
on a web page (by using an &lt;img src="x"&gt; programming
function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also
be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often
in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual
with previously acquired information about an individual in a
database. &nbsp;This allows COMMITTEE to track certain websites an
individual visits online. &nbsp;Web beacons are used to determine
products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track
online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. &nbsp;For example,
COMMITTEE might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a
web beacon on the Third Party's website where cosmetics are sold.
&nbsp;When Jane, an individual listed in COMMITTEE’s database,
visits the cosmetic website, COMMITTEE receives notice by means of
the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and COMMITTEE
would then update Jane s profile with the information that Jane is
interested in cosmetics. &nbsp;COMMITTEE may thereafter present
offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane. &nbsp;In
addition to using web beacons on web pages, COMMITTEE also uses web
beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in COMMITTEE’S
database.</font></p>
