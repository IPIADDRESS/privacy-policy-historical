The privacy of children is important to us. We will not knowingly send direct mailings, e-mail or other correspondence to anyone who indicates that they are younger than 16 years old. Your children should always ask you for permission before sending personal information to Rogers Media or to anyone else. Any personal information we gather about children under the age of 16 would be used solely for demographic purposes.  Access to some of our websites may be prohibited to children under a certain age as specified in the website’s Terms of Service.

Cookies allow our  server computer to recognize your computer when you return to our websites, so  you don't have to re-register and so we can retain any preferences you may have  given us.

We may use it to help us display information in  the best format for you.<br>
                                            We may develop summary reports for advertisers, to help them  better understand our audience and provide advertisements that are more likely  to be of interest to you. For example, we may report total number of visitors  to our website in general or to specific webpages,  average length of visit, etc. No identifying data about individuals is  reported.<br>
                                            During your visit to our websites, we may record choices you  have made and use this to provide more customized content or advertising. The  data does not identify you and is not retained after your visit. This is  sometimes called "clickstream" data.<br>

The ads appearing on many of the Rogers Media websites are delivered to you using online advertising networks, and Adobe Media Optimizer technology.

                                            Rogers Media websites may make chat rooms, forums, message  boards and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any  information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you  should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. <br>

                                            Our websites use industry-standard security measures to  protect data against loss, misuse and interception by third parties. Our  security policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. However,  Rogers Media assumes no liability for interception, alteration or misuse of  information transmitted over the Internet.<br>

                                            Generally speaking, whenever you disclose personal  information online there is a risk that the information may be intercepted,  collected and used. That goes for information disclosed on message boards, in  chat areas - or even in e-mail. The Rogers Group of Companies is not  responsible if that information is intercepted. You transmit information at your  own risk.<br>
                                            Co-branded websites and third party websites and services  may be accessible through Rogers Media websites. Third parties may collect  information for their own contests or promotions, and may have their own  privacy and data collection practices. The Rogers Group of Companies is not  responsible for and bears no liability for these policies or actions.<br>
                                            You alone are responsible for keeping passwords and  information safe. Be careful and responsible whenever you're online.<br>

                                            Rogers Media uses a variety of contests and similar  promotions to increase awareness of our products and services. We generally  request contact information so that we can notify you if you are a prize  winner. As well, in some cases we may contact contest entrants with product  information. Contest entries generally include a way for you to indicate that  you do not want to be contacted based on the information on your entry. Because  contests may involve co-sponsors outside Rogers Group of Companies who have  their own privacy practices, it is always advisable to read the entry form and  contest rules before entering.<br>
