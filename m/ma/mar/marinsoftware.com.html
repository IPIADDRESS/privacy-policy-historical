This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
            <p class="bodycopy">By using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. “Processing” means using cookies on a computer or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S. your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Site and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the U.S. <br>
              If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@marinsoftware.com" class="bluebodylink">info@marinsoftware.com. </a></p>
            <p class="parahead1">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, [including, but not limited, to the Subscription Services,] to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.<br>
              If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you may be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Marin Software. This may happen in a number of instances, such as when [you sign up for a free trial of the Subscription Services, or] you download materials such as “white papers” from the Site, if you desire to receive our newsletter or other marketing materials and information, or if you wish to enter into a contests, sweepstakes or promotions (collectively <span class="italicboldbodycopy">“Promotions”</span>) we provide via the Site. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your user name, password, company title (if applicable), email address, physical address and telephone number. [If you decide to become a paying customer for the Subscription Services, we may collect additional information from you, such as your credit card number or other billing information.] If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you. In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services[, including but not limited to our Subscription Services.] If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a web site <span class="italicboldbodycopy">(“Log Data”)</span>. This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. Except in the instances described herein, we do not use this information to identify you personally. We use it to monitor the use of the Site and of any services or Promotions we provide via the Site [including our Subscription Services], and for the Site’s technical administration.   We may also ask you for information about your online search habits and how much you or your company has spent on search services over a given period of time. This information which on its own cannot be used to identify you directly, would be considered a part of your personally identifiable information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example,&nbsp;combining it with your name such that you can be identified.)  But the same pieces of information are considered non-identifying information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example,&nbsp;your viewing preferences).  We may combine your personally identifiable information with non-identifying information and aggregate it with information collected from Site users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the services and Promotions we provide via the Site and to analyze and understand how our Site, services and Promotions are used. </p>
            <p class="parahead1">COOKIES</p>
            <p class="bodycopy">Like many web sites, we also use “cookie” technology to collect additional web site usage data and to improve the Site and any services or Promotions we provide via the Site [including our Subscription Services]. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. However, IP addresses are collected by the use of cookies. Marin Software may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and with and any services or Promotions we provide via the Site [including our Subscription Services], to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve usability and performance of the Site. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site.

Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the web sites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site.</p>

These other web sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you through the Site. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other web sites you visit. </p>
