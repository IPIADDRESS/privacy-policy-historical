        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><em>This Privacy Policy is effective as of November 20, 2008</em></p>
<p>Marin Software Incorporated (“Marin Software,” “we,” “us”)  provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and  procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally  identifiable information received from users of this web site, located  at <a href="http://www.marinsoftware.com" target="_self">www.marinsoftware.com</a> (“Site”).   Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the information  that we collect through this Site [as well as through the paid search  management software application available on this Site (“Subscription Services”)].  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We  will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by  posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult  this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
<p>By using our Site you are consenting to  our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy  now and as amended by us. “Processing” means using cookies on a computer  or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited  to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing  information, all of which activities will take place in the United  States. If you reside outside the U.S. your personally identifiable  information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored  there under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Site and providing  information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in,  the U.S.<br>
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy  Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please  contact us at <a href="mailto:info@marinsoftware.com">info@marinsoftware.com. </a></p>
<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h3>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting  personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product  and services made available through the Site, [including, but not  limited, to the Subscription Services,] to communicate with you, and to  manage your registered user account, if you have one.</p>
<p>If you desire to have access to certain restricted  sections of the Site, you may be required to become a registered user,  and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Marin  Software. This may happen in a number of instances, such as when [you  sign up for a free trial of the Subscription Services, or] you download  materials such as “white papers” from the Site, if you desire to receive  our newsletter or other marketing materials and information, or if you  wish to enter into a contests, sweepstakes or promotions (collectively “Promotions”)  we provide via the Site. Personally identifiable information that we  may collect in such instances may include your user name, password,  company title (if applicable), email address, physical address and  telephone number. [If you decide to become a paying customer for the  Subscription Services, we may collect additional information from you,  such as your credit card number or other billing information.] If you  contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your  contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address,  and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond  to you. In addition, we may use your contact information to market to  you, and provide you with information about, our products and services[,  including but not limited to our Subscription Services.] If you decide  at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or  communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions  provided in any of the communications.</p>
<p>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a web site (“Log Data”).  This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser  type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit,  the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click.  For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider  the IP address will be different every time you log on. Except in the  instances described herein, we do not use this information to identify  you personally. We use it to monitor the use of the Site and of any  services or Promotions we provide via the Site [including our  Subscription Services], and for the Site’s technical administration.    We may also ask you for information about your online search habits and  how much you or your company has spent on search services over a given  period of time. This information which on its own cannot be used to  identify you directly, would be considered a part of your personally  identifiable information if it were combined with other identifiers (for  example,&nbsp;combining it with your name such that you can be identified.)   But the same pieces of information are considered non-identifying  information when they are taken alone or combined only with other  non-identifying information (for example,&nbsp;your viewing preferences).  We  may combine your personally identifiable information with  non-identifying information and aggregate it with information collected  from Site users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to  improve the quality and value of the services and Promotions we provide  via the Site and to analyze and understand how our Site, services and  Promotions are used.</p>
<h3>COOKIES</h3>
<p>Like many web sites, we also use  “cookie” technology to collect additional web site usage data and to  improve the Site and any services or Promotions we provide via the Site  [including our Subscription Services]. A cookie is a small data file  that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to  collect personally identifiable information. However, IP addresses are  collected by the use of cookies. Marin Software may use both session  cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact  with the Site and with and any services or Promotions we provide via the  Site [including our Subscription Services], to monitor aggregate usage  by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve  usability and performance of the Site. A session cookie enables certain  features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer  when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains  after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on  subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by  following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers  automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing  its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting  a cookie from the web sites you visit. If you do not accept cookies,  however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site.</p>

<p>Service Providers.  We may engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and  provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and  maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and  direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable  information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary  to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant  to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to  maintain the privacy and security of your data.</p>

We encourage you to read the privacy policies or  statements of the other web sites you visit.</p>
