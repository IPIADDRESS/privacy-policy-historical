	<p>Last  Updated: February 16, 2011</p>
    <p>Marketingshow.com  strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to  provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally  Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone  number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell,  barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. “Period.”
    </p>
    <br><p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong> <br>
      How we  collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the  activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For  example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access  to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as  newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you  participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and  other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Marketingshow.com also  collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that  may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your  Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold  information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user  name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each  time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular  advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we  may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can  choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser  to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain  portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,  and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your  preferences.
    </p>
    <br><p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong>
      <br>Like other  Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more  individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not  share your information with anyone. Aggregated  Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in  many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns  with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and  services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most  attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our  advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any  Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you  individually.
    </p>
    <br><p>We may use  Personally Identifiable Information collected on Marketingshow.com to  communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our  Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by Marketingshow.com  and other topics we think you might find of interest. Personally Identifiable Information collected by Marketingshow.com may also be  used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,  troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of  sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third  parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web  hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your  information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we  continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other  companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among  the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a  court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so  by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or  to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please  note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
    </p>
    <br><p>Affiliated  sites, linked sites and advertisements
    </p>
    <p>Marketingshow.com  expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our  users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners,  advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our  site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.  For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of  a frame on Marketingshow.com pages, certain content that is actually created or  hosted by a third party. Also, through Marketingshow.com you may be introduced  to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or  sweepstakes offered by other parties. Marketingshow.com is not responsible for  the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable  privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature  or page operated by a third party.
    </p>
    <br><p>While on  our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use  cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or  retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by  third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine  whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features  available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use  cookies or other technology to gather information. Marketingshow.com does not  control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting  information, and are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third  parties. You should  also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable  Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed  publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge  and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.  Such activities are beyond the control of Marketingshow.com and this policy.

      Marketingshow.com  does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from  or about children under 13 except as permitted by law.

Your continued use of our site following the posting  of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information  collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the  rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.<br>
    </p>
    <br><p><strong>Governing law</strong>
      This policy  and the use of these Sites are governed by Minnesota law. If a dispute arises  under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the help of a  mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Minnesota. Any costs  and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared  equally by each of us.

Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered  in any court with jurisdiction to do so.
      <br>Marketingshow.com  is controlled, operated and administered entirely within Minnesota. This  statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not  create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</p>
