        <h1>MarketingZone.com Privacy Policy      </h1>
        <p>At MarketingZone, we care a lot about privacy. Not only because it’s good marketing, but because it’s the right thing to do. We know that asking you to share personal information with us is asking you to trust us. We intend to earn that trust. Following is our basic privacy philosophy, outlining how your information will be used when you provide us with your email address. Please note that the current site is a placeholder only. By providing us with your email address now you will be notified immediately when the site is launched. At that time we may ask for additional personally identifiable, or non-identifiable information if you desire to engage in some of the available site activities. Our privacy policy will be updated accordingly at that time.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Email Privacy Overview</strong><br>
        MarketingZone will not rent, sell, barter or otherwise give out your email address as part of a list for the purposes of a ‘blast’ from a third party. Your email address will be kept in databases which we have evaluated for security, to which only authorized employees of MarketingZone, and our official vendors will have access. </p>
        <p><strong>Our Email Newsletter Program</strong><br>
          By providing us with your email address, you are giving us permission to send you a notice when the official MarketingZone website goes live later this spring.You will not get advertising blasts directly from any third party.</p>
        <p><strong>Contact Us</strong><br>
          Queries via our Contact Us addresses are held in confidence. We will reply directly to your question or query, and will store your information in our own customer service database in order to keep track of it for the future. </p>
        <p><strong>Site Activity Tracking &amp; Cookies</strong><br>
          We use analytics technology such as Google Analytics to measure and optimize our site’s performance. We may also serve cookies from our email service provider. The purpose of these cookies is to avoid serving you with an overlay more than once per session, because otherwise it would be annoying. Other cookies may be used in future for tracking activity on the site in the aggregate.</p>
        <p><strong>Misc</strong><br>
          This Privacy Policy is subject to change without notice; however, it is our company policy to try to maintain your privacy at all times. By surfing this site and/or submitting any forms or email requests, you are agreeing to our policies. <br>
          If you have any questions please <a href="mailto:info@marketingzone.com">contact us</a>.</p>
        <p>We promise to be responsive!      </p>
