<p><span class="garamondYellow16">Fair Information Values</span><br>
    <strong>Fairness:</strong> We consider consumer expectations about their
    privacy in all our businesses. We only offer products and services that assure
    a favorable
      balance between
      consumer benefits and consumer privacy. </p>
<p><strong>Public Record: </strong>We believe that an
        open public record creates significant value for society, enhances consumer
        choice and creates consumer opportunity. We
      actively support an open public record and emphasize its importance and
  contribution to our economy. </p>
<p><strong>Use: </strong>We believe we should behave responsibly when
      we use information about a consumer in our business. We will obey the laws
      governing the collection,
          use
          and dissemination of data.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> We will take reasonable steps to
    help assure the accuracy of the data we collect, use and disseminate. Where
    possible, we will take
            reasonable
            steps
            to correct inaccurate information. When, as with the public record,
    we cannot correct inaccurate information, we will take all reasonable steps
            to assist
            consumers in identifying the source of the erroneous data so that
  the consumer can secure the required corrections. </p>
<p><strong>Education: </strong>We endeavor to
          educate the users of our products and services, our employees and others
          in our industry about the importance of consumer
          privacy.
          We will instruct our employees on our fair information values and on
          the responsible collection and use of data. We will encourage others
          in our
          industry to collect
          and use information in a responsible manner. </p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> We will maintain
    appropriate facilities and systems to protect against unauthorized access
  to and corruption of the data we maintain. </p>
