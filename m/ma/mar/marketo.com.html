    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 16, 2016</p>
    <p>Marketo, Inc. and its Affiliates ("<strong>Marketo</strong>" or "<strong>We</strong>") know that you care about
        how the information we receive from you is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy
        Policy describes Marketo’s privacy practices in relation to information that we collect through websites
        operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “<strong>Domains</strong>”),
        through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices that
        link to this Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Apps</strong>”), through our social media pages and apps located at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Marketo" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/Marketo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/marketo" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/marketo</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+marketo" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/+marketo</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com</a> (collectively, the

        through HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively,
        including the Domains, the Apps and the Social Media Pages, the “<strong>Sites</strong>”). “<strong>You</strong>”
        or a “<strong>user</strong>” refers to any individual who visits or otherwise uses the Sites. By using the
        Sites, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Marketo does not own or control, or to
        individuals that Marketo does not employ or manage. </p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy also does not apply to information that we receive or handle on behalf of our subscribers in
        our role as a service provider, such as information that we receive through the Marketo Marketing Automation
        Software Services or other Marketo services, including any apps we make available for use by Services
        subscribers (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). Such information is governed by the terms of the
        applicable services agreement, rather than this Privacy Policy. </p>

        <li><h3>What Types of Information Does Marketo Collect About its Users?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Personal Information. “Personal Information”</strong> is information that identifies you
                    as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, including: name, title, company name, job
                    function, expertise, postal address, telephone number, or email address. If you submit any Personal
                    Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Sites,
                    you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in
                    accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Other Information. “Other Information” </strong> is any information that does not reveal
                    your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This might
                    include, for instance, browser and device information; App usage data; information collected through
                    cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies; demographic information and other information provided
                    by you; or aggregated information. We use this information to facilitate our operation of the Sites
                    and for other purposes described below.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>IP Address: </strong> Your “<strong>IP Address” </strong> is a number that is
                    automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
                    An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you access
                    the Sites, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting IP
                    Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other
                    services. Marketo uses IP Addresses to calculate usage levels of the Sites, help diagnose problems
                    with its servers, administer the Sites, and monitoring the regions from which you navigate to
                    Marketo’s Sites.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h3>How Does Marketo Collect Information? </h3>
            <p><strong>Personal Information. </strong> We and our service providers may collect Personal Information in
                a variety of ways, including: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Through the Sites: </strong> We may collect Personal Information through the Sites, e.g.,
                    when you request a free trial or demo, register for a webinar, contact us, subscribe to our email
                    newsletter, download content (e.g. whitepapers), or register to use our Sites.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Offline: </strong> We may collect Personal Information from you offline, such as when you
                    attend one of our events, during phone calls with sales representatives, or when you contact
                    customer service.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Through You: </strong> Marketo may collect information such as your location or your
                    preferred means of communication when you voluntarily provide it. Unless combined with Personal
                    Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Sites. Note
                    that there is no legal obligation for you to provide us with Personal Information and any
                    information collected by us will be provided by you at your own will and with your consent.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Information From Other Sources: </strong> In order to enhance our ability to provide
                    relevant marketing, offers, and services to you, we may obtain information about you from other
                    sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms, as well as from
                    other third parties.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other Information. </strong> We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a
                variety of ways, including: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Through Your Browser or Device: </strong> Certain information is collected by most
                    browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address,
                    computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device
                    manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the
                    Sites (such as the Apps) you are using.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Through Your Use of the Apps: </strong> When you download and use an App, we and our
                    service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your
                    device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on
                    your device number.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Through Cookies and Other Similar Technologies: </strong> Cookies and other similar
                    technologies may be used to collect Other Information. We may use third parties to serve
                    advertisements on other websites that may be of interest to you, based on information collected
                    about your use of our Sites and other websites.&nbsp; To do so, these companies may place or recognize a
                    unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags and web beacons).&nbsp; Please
                    review our <a href="https://legal.marketo.com/cookies/">Cookies Policy</a> for more information.
                    Marketo does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may
                    include ‘do not track’ instructions.</p>
                    <p>Marketo also uses web analytics services, which currently include Google Analytics and Crazy Egg
                        Analysis Service. </p>
                    <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("<strong>Google</strong>").
                        Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to analyze how users use the Domains. The
                        information generated about Domain usage (including your shortened IP address) is transmitted to
                        Google in the U.S. This information is used to evaluate visitors’ use of the Domain, compile
                        statistical reports on Domain activity, and provide other services related to the Site and
                        Internet use. Google may also collect information about Domain visitors’ use of other websites.
                        For more information about Google Analytics, or to opt out of Google Analytics, please go to: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Crazy Egg’s Analysis Service is a web analytics service that gives us data about where users are
                        clicking on our site. You can visit their privacy policy at: <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.crazyegg.com/privacy</a> and their opt-out feature at: <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/opt-out" target="_blank">https://www.crazyegg.com/opt-out.</a>
                    </p></li>
                <li><p><strong>By Aggregating Information: </strong> Aggregated Personal Information does not personally
                    identify you or any other user of the Sites (for example, we may aggregate Personal Information to
                    calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h3>How Does Marketo Use Personal Information? </h3>
            <p>We may use Personal Information: </p>

                services. In certain situations, these businesses operate within the Sites. We may disclose Personal
                Information to our partners for the purposes described above. Some of our third-party business partners
                may co-sponsor events and other offerings with Marketo. We may share Personal Information with these

            <h3>Agents and Service Providers: </h3>

                to maintain the privacy, confidentiality and security of the Personal Information. </p>
            <h3>Sweepstakes: </h3>

            <p>Personal Information may also be disclosed by you through the Sites, on message boards, chat, profile
                pages and blogs and other services to which you are able to post information and materials (including,
                without limitation, our Marketo Blog, at <a href="http://blog.marketo.com" target="_blank">http://blog.marketo.com</a>
                and the Social Media Pages). This information may appear in public ways, such as through search engines
                or other publicly available platforms, and may be “crawled” or searched by third parties. Please do not
                post any information that you do not want to reveal to the public at large. </p>
            <h3>Business Transfers: </h3>
            <p>In some cases, we may buy or sell assets or businesses. In these types of transactions, user information
                is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Marketo may disclose Personal Information
                to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer,
                or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection
                with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). </p>
            <h3>Protection of Marketo and Others: </h3>
            <p>We may release Personal Information when we believe that release is necessary or appropriate (a) under
                applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c)
                to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government
                authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce or apply our conditions of use and other
                agreements; (e)&nbsp;to protect our operations or those of any of our Affiliates; (f) to allow us to pursue

                property, or safety of Marketo, our employees, our Affiliates, our users, or any other person or entity.
                This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
                credit risk reduction. </p></li>
        <li><h3>How Does Marketo Use and Disclose Other Information? </h3>
            <p>We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise
                under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under
                applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal
                Information.
            </p><p>In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your
                name with your geographical location). If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal
                Information for as long as it is combined. </p></li>
        <li><h3>How Does Marketo Secure Personal Information About Me? </h3>
            <p>We have implemented organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect Personal
                Information within our organization, including security controls to prevent unauthorized access to our
                systems. While we take reasonable steps to secure your Personal Information from loss, misuse,
                interference and unauthorized access, modification and disclosure, you should be aware no security
                procedures or protocols are ever guaranteed to be 100 percent secure from intrusion or hacking, and
                there is therefore always some risk assumed by sharing Personal Information online. If you have reason
                to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security
                of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the “<em>Questions,
                    Concerns and Complaints</em>” section below. </p></li>
        <li><h3>How Can I Access, Correct, Amend or Remove Information About Me? </h3>
            <p>If you would like to access, correct, amend, remove or limit the use or disclosure of any Personal
                Information about you that has been collected and stored by Marketo, please notify us at <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@marketo.com" target="_blank">privacyofficer@marketo.com</a> so that
                we may consider and respond to your request in accordance with applicable law. </p>
            <p>For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated
                with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your
                identity before implementing your request. We will respond to your request within 45 days. </p>
            <p>Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete
                any transactions that you began prior to requesting such access, change or deletion. </p></li>
        <li><h3>For How Long Will Marketo Retain My Personal Information? </h3>
            <p>We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
                this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. </p></li>
        <li><h3>What Choices Do I Have? </h3>
            <p>You can always opt not to disclose information. However, if you elect to do so, we may be limited in
                responding to your inquiry or providing services to you. </p>
            <p>You may opt-out of receiving marketing messages from Marketo or our Affiliates by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@marketo.com" target="_blank">privacyofficer@marketo.com</a>, by
                unsubscribing through the unsubscribe or opt-out link in an email, or by unsubscribing via the Marketo
                Subscription Center at <a href="http://pages2.marketo.com/emailsubscription" target="_blank">http://pages2.marketo.com/emailsubscription.</a>
                We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you
                opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you important administrative
                messages. </p></li>

        <li><h3>Can Children Use Marketo's Sites? </h3>
            <p>The Sites are not intended for minors under the age of 18. Marketo does not knowingly or specifically
