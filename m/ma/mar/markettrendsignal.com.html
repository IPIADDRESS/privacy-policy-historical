<p>Disclaimer: There is no guarantee past performance will be indicative or future results. No assurance can be given that any implied recommendation will be profitable or will not be subject to losses. All Clients should understand that the results of a particular period will not necessarily be indicative of results in future periods. The results and examples used in our advertisements, books, videos, websites or any other media are based on hypothetical trades. Plainly speaking, these trades were not actually executed. Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated trades do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, results may have overcompensated or undercompensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors such as lack of liquidity. Clients may have done better or worse than the results portrayed. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. No independent party has audited the hypothetical performance contained at this Web site, nor has any independent party undertaken to confirm that they reflect the trading method under the assumptions or conditions specified hereafter. While the results presented at this Web site are based upon certain assumptions believed to reflect actual trading conditions, these assumptions may not include all variables that will affect, or have in the past affected the execution of trades indicated by Market Trend Signal. Results do not account for commissions or slippage. Because Clients may be involved in trades at different times and may use various exit approaches, they may or may not have received the best available price on the purchase or the sale of a position. The simulation assumes purchase and sale prices believed to be attainable. In actual trading, prices received may or may not be the same as the assumed order prices. <a href="https://www.markettrendsignal.com/90percent.php" target="_blank" style="color:#999; text-decoration:none;">The 90% accuracy discussed in the letter represents 9 out of 10 MuscleStocks having a positive 5 year back tested annual trade expectancy.</a></p>
