					<p>Market Trend Signal will not sell PII collected on this site to third-party marketers.</p>

Market Trend Signal reserves the right to transfer and disclose PII in this circumstance, but data collected by Market Trend Signal will be governed by the same privacy policy that existed prior to any change in business conditions unless you consent to the new privacy policy.</p>
					<p>Consumer information managed by Market Trend Signal pursuant to a list-management arrangement.</p>
					<p>Market Trend Signal is in the business of managing email-recipient lists for clients. As such, Market Trend Signal receives PII from marketing partners and uses that PII to send relevant marketing content to those recipients. Market Trend Signal's use of PII collected by third-party marketing partners is limited to the uses allowed under the third-party's privacy policy previously agreed to by the consumer. Market Trend Signal will utilize service providers who assist us with our marketing efforts, but those service providers will not use any PII collected by third-party marketing partners and managed by Market Trend Signal for their own marketing purposes and are prohibited by contract from sharing that PII with any party other than Market Trend Signal. These businesses may include, but are not limited to: providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation services.</p>

					<p>Choice</p>
					<p>Market Trend Signal manages e-mail lists through its list management arrangements. Consumers may wish to remove themselves from specific Market Trend Signal marketing lists. As such, users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the list-unsubscribe option that is present and available at the end of each e-mail that Market Trend Signal sends.</p>
					<p>Moreover, consumers may elect not to receive advertisements from a specific advertiser at any time. In every e-mail communication we send, there is also an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from receiving commercial emails from that specific advertiser by clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions provided. We process all unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion.</p>
					<p>Unsubscribe requests are either processed on an advertiser-specific basis or on a list-specific basis, depending on the selection the consumer makes. Unsubscribing from one list managed by Market Trend Signal will not remove the consumer from all Market Trend Signal marketing lists. Similarly, unsubscribing from one advertiser will not prevent the consumer from receiving all advertisers' emails.</p>

					<p>You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the advertising opt-out page.</p>
					<p>You may also opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.</p>

Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we reserve the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule.</p>

					<p>We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire number to the appropriate credit card company for processing of your orders.</p>
					<p>It is important to you to protect against unauthorized access to your password, in our member area. Make sure you take the steps necessary to keep that secure.</p>

                	<p>Disclaimer: There is no guarantee past performance will be indicative or future results. No assurance can be given that any implied recommendation will be profitable or will not be subject to losses. All Clients should understand that the results of a particular period will not necessarily be indicative of results in future periods. The results and examples used in our advertisements, books, videos, websites or any other media are based on hypothetical trades. Plainly speaking, these trades were not actually executed. Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated trades do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, results may have overcompensated or undercompensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors such as lack of liquidity. Clients may have done better or worse than the results portrayed. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. No independent party has audited the hypothetical performance contained at this Web site, nor has any independent party undertaken to confirm that they reflect the trading method under the assumptions or conditions specified hereafter. While the results presented at this Web site are based upon certain assumptions believed to reflect actual trading conditions, these assumptions may not include all variables that will affect, or have in the past affected the execution of trades indicated by Market Trend Signal. Results do not account for commissions or slippage. Because Clients may be involved in trades at different times and may use various exit approaches, they may or may not have received the best available price on the purchase or the sale of a position. The simulation assumes purchase and sale prices believed to be attainable. In actual trading, prices received may or may not be the same as the assumed order prices. The 90% accuracy discussed in the letter represents 9 out of 10 MuscleStocks having a positive 5 year back tested annual trade expectancy.</p>
