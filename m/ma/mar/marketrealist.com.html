<p>In the event that we decide to operate a user forum via the Site, and you decide to participate in that forum, any personal private and/or confidential information that you elect to disclose to other users on the forum shall be disclosed voluntarily and at your own risk.&nbsp; Such disclosures shall not be considered User Information, and we are not responsible for maintaining the security of any information so disclosed.</p>

<p>The Company’s web server records visitor IP addresses and domain names for reporting and site usage analysis. This information is reported internally and then purged periodically.</p>
<p>We use cookies to enable you to sign in and to help personalize your experience of the Site. A cookie is a small text file that a web page server places on your hard disk.&nbsp; A web server assigns cookies uniquely to you and only a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you can read the cookies.&nbsp; One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.&nbsp; For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a website, a cookie helps the website to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Using cookies simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation. When you return to the website, you can retrieve the information you previously provided, so you can easily use the website’s features that you customized.&nbsp; You have the ability to accept or decline our cookies.

<h4>Information Obtained from Children Under 13 Years of Age</h4>
<p>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Privacy Policy, the following terms shall apply to User Information obtained from users under the age of 13 years (“Junior Users”).&nbsp; For the purposes of this section, the term “Personal Information” means individually identifiable information about an individual collected online, including:</p>
