We have trusted relationships with carefully selected third parties who carry out services on our behalf. All these third parties have a contract with us and have agreed to keep your personal information confidential and secure and only to use it for the purposes that we allow.</p><p>We may share information about you to the following people and organisations to:</p><h3>Operate your account and provide services</h3><ul><li>any person working for a company within the NewDay Group;</li><li>any firm, organisation or person that we use to help us to operate our business, to provide services, to collect payments and to recover debts;</li><li>any firm, organisation or person together with whom we provide products and services;</li><li>any payment system we may use;</li><li>any firm that provides analytical, market research or similar services to us;</li><li>the insurers with whom you have any policy related to your credit card (if applicable).</li></ul><h3>Manage your account</h3><ul><li>any person who has told us that they are, and who we reasonably believe to be, your close relative, carer or helper where you are unable to handle your own affairs because of mental capacity, ill health or other similar issues;</li><li>any additional cardholder on your account.</li></ul><h3>Prevent Crime and Terrorism and for Regulatory Purposes</h3><ul><li>certain authorities in order to detect and prevent terrorism (including to authorities outside the UK);</li><li>regulators, including the FCA, the Competition and Markets Authority, ombudsmen and other authorities including tax authorities (including those overseas), where we are requested by them to do so;</li><li>certain organisations who may require us to disclose the data to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations.</li></ul><h3>Update credit reference agencies</h3><ul><li>Credit Reference Agencies and Fraud Prevention Agencies please refer to our FAQs at the bottom of this page for more information.</li></ul><h3>Support any business transfers</h3><p>We may in the future wish to sell, transfer or merge part or all of our business or assets, or any associated rights or interests or to acquire another business. If we do so, we may disclose your personal information to a potential buyer, transferee, merger partner or seller and their advisers with whom we are in talks so long as they agree to keep your information confidential and to use it only in relation to the possible transactions. If the transaction goes ahead, the purchaser, transferee or merger partner may use your personal information in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</p><p>We may sell your debt to a third party, but if we do, we will require them to keep your personal information secure.</p><h2>How we use your information</h2><p>We will use your information to:</p><ul><li>search Credit Reference Agencies and Fraud Prevention Agencies;</li><li>make, or assist in making, credit decisions about you, assess lending risks and to check the details that you have let us and others have;</li><li>operate and manage your account and manage any application, agreement or correspondence you may have with us and to conduct financial reviews;</li><li>perform other administrative and operational functions including the testing of systems;</li><li>monitor and analyse our business, including to carry out customer modelling and statistical, trend and transactional analysis;</li><li>form a view of you as an individual and to identify, develop or improve products that may be of interest to you and to carry out market research;</li><li>provide you with products and services and tell you about changes to these products and services;</li><li>contact you by email, sms, post or phone or in any other way about our products and services unless you tell us that you prefer not to receive marketing;</li><li>carry out audits;</li><li>trace your whereabouts where we do not have up to date contact details for you;</li><li>recover any debt you owe us;</li><li>provide information to independent external bodies such as government departments and agencies, universities and similar to carry out research;</li><li>comply with our regulatory obligations and to identify, prevent, detect or tackle fraud, money laundering, terrorism and other crimes.</li></ul><p>Your data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your permission or where we are permitted to do so by law or it is in the public interest to disclose the information or is otherwise permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p><h2>Security</h2><p>We know how important it is to keep your personal information secure. We protect that information using strong encryption when data is both being transferred and when at rest. Access to data is strictly controlled. We use firewalls and other security measures to protect our servers and networks from external attack. Our security systems meet or exceed industry standards.</p><h2>Cookies</h2><p><a href="/cookies-policy/">Cookies Policy</a></p><h2>Using companies to process your information outside the UK</h2><p>We may transfer your personal information so that we can run your account and provide other services from:</p><ul><li>countries within the EEA (where the same data protection standards apply as in the UK);</li><li>countries outside the EEA; if we do so, we will require that your personal information is handled and protected to at least EEA standards.</li></ul><p>We may process payments through other financial institutions such as banks and the worldwide payments system operated by the SWIFT organisation. These external organisations may process and store your personal information abroad and may have to disclose it to overseas authorities to help them to fight against crime and terrorism. If these authorities are outside the EEA, your personal information may not be protected to the same standards as in the EEA.</p><h2>Using Credit Scoring</h2><p>When you ask us to check your eligibility or you apply to us for credit, we may use an automated system known as credit scoring to help us decide whether to lend to you. It is a way of assessing how much you are able to afford to borrow and how you are likely to manage your account. Most lenders use credit scoring to help make fair and informed decisions about lending.</p><p>Credit scoring takes account of information from three sources – (i) the information you give us on your application, (ii) information provided by credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies, including information about how you manage similar accounts; and (iii) information that may already be held about you by the NewDay Group. Credit scoring methods are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased.</p><p>Using credit scoring helps us to lend responsibly.</p><h2>How we check your identity</h2><p>As well as searching credit reference agencies, we may ask you to provide physical forms of identity when you apply for a credit card.</p><h2>Declined Applications</h2><p>If you apply to us but we are unable to offer you a credit card you can contact us within 21 days to ask to have the decision reconsidered.</p><p>We will keep your data for statistical analysis, fraud prevention and credit scoring purposes. We may also contact you by post, email, sms or phone about our products and services if you have given us permission to do so.</p><h2>Incomplete Applications</h2><p>If you begin an application with us but this application is not completed, we may retain your personal data for no more than six months (180 days) so that we can contact you about your application and to help you to complete it, if this is what you want to do. An incomplete application is defined as personal data that has been provided by you to NewDay Group, but without permission for NewDay Group to perform a Credit Reference Agency search and to make a credit decision about you.</p><h2>Access to your information</h2><p>Under the Data Protection Act 1998 you have a right to access certain personal records that we hold about you. This is called a data subject access request and you can make a request by writing to marbles Customer Services, PO BOX 136, Sheffield, S98 1HB. A fee is payable.</p><p>We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct or remove any data that you think is no longer up to date.</p><p>You have a right under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to request credit reference agencies to provide you with information that they hold about you. A fee is payable.</p><h2>Contact from NewDay Group</h2><p>As part of the application process we ask whether we may contact you about our products and services. If you ticked yes, but no longer wish to receive such communications, please let us know by contacting marbles customer services on 0333 220 2692.</p><p>We want to make sure that we provide excellent customer service and we use various means of communication to do this including phone, post, email and sms.</p><p>We may contact you about services related to your credit card that we, or other companies outside the NewDay Group, may be able to provide you and which we think may be of interest to you or may benefit you financially. We promise not to contact you about everything – only if we think that it could be appropriate and relevant to you.</p><p>We will not send you marketing communications if you ask us not to and we will not provide information about you to companies outside the NewDay Group to use for their own marketing or commercial purposes without your permission.</p><p>If you do not want to receive marketing from us, please contact us on 0333 220 2692.</p><h2>Recording phone calls</h2><p>We may monitor or record phone calls with you in case we need to check that we have carried out your instructions correctly, to resolve queries or issues, for regulatory purposes, to help improve the quality of our service, to help detect or prevent fraud or other crimes. Conversations may also be monitored for staff training purposes.</p><h2>Social Networking Sites</h2><p>As part of our commitment to understand our customers better, we may research comments and opinions made public on social networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook.</p><h2>Important – Data Protection<br>A Guide to the use of your personal data by Credit Reference and Fraud Prevention Agencies NewDay Ltd and the NewDay Group</h2><h3>Please read this section very carefully</h3><h3>What we do</h3><h3>1) When you apply to us to open an account, we will:</h3><p>a) Check our own records for information on: -</p><p>i) Any account you and, if you have one, your financial associate may have or have had with us.</p><p>A financial associate is someone with whom you have a personal relationship that creates a joint financial unit in a similar way to a married couple. You will have been living at the same address at the time. It is not intended to include temporary arrangements such as students or rented flat sharers or business relationships.</p><p>Credit reference agencies may link together the records of people that are part of a financial unit. They may do this when people are known to be linked, such as being married or have jointly applied for credit or have joint accounts. They may also link people together if they, themselves, state that they are financially linked.</p><p>b) Search at credit reference agencies for information on: -</p><p>i) Your personal accounts;</p><p>ii) if have ever previously made joint applications or have joint accounts that are financially linked, we will check your financial associates’ personal accounts as well;</p><p>iii) Very occasionally if there is insufficient information to enable us to assist you, we may also use information about other members of your family; and</p><p>iv) If you are a director or partner in a small business we may also check on your business accounts.</p><p>c) Search at fraud prevention agencies for information on you and any addresses at which you have lived and on your business (if you have one).</p><h3>2) What we do with the information you supply to us as part of the application:</h3><p>a) Information that is supplied to us will be sent to the credit reference agencies.</p><p>b) If you are making a joint application or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we will: -</p><p>i) Search, link and/or record information at credit reference agencies about you both;</p><p>ii) Link any individual identified as your financial associate, in our own records;</p><p>iii) Take both your and their information into account in future applications by either or both of you; and</p><p>iv) Continue this linking until the account closes and one of you notifies us that you are no longer linked.</p><h3>So you must be sure that you have their agreement to disclose information about them.</h3><p>c) If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect or identify fraud we will record this and may also pass this information to fraud prevention agencies and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention.</p><p>d) Your data may also be used by us to offer you other products, but only if you have given your permission. That will be on any application that you have completed.</p><h3>3) With the information that we obtain we will:</h3><p>a) Assess this application for credit.</p><p>b) Check details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities.</p><p>c) Verify your identity and the identity of your spouse, partner or other directors/partners (if any).</p><p>d) Undertake checks for the prevention and detection of crime, fraud and/or money laundering.</p><p>We may use scoring methods to assess this application and to verify your identity.</p><p>Any or all of these processes may be automated.</p><h3>4) What we do when you have an account:</h3><p>a) Where you borrow or may borrow from us, we will give details of your personal and/or business account (if you have one), including names and parties to the account and how you manage it/them to credit reference agencies.</p><p>b) If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we will tell credit reference agencies.</p><p>c) We may make periodic searches of our own group records and at credit reference agencies to manage your account with us, including whether to make credit available, increase the amount of credit available or to continue or extend existing credit. We may also check at fraud prevention agencies to prevent or detect fraud.</p><h2>What Credit Reference and Fraud Prevention Agencies do</h2><h3>5) When credit reference agencies receive a search from us they will:</h3><p>a) Place a search “footprint” on your credit file whether or not this application proceeds. If the search was for a credit application the record of that search (but not the name of the organisation that carried it out) may be seen by other organisations when you apply for credit in the future.</p><p>b) Link together the records of you and anyone that you have advised is your financial associate including previous and subsequent names of parties to the account. Links between financial associates will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the credit reference agencies.</p><p>Financial associates may “break the link” between them if their circumstances change such that they are no longer a financial unit. They should apply for their credit file from a credit reference agency and file for a “disassociation”.</p><h3>6) They will supply to us:</h3><p>a) Credit information such as previous applications and the conduct of the accounts in your name and of your associate(s) (if there is a link between you) and/or your business accounts (if you have one).</p><p>b) Public information such as County Court Judgments (CCJs) and bankruptcies.</p><p>c) Electoral Register information.</p><p>d) Fraud prevention information.</p><h3>7) When information is supplied by us, to them, on your account(s):</h3><p>a) Credit reference agencies will record the details that are supplied on your personal and/or business account (if you have one) including any previous and subsequent names that have been used by the accountholders and how you/they manage it/them.</p><p>b) If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, credit reference agencies will record the outstanding debt.</p><p>c) Records shared with credit reference agencies remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted.</p><h3>8) How your data will NOT be used by credit reference agencies:</h3><p>a) It will <strong>not</strong> be used to create a blacklist.</p><p>b) It will not be <strong>used</strong> by the credit reference agency to make a decision.</p><h3>9) How your data WILL be used by credit reference agencies:</h3><p>a) The information which we and other organisations provide to the credit reference agencies about you, your financial associates and your business (if you have one) may be supplied by credit reference agencies to other organisations and used by them to:</p><ol><li>i) Prevent crime, fraud and money laundering by, for example checking details provided on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities;</li><li>ii) Check the operation of credit and credit-related accounts;</li><li>iii) Verify your identity if you or your financial associate applies for other facilities;</li><li>iv) Make decisions on credit and credit related services about you, your partner, other members of your household or your business;</li><li>v) Manage your personal, your partner’s and/or business (if you have one) credit or credit related account or other facilities;</li><li>vi) Trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe; and</li><li>vii) Undertake statistical analysis and system testing.</li></ol><h3>10) How your data may be used by fraud prevention agencies:</h3><p>a) The information which we provide to the fraud prevention agencies about you, your financial associates and your business (if you have one) may be supplied by fraud prevention agencies to other organisations and used by them and us to prevent crime, fraud and money laundering by, for example:</p><ol><li>i) Checking details provided on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities;</li><li>ii) Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities;</li><li>iii) Cross Checking details provided on proposals and claims for all types of insurance;</li><li>iv) Checking details on applications for jobs or when checked as part of employment;</li><li>v) Verify your identity if you or your financial associate applies for other facilities including all types of insurance proposals and claims;</li><li>vi) Trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe;</li><li>vii) Conduct other checks to prevent or detect fraud;</li><li>viii) We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies; and/or</li><li>ix) Undertake statistical analysis and system testing.</li></ol><h3>11) Your data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998.</h3><h3>12) Your data may also be used to offer you other products, but only where permitted by you.</h3><h2>How to find out more</h2><p>You can contact the Credit Reference Agencies currently operating in the UK; the information they hold may not be the same so it is worth contacting them all. They will charge you a small statutory fee.</p><ul><li>CallCredit, Consumer Services Team, PO Box 491, Leeds, LS3 1WZ or call 0870 0601414.</li><li>Equifax PLC, Credit File Advice Centre, PO Box 3001, Bradford, BD1 5US or call 0844 335 0550 or log on to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myequifax.co.uk">http://www.myequifax.co.uk</a></li><li>Experian, Consumer Help Service, PO Box 8000, Nottingham NG80 7WF or call 0844 4818000 or log on to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.experian.co.uk.">http://www.experian.co.uk.</a></li></ul><p>Please contact marbles customer services on 0333 220 2692 if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies.</p><h2>Questions and Answers</h2><h3>Q: What is a credit reference agency?</h3><p>A: Credit reference agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information on consumers’ and businesses’ credit behaviour, on behalf of organisations in the UK.</p><h3>Q: What is a fraud prevention agency?</h3><p>A: Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs) collect, maintain and share information on known and suspected fraudulent activity. Some CRAs also act as FPAs.</p><h3>Q: Why do you use them when I have applied to your organisation?</h3><p>A: Although you have applied to us (NewDay Ltd) and we will check our own records, we will also contact CRAs to get information on your credit behaviour with other organisations. This will help us make the best possible assessment of your overall situation before we make a decision.</p><h3>Q: Where do they get the information?</h3><p>A: Publicly available information:</p><ul><li>The Electoral Register from Local Authorities;</li><li>County Court Judgments from Registry Trust;</li><li>Bankruptcy (and other similar orders) from the Insolvency Service.</li></ul><p>Fraud information may also come from fraud prevention agencies.</p><p>Credit information comes from information on applications to banks, building societies, credit card companies etc. and also from the conduct of those accounts.</p><h3>Q: How will I know if my information is to be sent to a Credit Reference Agency or a Fraud Prevention Agency?</h3><p>A: You will be told when you apply for an account if your application data is to be supplied. The next section of this privacy policy will tell you how, when and why we will search at CRAs and FPAs and what we will do with the information we obtain from them. We will also tell you if we plan to send payment history information on you or your business, if you have one, to CRAs. You can ask at any time the name of CRAs and FPAs.</p><h3>Q: Why is my data used in this way?</h3><p>A: We and other organisations want to make the best possible decisions we can, in order to make sure that you, or your business, will be able to repay us. Some organisations may also use the information to check your identity. In this way we can ensure that we all make responsible decisions. At the same time we also want to make decisions quickly and easily and, by using up to date information, provided electronically, we are able to make the most reliable and fair decisions possible.</p><h3>Q: Who controls what such agencies are allowed to do with my data?</h3><p>A: All organisations that collect and process personal data are regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998, overseen by the Information Commissioner’s Office. All credit reference agencies are in regular dialogue with the Commissioner. Use of the Electoral Register is controlled under the Representation of the People Act 2000.</p></div><nav class="content__nav"><h3>See Also:</h3><a href="/about-us/">About marbles</a> <a href="/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> <a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> <a href="/security/">Security</a> <a href="/cookies-policy/">Cookies</a> <a href="/contact-us/">Contact Us</a> <a href="/complaints/">Complaints</a></nav></div></section><footer class="footer footer--simple"><div class="wrap"><div class="logo"><a href="#"><object type="image/svg+xml" data="/img/marbles_logo.svg">SVG LOGO</object></a></div><nav><a href="/about-us/">About marbles</a> <a href="/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> <a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> <a href="/security/">Security</a> <a href="/cookies-policy/">Cookies</a> <a href="/contact-us/">Contact Us</a> <a href="/complaints/">Complaints</a></nav><div class="legal"><p>Credit is provided by NewDay Ltd.
