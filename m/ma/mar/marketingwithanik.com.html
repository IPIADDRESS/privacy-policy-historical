                <h3 class="spacer top">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
                <p>As is true of most Sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.</p>
                <p>Lurn uses cookies or similar technologies to store session information, analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users' movements around the Sites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.</p>
                <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to track your login status. This cookie is only ever transmitted over HTTPS. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We use persistent cookies to determine from where you were referred to our Sites so that we may provide commissions or referral fees, and recognize the last user ID that you used to log in. We may set and access Lurn cookies on your computer; cookies are required to use the Sites.</p>
                <p>You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" directory.  Please go to <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.aboutcookies.org</a> for more information on cookies, including how to disable them. If you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our Sites or service.

                <h3 class="spacer top">Third Party Tracking</h3>
                <p>Third parties also use cookies and other tracking technologies on our site, of which data is only collected in the aggregate. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Third parties use session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Sites, in order for you to use the shopping cart, and to otherwise use our services.</p>
                
                <h3 class="spacer top">Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting</h3>
                <p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites. This information is used to provide you targeted advertising across the internet, based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;(or if located in the European Union you may change your preferences by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">here</a>). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
                
                <h3 class="spacer top">Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                <p>Our practices with respect to the disclosure of personally identifiable information include the following:</p>
                <p><u>Consent</u>.&nbsp;We may disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties with your express consent.</p>
                <p><u>Vendors and Affiliated Businesses</u>.&nbsp;We share your personally identifiable information with our parent company, affiliated businesses, and with the vendor(s) whose products you purchase, for their use in a manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><u>Agents/Service Providers</u>.&nbsp;We use third party service providers to assist us in providing our Services and Sites, including database backup providers to protect our data, and  fraud prevention services. We may disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf or for your benefit. We may utilize the services of third parties to verify customer data, or to supplement other information we have collected. We may also contract with third parties to host our Sites and to conduct market research. All service providers are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide their respective services to us, and are obligated to protect your personally identifiable information under contract terms which are no less protective than those set forth in this Policy.</p>
                <p><u>Legal Process</u>.&nbsp;We may disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
                <p><u>Certain Business Transfers</u>.&nbsp;Your personally identifiable information may be disclosed as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, or financing or sale of Lurn assets, and could be transferred to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. It may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership. We will use reasonable efforts to direct any such transferee to use your personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Sites of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any resulting choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.</p>
                
                <h3 class="spacer top">Security</h3>
                <p>The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as credit card number on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using SSL.</p>
                <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                <p>The information we collect about you is stored in limited access servers. We maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information. We retain personally identifiable information only as long as necessary to complete a purchase, thwart fraud, or provide customer service.</p>
                
                <h3 class="spacer top">Links to Other Sites</h3>
                <p>If you click on a link to a third party site you will leave our site and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as us. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other site you visit or service provider from whom you request services.</p>
                
                <h3 class="spacer top">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, or by means of a notice on the Site. If we make any substantial change to the way we use your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by email.  You will have an opportunity to opt out of such new or different uses of your personally identifiable information prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
