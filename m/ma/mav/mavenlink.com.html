  <p style="font-size: 15px;">
    <strong>I. Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Mavenlink values your privacy. We limit the collection of personal information to those items necessary to fulfill
    the purposes identified below. If we use your information in a manner different than the purpose for which it is
    collected, then we will ask you for your consent prior to such use.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Account information.</strong> If you create an account to take advantage of the full range of services
    offered on the Mavenlink Sites, we ask for and record personal information such as your name and email address. We
    use your email address to send you updates and news, and contact you on behalf of other users (such as notification
    alerts from project or network activity).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Public Submissions</strong>. We store and may publicly display your public submissions on the site. When we
    display your submission, we do so together with your account name or chosen user name. The term "public submission"
    refers to the information that you submit or post to the Mavenlink Sites for public display, such as information
    that you display as part of your public profile, recommendations, and/or publicly facing network pages. For purposes
    of clarification, information within a project workspace is private and not public, and will not be subject to this
    paragraph.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Feedback</strong>. If you contact us to provide feedback, register a complaint, or ask a question, we will
    record any personal information and other content that you provide in your communication so that we can effectively
    respond to your communication.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Activity.</strong> We record information relating to your use of the Mavenlink Site, such as the searches
    you undertake, the pages you view, your browser type, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, time stamp
    information, transactions entered into, and parties transacted with on the Site. We use this type of information to
    administer the Mavenlink Site and provide the highest possible level of service to you. We also use this information
    in the aggregate to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest
    in and use of the various areas of the Mavenlink Site. You cannot be identified from this aggregate information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Cookies</strong>. We might send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely identify your browser and
    improve the quality of our service. The term "cookies" refers to small pieces of information that a website sends to
    your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the site. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you

    can be removed by following your browser help file directions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Enforcement.</strong> We may use the information we collect in connection with your use of the Mavenlink

    Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 15px;">
    <strong>II. Transfer of Information</strong>
  </p>

  <p>

    necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our Terms of Service and
    Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d)
    protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public. Please note that we

    prospective business relationship with those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For
    example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertising banners.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 15px;">
    <strong>III. Others' Information</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    You may choose to provide us with another person's e-mail address so that person may be invited to create an account
    on this website. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person about the invitation. By
    providing us with another person's e-mail address, you represent to us that you have obtained the consent of the
    person concerned as regards such disclosure to us of their personal information. All invitees are provided with the
    option not to receive further invitations. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply
    with legal process, as described above.

    you have any questions about the security on the Mavenlink Sites, please contact us. Although we take appropriate
    measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that your personal
    information will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
