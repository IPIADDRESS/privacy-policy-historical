Malwarebytes Privacy Policy<br>
Last Updated: March 15, 2013</h3>

 
<p>This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services, including, but not limited to, the online store made available via the Site (which has its own Privacy Policy, accessible at  <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/policy/ext/cb_privacy">http://www.malwarebytes.org/policy/ext/cb_privacy</a>). </p>

<b>How do we collect and use information?</b>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your account, if you have created an account in connection with your use of the Services), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>

<p><span class="underline">PII.</span> If you choose to create an account in connection with your use of our forums, blog, support services or subscription-based services, or if you choose to sign up to receive email newsletters or notifications from Malwarebytes or contact Malwarebytes via the Services, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, phone number and website URL (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”). If you sign up via the Services to act as a Malwarebytes reseller, we may also collect PII such as your company name, company address and company telephone and fax numbers.  </p>

<p><span class="underline">Non-PII.</span>  We may also collect certain information that is not PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, such as your gender, date of birth and city, state and country and any content that you make available via the Services in connection with your use of our forums, blog, support services or subscription-based services.  </p>

<p><span class="underline">Accounts.</span>  If you choose to create an account through one of your accounts with third party services (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) (“SNS Accounts”), you may have to provide us with your username (or userID) so that your identity can be authenticated by the SNS Account. When the authentication is complete, we’ll be able to link your account with the SNS Account and access certain PII, such as your name and email address, and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. We don’t receive or store passwords for any of your SNS Accounts.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Information Collected Using Cookies.</span> We collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties. </p>

<p><span class="underline">Information Related to Use of the Services.</span> Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both account holders and non-account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics to collect, monitor and analyze Log Data in order to increase our Services’ functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our visitors’ needs.  We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Services meet the criteria required to process their requests. Accordingly, Log Data is shared with Google, which has its own privacy policy <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a> addressing how it uses such information.  </p>

<p><span class="underline">Location Information.</span> In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. </p>

<b>What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</b>

<p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:</p>

<p><span class="underline">Forums.</span> If you choose to post questions, comments or other Content on our forums (http://forums.malwarebytes.org/ http://forums.malwarebytes.org/), the content of your post will be publicly viewable and searchable via the forum, in connection with your username and any other information you choose to make available via your forum account profile, including, but not limited to, your profile picture, the number of posts you have made on the forum, the number of times your profile has been viewed, your age and birthday, your gender, your location, the date you were last active on the forum and any contact information you choose to make available via your profile (e.g., AIM screen name and website URL).  Also, if you choose to send a message to another member of the forum, the content of your message will be sent to the applicable member in connection with your forum account profile information. We recommend that you guard your sensitive information when using our forums.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Blog.</span> If you choose to post questions, comments or other Content on our blog (accessible at  <a href="=&quot;http://blog.malwarebytes.org/&quot;">http://blog.malwarebytes.org/</a>), the content of your post will be publicly viewable via the blog in connection with your username. If you choose to connect your use of the blog with one of your SNS Accounts, the content of your post will be made available via the applicable SNS Accounts in accordance with the privacy settings in your SNS Account.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Support.</span>  If you post any support or Services-related content to the “Support” section of the Services (accessible at  <a href="http://helpdesk.malwarebytes.org/home">http://helpdesk.malwarebytes.org/home</a>), such content will be publicly viewable via the Services in connection with your name, email address, phone number, profile picture, a link to your SNS Account (if applicable), a summary of your use of the support section of the Services (e.g., topics, comments, subscriptions and votes) and any other information you choose to make available via your support account profile.  You may edit your support account profile information at any time via the “Support” section of the Services. Visitors to the Services can view your support account profile information at any time, so we recommend that you guard your sensitive information. </p>

<p><span class="underline">Information Shared with Our Services Providers.</span> We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Information Shared with Third Parties.</span> We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.</span> Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.</span> It is our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government, and to contest claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, it is also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (i) to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation or legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the rights, property and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (iii) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your Request.</span> We will share your PII with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.</p>

<b>The Security of Your Information</b>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>

<b>Links to Other Sites</b>
<p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.</p>

<b>Modifying Your Information</b>
<p>You can access and modify the PII associated with your use of the Services by contacting us at policies@malwarebytes.org. If you want us to delete your PII, your forum account or your support account, please contact us at policies@malwarebytes.org with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p>

<b>International Transfer</b>
<p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there. </p>  

<b>Our Policy Toward Children</b>
<p>Our Services are not directed to children under 18 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p>

<b>Changes to Privacy Policy</b>
<p>Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll indicate when such changes will become effective.</p>

<b>Questions?</b>
<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:policies@malwarebytes.org">policies@malwarebytes.org</a> if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy.</p>
