						In connection with other activities, such as utilizing online or hosted Products and Services, Malwarebytes 
						may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting a form. 
						It is optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities.

						operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit webpages, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. 
						Malwarebytes also uses such information to measure traffic patterns on the Site and usage of the Products and Services. 
						We do not match such information with any other information held by Malwarebytes unless we have your consent.</p>
