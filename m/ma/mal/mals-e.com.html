                        <p><b>WHAT DATA DO I KEEP ABOUT USERS?<br>
                          </b>Not much, is the answer! The only personal data 
                          I ask for from users is their name, country, telephone, 
                          fax and e-mail address. It's the stuff you see on the 
                          join form, <a href="https://www.mals-e.com/join.php"><b>see 
                          it here</b></a>. Of that only the Contact e-mail address 
                          is really absolutely essential, I don't mind if people 
                          don't want to provide the other stuff. All this data 
                          can be updated at any time in Admin (go to <i>Your details</i>). 
                        </p>
                        <p>If you have a Premium account then I will have your payment details 
                          stored in a <b>Billing account</b>. This will 
                          include your name, address, e-mail address and possibly 
                          your card details (if that is how you have elected to 
                          pay). European businesses will be required to provide 
                          a their tax number too (VAT number). All communications 
                          between you and your myMal account is over SSL, the 
                          financial data is stored encrypted. You may view and 
                          update any part of it by logging into your Billing account 
                          the details of which are e-mailed to you when you first 
                          create it. </p>
                        <p>From the moment you enter Admin your activities may 
                          be logged. Tracking is via cookie and IP address. This 
                          information may be used proactively to develop a profile 
                          of your behaviour. It is collected purely for the purpose 
                          of ensuring your own security. For example, if you try 
                          to login too many times with the wrong password then 
                          you may be blocked from further attempts. You cannot 
                          enter Admin without cookies enabled.</p>
                        <p>For information about cookies see the Help file that 
                          comes with your browser. As a general rule I only every 
                          use session (memory resident) cookies, they "die" 
                          when you close down your browser.</p>
                        <p><b><br>
                          USE OF THIS DATA<br>
                          </b>I don't have a mailing list, I don't make any sort 
                          of mass mailings to users. I use the Contact e-mail 
                          address only when I need to contact a user about an 
                          operational matter. If you have a Premium account holder 
                          you will receive a renewal notice when you paid up period 
                          is over. It is sent to the e-mail address in your Billing 
                          account. </p>
                        <p>Data such as a users country and business type is purely 
                          for statistical analysis. I keep it so that I can make 
                          sure I'm targeting my resources in the right places. 
                          I don't have any advertising on this site, I don't sell 
                          data to anyone else. It's just for me.</p>
                        <p>Note: SMTP (e-mail) is not an encrypted protocol. When 
                          we use an e-mail address it passes across the internet 
                          unencrypted...</p>

                        <p>There is a "Mall" with links to users websites,

                          publish information about their site as part of a post 
                          in the User Group Forum. But apart from these "self-disclosures" 
                          <b>there are no circumstances under which I would pass 
                          on any details about a user to a third-party</b>. Very 
                          occasionally I help a customer contact a merchant but 
                          I do so only after very carefully considering their

                        on our hard disks. There are no circumstances under which 
                        we would pass on customer data to anyone other than the
