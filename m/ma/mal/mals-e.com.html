                <p><span class="inlineHeaderText"><strong>WHAT DATA DO WE KEEP ABOUT USERS?</strong><br>
                </span><b><br>
                </b>Not much, is the answer! The only personal data 
                we ask for from users is their name, country, telephone, 
                fax and e-mail address. It's the stuff you see on the 
                join form, <a href="https://www.mals-e.com/join.php"><b>see 
                  it here</b></a>. Of that only the Contact e-mail address 
                is really absolutely essential, we don't mind if people 
                don't want to provide the other stuff. All this data 
        can be updated at any time in Admin (go to <i>Your details</i>). </p>
        <p>If you have a Premium account then we will have your payment details 
                stored in a <b>Billing account</b>. This will 
                include your name, address, e-mail address and possibly 
                your card details (if that is how you have elected to 
                pay). European businesses will be required to provide 
                a their tax number too (VAT number). All communications 
                between you and your myMal account is over SSL, the 
                financial data is stored encrypted. You may view and 
                update any part of it by logging into your Billing account 
                the details of which are e-mailed to you when you first 
        create it. </p>

              <p>From the moment you enter Admin your activities may 
                be logged. Tracking is via cookie and IP address. This 
                information may be used proactively to develop a profile 
                of your behaviour. It is collected purely for the purpose 
                of ensuring your own security. For example, if you try 
                to login too many times with the wrong password then 
                you may be blocked from further attempts. You cannot 
        enter Admin without cookies enabled.</p>
              <p>For information about cookies see the Help file that 
                comes with your browser. As a general rule we only ever 
                use session (memory resident) cookies, they "die" 
                when you close down your browser.<b><br>
                  <span class="inlineHeaderText"><br>
                    USE OF THIS DATA</span><br>
  <br>
                  </b>We don't have a mailing list and we don't make any sort 
                of mass mailings to users. We use the Contact e-mail 
                address only when we need to contact a user about an 
                operational matter. If you have a Premium account holder 
                you will receive a renewal notice when you paid up period 
                is over. It is sent to the e-mail address in your Billing 
        account. </p>

              <p>Data such as a users country and business type is purely 
                for statistical analysis. We keep it so that we can make 
                sure we're targeting our resources in the right places. 
                We don't have any advertising on this site, we don't sell 
        data to anyone else. It's just for us.</p>
              <p>Note: SMTP (e-mail) is not an encrypted protocol. When 
                we use an e-mail address it passes across the internet 
                unencrypted...<br>
                  <b><br>
                  <span class="inlineHeaderText">WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE DATA ABOUT YOU?</span><br>
                  <br>
                  </b>No one except employees of 
        Mal's e-commerce limited. Our host <a href="http://www.rackspace.com"><b>Rackspace.com</b></a> have physical access to the servers too of course. </p>

              <p>There is a "Mall" with links to users websites, 
                it is entirely voluntary to join. In addition some users 
                publish information about their site as part of a post 
                in the User Group Forum. But apart from these "self-disclosures" <b>there are no circumstances under which we would pass 
                  on any details about a user to a third-party</b>. Very 
                occasionally we help a customer contact a merchant but 
                we do so only after very carefully considering their 
        request.</p>

                    <br>
                </b>This Web site contains some links to other sites 
                that are not owned or controlled by Mal's e-commerce 
                Limited. Please be aware that we are not responsible for 
                the privacy practices of them. You should read the privacy 
                statements of each and every web site that collects 
                personally identifiable information.<br>

                  <br>
                This privacy statement applies only to information 
                collected by Mal's e-commerce Limited. <br>

                  <br>
                  </b>In the (unlikely) event Mal's e-commerce Limited 
                goes through a business transition, such as a merger, 
                acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a 
                portion of its assets, your personally identifiable 
                information will likely be among the assets transferred. 
                You will be notified by prominent notice on our Web 
                site, for 30 days, of any such change in ownership or 
                control of your personal information.<br>

                    Changes in this Privacy Statement<br>
  <br>

                post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, 
                and other places we deem appropriate so that you are 
                aware of what information we collect, how we use it, 
                and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <b><br>

                  <br>
                  </b>We do not keep customer data beyond the routine back-up 
                of the live database which is made for purely operational 
                reasons. Customer data belongs to the merchant, not to 
                Mal's e-commerce Limited, we just store it for you temporarily 
                on our hard disks. There are no circumstances under which 
                we would pass on customer data to anyone other than the 
        merchant to whom it belongs. </p>
