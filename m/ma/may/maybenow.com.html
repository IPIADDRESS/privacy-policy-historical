                        your browser on your computer's hard drive. Generally, cookies function by assigning
                        a unique number to your computer and one that actually has no meaning outside of
                        the site. The Cookie is meant to identify your particular computer. Our cookies
                        do not generally contain any personally identifiable information. Most Web browsers
                        automatically accept cookies, but usually you can configure your browser to prevent
                        this. Choosing to not accept cookies may make certain features of the Site unavailable
                        to you.

                        an Internet Service Provider. Each time you access the Site and each time you request
                        one of our pages, our server logs your IP address. Standing alone, your IP address
                        is not necessarily personally identifiable.

                        We will, however, disclose your personal information to our third party service

                        information other than to provide the services requested by us. For example, we
                        will release your credit card number to complete and/or confirm payments you make
                        on the Site. In addition, we may provide aggregated statistics about our users,

                        may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to disclose your personal
                        information. We will disclose such information upon receipt of a court order or
                        subpoena or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, or when otherwise
                        required by law to do so. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying
                        those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report
                        to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
                        Moreover, we may release account information and other personal information when
                        we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms
                        of Service Agreement or to protect the rights, property and safety of our users,
                        others and ourselves.

                        (3) Change in Control. We may disclose and ultimately transfer your personal information
                        in the context of a business transaction involving the reorganization, acquisition
                        or merger of our business or the sale of all or some of our assets provided that
                        the personal information disclosed is required to be used for the purposes permitted
                        by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring this information. In such event,
                        after a reorganization, acquisition, merger or sale has occurred, we will use reasonable
                        efforts to notify you (either by posting notice on the Site or by email to you at
                        the last known email address) that such a business transaction has occurred. B.
                        Retention of Personal Information. We will retain your personal information as long
