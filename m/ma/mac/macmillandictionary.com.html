<p>We use so-called social plugins ("plugins") of the social networking site facebook.com provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").

The list of Facebook Social Plugins and their appearance can be accessed via: <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins</a>.</p>

<p>If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the user's browser directly connects to Facebook's servers. The plugin and its content are made available directly on Facebook's servers and included in the website by the user's browser. Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is visiting the corresponding website. If the user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or she visits the website, Facebook may be able to connect the visit on the website to the user's Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugin – for example if he or she presses the like button or comments on something – the user's browser transmits this information to Facebook. Facebook stores this information. If a user is not a member of Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the user's IP-address.
