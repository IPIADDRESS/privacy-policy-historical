				At Future US, Inc., a magazine, disc media and website publisher, we are interested in protecting your 
				privacy. But sometimes we do need information to understand how to make our properties more interesting, 
				more specialized and more successful, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use 
				in those situations. Please read the complete privacy statement.
			    </p>

			    <h3><strong>Non US Visitors:</strong></h3>
			    <p>
                             	Our privacy policy is intended to meet the laws and requirements of the United States. If you are visiting 
				from outside the United States any information you provide will be treated in accordance with the laws of 
				the United States or, if the law in jurisdiction does not permit you to access our website, then you must 
				not maintain access to it.
			    </p>
			    
			    <h3><strong>Collecting your Personal Information:</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (that is, your first and last name; 
				your home or business address; your e-mail address; your telephone number; your gender) or allows us to 
				contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a 
				contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, or if you subscribe to one of our magazines or properties, or elect to 
				participate in a forum and/or a survey. Personal information collected by any of our websites often is 
				limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to 
				provide a service to you.
			    </p>
                            <p>
                                For example: If you choose to subscribe to a magazine or e-mail newsletter, we may request personal
				information such as: name, address, telephone number, and shipping information.
			    </p>

                            <h3><strong>Use of your Personal Information:</strong></h3>
			    <p>
                                We may use your personal information for the following primary purposes:
			       	</p><ul>
				    <li>
                                        To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.
				    </li>
				    <li>
                                        To alert you to special offers, updated information and other services.
				    </li>
				    <li>
                                        To help us determine if any modifications need to be made to our publications or with respect to 
					our subscriptions.
				    </li>
				    <li>
                                        To contact you regarding participation in a reader survey.
				    </li>
			       	</ul>
			    <p></p>
			    <p>
                                We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, 
				mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal 
				mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to 
				deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
			    </p>
			    <p>
				We also will occasionally share this information with third parties so that you may be informed of matters, 
				services or products of interest to readers of our magazines.
			    </p>
                            <p>
				We also will occasionally share this information with third parties so that you may be informed of matters, 
				services or products of interest to readers of our magazines.
                            </p>
                            <p>
				We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good 
				faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal 
				process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) act in urgent circumstances to 
				protect the personal safety of users of any of our websites, or the public; and (d) comply with negotiated
				agreements in the event of a merger or sale of any of our products.
                            </p>
			    
			    <h3><strong>Control of your Personal Information:</strong></h3>
                            <p>
				When you register on one of our websites, or otherwise give us personal information, we will not share that 
				information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. 
				It will only be used for the purposes stated above.
                            </p>
                            <p>
				We will occasionally allow other companies to offer our customers information about their products and 
				services. If you do not wish to receive any such mailings, you may send an e-mail to 
				<a href="mailto:webmaster@futureus.com">webmaster@futureus.com</a>.
                            </p>
			    
			    <h3><strong>Security of your Personal Information:</strong></h3>
                            <p>
				Future US, Inc., will use its best efforts to protect the security of your personal information and honor 
				your choices for its intended use.
                            </p>
                            <p>
				Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under 
				conditions explained above.
                            </p>

			    <h3><strong>Email Correspondence:</strong></h3>
			    <p>
				We may respond to email sent directly to us or through a online submission form. This information and 
				emails would only be shared with a third party in connection with a court order, sale of the website(s) 
				to a third party or to defend a legal claim. These emails would only rarely be used for one time 
				correspondence with that user. These e-mails are kept internally for our own day to day business purposes.
                            </p>

			    <h3><strong>Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy <br>(Users under the age of 13):</strong></h3>
			    <p>
				In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online 
				Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which 
				Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In 
				accordance with our policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:
                            </p>
                            <p>

	                                    Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable online or offline contact information from users

	                                <li>
	                                    Give children the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information;
	                                </li>
	                                <li>
	                                    Entice children with the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to divulge more information
					    than is needed to participate in the activity.
	                                </li>
