MacInstruct respects the privacy of the personal information you give us, such as 
your name, street address, telephone number and e-mail address, and other personal 
information you may provide. The following policy is intended to explain how we treat 
this information. This policy may change, so please check back from time to time. <br><br><br>

<b>Traffic data</b><br> 
Each time a visitor comes to a MacInstruct web site, our servers collect some basic technical 
information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (i.e., the ISP from which the user 
is logged on). We use software to keep track of traffic to our sites and derive such information 
as the location from which the traffic originates and which particular pages within MacInstruct 
are being viewed and for how long. After we analyze this information, we discard it. We may 
aggregate information about visitors and traffic and may share the results with advertisers; 
generally, we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data that 
you supply us without your permission. It will only be used to contact you in case you win 
a contest. <br><br><br>

<b>Information Security and Quality</b><br> 
We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information. We 
have implemented appropriate technical and managerial procedures to maintain information that 
is accurate, current, and complete. We will make a sincere effort to respond to your requests 
to correct personal information inaccuracies in a timely manner. <br><br><br>

<b>Newsletters and Other E-mail Features</b><br>
If you sign up to receive an e-mail newsletter from MacInstruct, such newsletters will 
be sent on a daily or weekly basis. You may also receive infrequent other announcements 
from MacInstruct. We will use your e-mail address for the distribution of these newsletters
and announcements. Users can choose to unsubscribe from MacInstruct newsletters at any 
time by following the unsubscribe instructions found in each e-mail. 
<br><br><br> 

<b>Use of Cookies</b><br> 
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored 
on your computer's hard drive. MacInstruct does not generally make use of cookies, although 
it is possible that they may be used in a limited way to assist in the delivery of 
advertisements, to identify how many unique visitors there are to the MacInstruct site 
and to track usage.<br><br> 

Other companies that place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign their
cookies to you in a process that MacInstruct does not control. <br><br>

In the event that MacInstruct starts to use Cookies more widely, they will never be used to 
track websites you visit other than MacInstruct. Some parties use cookies to view sites you 
visit other than their own, to assess your "viewing habits." MacInstruct will not subscribe 
to this practice. <br><br><br>

<b>Contests</b><br> 
MacInstruct may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events from time to time which require 
the collection, processing and storage of certain contact and demographic information 
(e.g., place of residence) for use as part of the contest. Sometimes these contests may 
be jointly-sponsored with companies. In that case the user's contact and other information 
will be shared with the other company only if it is expressly stated in the rules of the contest. 
<br><br>

However, such contests will include the option to receive e-mail from our partners regarding 
their products or services. If you sign up for such an e-mail list, we will release your 
e-mail address to our partner for the purpose of such mailings, and only for that purpose. 
We will not release any of your other personal information to that partner. If you do not 
sign up for such an e-mail list, our partners will receive no information on you - including 
your e-mail address - even if you enter the associated contest or promotion. <br><br><br>

<b>Surveys</b><br> 
MacInstruct may conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to collect certain 
demographic information about visitors to its site. This information may be compiled and 
shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details 
will be traceable or associated with specific readers. <br><br><br>

<b>Children's Privacy</b><br> 
Protecting the privacy of young children is important to us. For that reason, MacInstruct 
will not collect or maintain information at its web site from those actually known 
to be under 13, and no part of MacInstruct is intentionally structured to attract anyone under 
13. The sole exception to this is our mailing lists. If a child under 13 signs up for our 
newsletter or any of our mailing lists, they will remain a member unless we are asked 
to remove them by their parent or legal guardian. All such requests should be directed 
to <a href="mailto:matt@macinstruct.com">matt@macinstruct.com</a>.<br><br><br> 

<b>Other Disclosure of Personal Information</b><br> 
MacInstruct will not otherwise disclose or make use of personal information without 
consent of the user except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by 
law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy 
does not protect information you post to any on-line bulletin board, chat room, newsgroup 
or other public forum within the MacInstruct site. <br><br><br>

<b>Other Sites</b><br>
MacInstruct may contain links to sites on the Internet operated by others. MacInstruct cannot 
control and is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other web sites. 
<br><br><br>

<b>Unsubscribe and Data Removal Policies</b><br> 
If you would like to unsubscribe from a MacInstruct newsletter, please follow the instructions 
at the bottom of the newsletter itself or email your request to 
<a href="mailto:matt@macinstruct.com">matt@macinstruct.com</a>
<br><br><br>

<b>Who Can I Ask if I Have Any Additional Questions?</b><br> 
If you have any further questions or concerns about MacInstruct's privacy policies and use of 
personal information, please send them to <a href="mailto:matt@macinstruct.com">matt@macinstruct.com</a>.
