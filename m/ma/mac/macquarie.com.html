       Macquarie Group Privacy Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       Central to the success of Macquarie Group (being Macquarie Group Limited and its related bodies corporate globally) is our commitment to our clients. We honour without reservation our obligation to respect and protect the privacy of the personal information of individuals with whom we deal.
    </p>
    <h3>
       The information we collect
    </h3>
    <p>
       Whenever it is reasonable and practicable to do so, we only collect information about you directly from you.
    </p>
    <p>
       We only collect personal information about you which is reasonably necessary to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        provide you with quality products or services
      </li>
      <li>
        consider applications and approaches you make to us
      </li>
      <li>
        maintain your contact details
      </li>
      <li>
        fulfil our legal obligations under applicable laws and rules, such as those relating to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       We generally hold personal information relating to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the products and services we provide or have provided to you
      </li>
      <li>
        your financial interests and sometimes your financial position
      </li>
      <li>
        your contact details.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       We do not generally collect sensitive information about you unless required by applicable laws or rules. Sensitive information includes information relating to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        race
      </li>
      <li>
        political or religious beliefs
      </li>
      <li>
        sexual preferences
      </li>
      <li>
        criminal convictions
      </li>
      <li>
        membership of professional or trade associations or unions
      </li>
      <li>
        health information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       We collect health information where we offer products with an insurance component to our customers. We do not use or share that information for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration of a customer's policy, claim or account, or as otherwise disclosed to the customer when the information was collected.
    </p>
    <p>
       We also collect personal information from people who submit applications or register interest for employment with Macquarie Group. Please read the <a href="http://www.macquarie.com/mgl/com/global-careers/working/privacy">Careers Privacy Policy</a> for more information.
    </p>
    <h3>
       How that information is used
    </h3>
    <p>
       We only use and disclose personal information about you for the purpose for which it was disclosed to us or related purposes which would reasonably be expected without your permission.
    </p>
    <p>
       For example, we may from time to time use your personal information to inform you of investment opportunities or to provide information about products and services which we expect may be of interest to you. However, we do respect your right to ask us not to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
       We do not sell personal information to other organisations to allow them to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
       We may share personal information inside the Macquarie Group, and may disclose personal information outside the Macquarie Group:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        as required by applicable laws or rules, such as those relating to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing
      </li>
      <li>
        to service providers in, or outside of, Australia who provide services in connection with our products and services
      </li>
      <li>
        to your nominated financial adviser with your permission.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Laws and rules regarding the use of personal information may vary by jurisdiction. Macquarie Group complies with applicable laws and rules in the relevant jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Keeping information accurate and up to date
    </h3>
    <p>
       We take all reasonable steps to ensure that all information we hold is as accurate as is possible. You are able to contact us at any time and ask for its correction if you feel the information we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Keeping information secure
    </h3>
    <p>
       We use security procedures and the latest technology to protect the information we hold. Access to and use of personal information within Macquarie Group is appropriately limited to prevent misuse or unlawful disclosure of the information.
    </p>
    <p>
       If other organisations provide support services, we require them to appropriately safeguard the privacy of the information provided to them.
    </p>
    <p>
       Where the personal information we collect is no longer required, we delete the information or permanently de-identify it.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you have an account with us, your account information is password protected and we recommend you do not divulge your password to anyone. To further protect your personal information, your log-in time will automatically expire after a certain period of inactivity.
    </p>
    <h3>
       How you can access your information
    </h3>
    <p>
       You can contact us to request access to your information. In normal circumstances we will give you full access to your information. However, there may be some legal or administrative reasons to deny access. If access is denied, we will provide you with the reason why.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Dealing with Macquarie Group online
    </h3>
    <p>
       When you visit Macquarie websites you will browse anonymously unless you have logged into a client portal or accessed the website from a personalised communication from Macquarie.
    </p>
    <p>
       For all visitors to our web site, we use cookies to collect anonymous information such as the server your computer is logged on to, your browser type (for example, Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox), and your IP address. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically and required for using the Internet. We may also derive the general geographic area associated with an IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you are an anonymous visitor, the information we collect is not capable of personally identifying you.
    </p>
    <p>
       Once you have logged into a Macquarie portal, accessed our website from an e-mail or other personalised communication sent to you or provided us with personal information by completing a form online, we may be able to identify you. If we have identified you we may be able to link your identity to your previous anonymous browsing history and collect information about your future use of our websites, irrespective of how you access our sites (eg by clicking a link in an advertisement or from a third party website). In addition we may combine that information about your use of Macquarie websites with certain other online and offline information we have about you in order to tailor your online experience and provide you with further information. If you would prefer not to be identified you can delete the cookies and reconfigure the cookie preferences on your internet browser (see below).
    </p>
    <h3>
       Cookies
    </h3>
    <p>
       A 'cookie' is a packet of information placed on a user's computer by a website for record keeping purposes. Cookies are generally used on Macquarie Group sites to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        access online services - if you visit a Macquarie Group website and log into our secure areas we will use cookies to enable us to authorise your access
      </li>
      <li>
        manage advertising - we use advertising companies to deliver our online advertising. When you see one of our ads on a third party website, cookies are sometimes used to collect anonymous information about what pages you visit and the type of software you are using
      </li>
      <li>
        monitor traffic- we use tracking companies to gather anonymous information about how people are using the Macquarie site, this information includes time of visit, pages visited, and some system information about the type of computer you are using. We use this information to enhance the content and services offered on the site
      </li>
      <li>
        collect identifiable information about your use of our websites - if we have identified you as a result of you logging into a Macquarie client portal or accessing our website from an e-mail or other personalised communication sent to you or providing us with personal information by completing a form online.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences).
    </p>
    <p>
       If you disable the use of cookies on your web browser or remove or reject specific cookies from Macquarie Group websites or linked sites then you may not be able to gain access to all of the content and facilities on those websites.
