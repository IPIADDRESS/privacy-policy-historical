<p><strong>IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION
REQUESTED</strong></p>

<p>Where we need to collect personal data by law or under the terms
of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data
when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have
or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you
with services). In this case, we may have to cancel a service you
have booked with us but we will notify you if this is the case at
the time.</p>

<p><strong>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH
OTHERS</strong></p>

<p>We will not disclose personal information we hold about you to
any third party except where required by law or as follows: -</p>

<p>(i) to companies in the Macdonald Hotels &amp; Resorts
group;</p>

<p>(ii) to third parties who provide services to us, and act as
data processors for us;</p>

<p>(iii) to professional advisers including lawyers, bankers,
auditors and insurers;</p>

<p>(iv) to HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other
authorities who require reporting of processing activities in
certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Also in the event that we sell any business or assets, we may
disclose personal information we hold about you to the prospective
and actual buyer of such business or assets. If a change happens to
our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the
same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Please note that we do not allow our third-party service
providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only
permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes
and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE
EEA</strong></p>

<p>We do not intend to transfer any personal data we hold about you
to a country outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").</p>

<p>If however we do transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we
shall ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by
ensuring at least one of the following safeguards applies: -</p>

<ul>
<li>the countries to which it is transferred have been deemed to
provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the
relevant regulators;</li>

<li>we have put in place with the transferee specific contracts
approved by the relevant regulators which give personal data
similar protection to that it has in Europe; or</li>

<li>if the transferee is in the US, it is registered with the
Privacy Shield (or any similar replacement scheme) which requires
it to provide similar protection to personal data as is required in
Europe.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DATA SECURITY</strong></p>

<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent
your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed
in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit
access to your personal data to those employees, agents,
contractors and other third parties who have a business need to
know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions
and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>

<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected
personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable
regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

<p><strong>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
FOR?</strong></p>

<p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as
necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for
the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
requirements.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data,
we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal
data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or
disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process
your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes
through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see
under <strong>YOUR RIGHT TO ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND
YOUR OTHER RIGHTS/to request erasure</strong> below for further
information.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so
that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or
statistical purposes in which case we may use this information
indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

<p>We will take all reasonable steps to destroy, or erase from our
systems, all the personal information we hold about you when it is
no longer required.</p>

<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND YOUR
OTHER RIGHTS</strong></p>

<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data
protection laws in relation to your personal data as follows:.</p>

<ul>
<li>to request access to your personal data (commonly known as a
"data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy
of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are
lawfully processing it;</li>

<li>to request correction of the personal data that we hold about
you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we
hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy
of the new data you provide to us;</li>

<li>to request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to
ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good
reason for us continuing to process it. It also enables you to
request that we delete or remove your personal data where you have
successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or
where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with
local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply
with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will
be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your
request;</li>

<li>to object to processing of your personal data where we are
relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
there is something about your particular situation which makes you
want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts
on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
object where we are processing your personal data for direct
marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which
override your rights and freedoms;</li>

<li>to request restriction of processing your personal data. This
enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal
data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish
the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but
you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the
data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our
use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
legitimate grounds to use it;</li>

<li>to request transfer of your personal data to you or to a third
party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen,
your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
format. Note that this right only applies to automated information
which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used
the information to perform a contract with you; or</li>

<li>to withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent
to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to
provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if
this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please
contact us by using the contact details set out below under "HOW TO
CONTACT US" below or by emailing <a href="mailto:GDPR.Marketing@macdonald-hotels.co.uk">GDPR.Marketing@macdonald-hotels.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or
to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request
in these circumstances.</p>

<p>If you wish to exercise any of those rights we may need to
request specific information from you to help us confirm your
identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data
is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We
may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation
to your request to speed up our response.</p>

<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

<p><strong>MANAGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>We want you to give choices regarding use of your personal
information for marketing and advertising purposes. We have
established a privacy centre where you can view and make certain
decisions about your personal data use and if you wish to access
this please email us at GDPR.Marketing@macdonald-hotels.co.uk or
complete the online form found by visiting <a href="http://www.macdonaldhotels.co.uk/hear-from-us" target="_blank">www.macdonaldhotels.co.uk/hear-from-us</a>.</p>

are holding about you is inaccurate, out-of-date or incomplete,
please tell us by emailing us at <a href="mailto:GDPR.Marketing@macdonald-hotels.co.uk">GDPR.Marketing@macdonald-hotels.co.uk</a>
and we will rectify this.</p>

time to take account of changes in law or the needs of our
business. Please refer back to this page regularly to see any
changes or updates to this Policy.</p>
