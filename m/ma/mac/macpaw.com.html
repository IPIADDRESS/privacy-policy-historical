    <li>to investigate and help prevent security issues, fraud and abuse.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, MacPaw may use it for any business purpose. </p>

  <p>We only disclose Personal Data to third parties when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We use service providers who assist us in meeting business operations needs, including hosting, delivering, and improving our Products.

    <li>We have your explicit consent to share your Personal Data (if required).</li>
    <li>We believe it is necessary to investigate potential violations of the Terms of Products, to enforce those Terms of Products, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats against persons, property, or the systems on which we operate our Site and/or Products.</li>
    <li>We determine that the access, preservation, or disclosure of your Personal Data is required by law to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of MacPaw and users of our Site and/or Products, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including national security or law enforcement requests.</li>
    <li>We need to do so in connection with a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization, sale of some or all of our assets or stock, public offering of securities, or steps in consideration of such activities (e.g., due diligence). In these cases some or all of your Personal Data may be shared with or transferred to another entity, subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li>We may disclose Non-Personal Data publicly and to third parties – for example, in public reports about word usage, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of progress reports we may provide to users.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>MacPaw does not share your Personal Data with third parties for the purpose of enabling them to deliver their advertisements to you.</p>
  <p>MacPaw does not sell or rent your Personal Data.</p>
  <p><b>Third Parties’ Applications and Products</b></p>
  <p>Some third-party applications and services that work with us may ask for permission to access your information. Those applications will provide you with notice and request your consent in order to obtain such access or information. Please consider your selection of such applications and services, and your permissions, carefully.</p>
  <p>Some third parties’ embedded content or plugins on our Sites and/or Products, such as Facebook “Like” buttons, may allow their operators to learn that you have visited the Sites, and they may combine this knowledge with other data they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services that can identify you.</p>
  <p>Data collected by third parties through these apps and plugins is subject to each parties’ own policies. We encourage you to read those policies and understand how other companies use your data.</p>
  <p><b>E-mailing by MacPaw</b></p>
  <p>From time to time, we may want to contact you with information about product announcements, software updates, and special offers. We also may want to contact you with information about products and services from our business partners. </p>
  <p>We only send marketing communications to users with your prior consent.</p>
  <p>All MacPaw account holders will continue to receive transactional messages related to our Products, even if you unsubscribe from promotional emails.</p>
  <h2>Data storage, transfer, retention, and deletion</h2>
  <h3>Data Storage and Transfers</h3>
  <p>Information submitted to MacPaw will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States. When you use the Products on your computing device, user content you save will be stored locally on that device and synced with our servers. If you post or transfer any Information to or through our Sites and/or Products, you are agreeing to such information, including Personal Data and user content, being hosted and accessed in the United States.</p>
  <h3>Duration of Information Storage</h3>
  <p>You can remove your Personal Data from MacPaw at any time by emailing us with the respective request: <a href="mailto:support@macpaw.com">support@macpaw.com</a>. However, we may keep some of your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for our legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention and to comply with our legal obligations including tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations.</p>
  <h3>Safeguards</h3>
  <p>When you give us personal information, we take steps to make sure that it’s treated securely.</p>
  <p>Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are sent normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p>
  <p>We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit. This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.</p>
  <p>Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of technical, physical, and logical security safeguards. The security of the data stored locally in any of our Products installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device. We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use in connection with our Site and Products.</p>
  <p>The Company takes the security of your data very seriously and works to protect your data from loss, misuse and unauthorised access or disclosure.</p>
  <p>All staff and officers who handle Relevant Data are aware of this policy and have been given training in how to correctly collect, process, store and delete data. The Company holds a log of when staff training was undertaken and updates it on an annual basis.</p>
  <h3>Data Breaches</h3>
  <p>All breaches will be reported to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours, unless the data was anonymised or encrypted or if it has a particularly high risk.</p>
  <p>Breaches of this policy by staff, contractors, officers of the Company will be dealt with under the Company’s grievance and disciplinary policy and may lead to a disciplinary sanction.</p>
  <p>If MacPaw learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.</p>
  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>MacPaw uses, processes, and stores Personal Data, as necessary to perform our contract with you, and based on our legitimate interests in order to provide the Products and Services. We rely on your consent to process Personal Data to send promotional emails and to place cookies on your devices. In some cases, MacPaw may process Personal Data pursuant to legal obligation or to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
  <p>Individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) have certain rights in respect to their personal information, including the right to access, correct, or delete Personal Data we process through your use of the Sites, Software, and/or Products.

    <li>Object to us processing your Personal Data. It is your right to lodge an objection to the processing of your personal data by emailing: <a href="mailto:support@macpaw.com">support@macpaw.com</a> if you feel the “ground relating to your particular situation” apply.  The only reasons we will be able to deny your request is if we can show compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override your interest, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claims.</li>
    <li>You can ask us to stop using your Personal Data, including when we use your Personal Data to send you marketing emails. We only send marketing communications to users located in the EEA with your prior consent, and you may withdraw your consent at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found within MacPaw emails and changing your contact preferences.
