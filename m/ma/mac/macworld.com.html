</p><p>
<font size="+1">
Well, yes, to a presently limited but potentially explosive degree. While it's true that the idea of information-sharing is one of the cornerstones of the Net - and one of its charms - even the most vociferous civil libertarian agrees  there is cause for concern.

</p><p>
In mid-June the Federal Trade Commission held <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/privacy2/index.html">three days of hearings</a> on Net privacy, serving as prelude to the commission's recommendation to the Clinton Administration on whether the U.S. government or the information industry itself should legislate cyber privacy. That recommendation is due in September. Chances are good that Clinton will maintain his laissez-faire stance and put the responsibility square in the hands of the industry and consumers themselves.
 </p><p>

</p><blockquote>But what are we talking about here? What are the elements involved in questions of consumer privacy?</blockquote>
<p>

There are two primary issues. The first is the accessibility of currently existing databases. The second has to do with information about consumers  collected online (through voluntary registrations or by surreptitious little files called "cookies") and what happens to that information. Does it go into vast database storehouses which can then be accessed by people or agencies with no business snooping around in our personal lives? 
</p><p>

On the eve of the FTC hearings, Netscape and Microsoft jumped on the self-regulation bandwagon and announced that they would work with the World Wide Web Consortium, the Net's arbiter of standards, on a new privacy standard  called the Platform for Privacy Preferences, or P3. (For more, see the W3C's <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/privacy2/comments2/!w3c-ftc.htm">briefing package</a>.)  P3 would enable users to control via their Web browsers what personal information is accessible to Web sites. But make no mistake: This is not an altruistic offering. Netscape and Microsoft see P3 as a way to both ward off government intervention and soothe public nerves. 
</p><p>
Currently about 30 million Americans use the Internet. With issues of privacy abuse spreading like summer wildfires in California, new users may have second thoughts about riding the Web wave. And that's not good for business, the stock market, or the relationship with the Clinton Administration that industry centers like Silicon Valley currently enjoy. 
</p><p>
In this three-part series concluding July 10, we explore privacy on the Net. Here, we give you an overview of database accessibility. In Part Two we provide an in-depth look at cookie technology. In Part Three we tell you about Macworld Online's privacy policies. As one advocate said at a recent conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy, "If you are reluctant or embarrassed to show samples of what you're doing, then your ethics are in question."

</p><p>



<font size="+2">Database Accessibility</font>
</p><p>
Numerous stories have been written about how easy it is to track down someone's address or even a Social Security number. California Senator Dianne Feinstein was shocked to learn that a Los Angeles Times reporter had found her SS number and information on her real estate holdings on the Net. Andrew Shapiro, writing in the Nation magazine June 23, said it took him about 10 minutes to track down, for free, Ted Turner's SS number and Rush Limbaugh's home address.
</p><p>
No surprise there. We know that such information is available for the taking, if one knows his way around the Net. In the worst-case scenario, all our records could be accessed online, including medical data. A neighbor of mine, a parole officer, is up-in-arms that the county is using SS numbers as identification for its employee database. Is it far-fetched to believe that this database of public employees could ever be made public to you and me?  

While some may say it couldn't happen, consider the zealousness of the traditional press. 
</p><p>
<b>Public Databases on Newspaper Web Sites</b>
</p><p>Earlier this year I attended a conference on Ethics in New Media at a prestigious journalism think-tank. The majority of the attendees were editors of newspapers with Web sites. A healthy helping of these editors said there was absolutely nothing wrong - in fact they championed the idea - of providing online readers with access to public-record databases. 
</p><p>
Why not? they asked. If it's public record, what's the big deal? In the eyes of those editors, their newspapers would be providing readers with a service, that's all. 
</p><p>

That's all? Public-record databases contain everything from data on bankruptcy information to liens on property to divorce filings to whether a neighbor or colleague has been arrested for drunk driving or, worse, is registered as a child sex felon. For now it takes some effort to search these databases the "old-fashioned way" by going to the appropriate government offices. But what if that information was as easy to access as logging on to your local paper's Web site? Even more to the point, who's to say that information is correct? Consider the CD-ROM released last week that lists the locations (by Zip Code) of known child-sex offenders: Already it's been noted that one-third of the data is wrong.

</p><p>
To its credit, the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE), which cosponsored the workshop, listened to detractors of such a broad-based database-access policy, and in the draft edition of a New Media ethics statement cautioned members to be sensitive and responsible. It also charged the newspapers with making corrections in the databases when errors are detected. Of course that assumes there are no insensitive or unscrupulous editors and reporters, and it assumes errors will be caught before they harm an innocent reputation. 
</p><p>
<b>Safeguarding Our Constitutional Rights</b>
</p><p>
The ASNE  in no way supports the idea of preventing by legislation the gathering of such information or such databases, nor should it. To do so would be a violation of the First Amendment right of freedom of the press, as the ASNE strongly cautioned in a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/privacy2/comments1/comftc1.htm">position paper</a> presented to the  FTC during the  mid-June hearings. 
</p><p>
The specter of possible government control as played out at the hearings also spurred Lexis and other online database companies to propose guidelines of their own, which includes promises to screen those seeking online information to prevent possible abuses. Of course that too begs the question: Can such a promise really be kept?
</p><p>
And certainly, as mentioned above, the specter of legislative interference had the remarkable effect of being the Kris Kringle that brought Macy's and Gimbel's together, to use a "Miracle on 34th Street" analogy for the joining of rivals Netscape and Microsoft (in concert with 100 other software companies) in the creation of P3 standards. Of course P3 is not aimed at existing databases: It has to do with our next topic - the potential for abuse that the Web itself, as an emerging industry, poses.
</p><p>
<font size="+2">Web Marketing Model: Trolling for Information</font> 
</p><p>
Existing databases are one thing. New databases generated by Web publishers - and what's done with the information contained in them, now and in the future - are a whole new issue. 
</p><p>
Most every serious, commercial Web site, including Macworld Online, wants information about the people visiting its pages. Why wouldn't we? Print-based magazines and newspapers conduct reader surveys. The Nielsen ratings let TV networks know who's watching and who's not. Such information is crucial for circulation and advertising statistics, and for judging popularity and relevance of editorial content. For now the same criteria is the nature of the Web beast: The model is for advertising to pay to support what readers are getting online for free (aside from Internet hook-up fees, of course), and if what a Web site is offering is ignored in terms of content, then it's time for the editorial board to go back to the drawing board.
</p><p>
<b>Making a Point About Personal Information</b>
</p><p>
 Problem is, this new publishing medium is so new no one really knows how far it can go in the collection and nefarious reuse of personal data. 

"What we can collect online is awesome - it blows the mind. We can understand a tremendous amount about our customers - we can make a tremendous amount of inference" about what those customers are looking for, said Jason Olim of CDnow at the Seventh Conference on Computers, Freedom &amp; Privacy. "The online revolution is a marketer's dream." Olim was in no way championing the unbridled collection of private information. He was simply making a point.
</p><p>

On the Web, the marketing model works in two ways. The first is the simple fact of collecting information through an "opt-in" or voluntary registration form or survey that asks for key demographic data like income level, age, profession, buying habits - information that can be used in aggregate to inform potential advertisers. 
</p><p>
These same registration forms and surveys often ask for email addresses, phone numbers, even snail-mail addresses. Responsible Web administrators include a disclaimer as to what that direct-connect information will be used for. If that use includes delivery of email or other contact - from the Web site itself or from its advertisers - the responsible administrator additionally offers an "opt-out" clause: as in, "Yes, I'll register because I know you need to survive and I'm proud of who I am, but No, I'm clicking this opt-out box you've included on the form, so don't you dare send me anything in any mail form or call me."
</p><p>
One way to judge the ethics of a Web site is to look for an "opt-out" check box on registration forms and surveys. But that's not necessarily the end of the story.
As the Web grows, so grows the lure of database swapping, or rental. Again, this is nothing new - where do you think junk and sometimes not-so-junky snail-mail catalogs and the like originate?  Of course that doesn't make it right; it just makes it part of the status quo of marketing in America. 
</p><p>
<b>Cookies Anyone?</b>
</p><p>
The unsettling thought is the real idea that all that personal information generated by the most popular Web sites could someday be housed in huge databases. In other words, in vast storehouses whose contents could be available to, well, you know, any and all who have the key. Call this the milk into which one could dunk a cookie.
</p><p>
Cookies are the wild card in Web privacy concerns. Cookies, a cute name for a tiny but powerful server-client file, can "track" where you go on a Web site. When you first log on, a cookie only knows that you have arrived. But once there, you're fair game. Let's take a real-life example - you're shopping at a local department store. As you stroll through the store, a clerk quietly drops a little piece of paper in your pocket that identifies where you've been, like "cosmetics" or "men's shoes." If you buy something, that too is recorded and dropped into your pocket. The clerk in our example is tagging your sojourns, just as a cookie does when it makes note that you have clicked on a page or an ad.  
</p><p>
Cookies, in responsible hands, are treats. Their use can save you time and keystrokes. They can identify you as a registered user of, say, the Macworld Online Message Board or a registered reader of HotWired or the New York Times. Cookies also make what you see more interesting, in terms of advertising: Cookies are used to rotate and to select ad banners. For example, when you look for information on Mac products on a search engine, you might be "served up" an ad banner from Apple or Adobe or Claris.
</p><p>
<b>An Invisible Eye on Where We Surf</b>
</p><p>
But let's talk of deeper, darker concerns - like the marriage of mega-database collection and cookie-tracking technology. And let's use an example offered by FTC commissioner Christine Varney at the Conference on Computers, Freedom &amp; Privacy - as in, what if you are searching for information on products available for the treatment of a medical condition, say AIDs. And what if the site you're on throws your visit - via your cookie - into its database, which just happens to be part of a mega-database. 
</p><p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#000000">
<table border="0" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="2">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" align="CENTER">
<font size="+2">

of privacy resources
</font></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


</p><p>Now let's say that the mega-database makes the connection between your cookie (as a number) with your name and email address, which you innocently gave to some other site that shares its database information with the mega-database in question.
</p><p>
And what if that information is then pulled up by a third party, risking, as Varney said, "exposure that [your] visit to AIDs sites could be marketed to insurance companies, alternative medicine providers, or political organizations."
</p><p>
That said - and it's a mouthful - where do we go from here? The answer is fairly straight-forward: Who knows? For now the Clinton Administration is putting its trust in the online industry to make surfing safe for you and me. But that's a long-term solution.
</p><p>
 As far as short-term fixes go, stay tuned for Part II when we explore the world of cookies and how they crumble.
