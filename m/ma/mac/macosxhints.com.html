<h2>Mac Publishing Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>At Mac Publishing, we understand that privacy is important, and we’ve created this policy to give you information about how we collect and use personal information. Our policy is divided into three main sections: Section 1 describes how we collect and use data from users of the Mac Publishing family of Web sites: Macworld.com, Maccentral.com, Macuser.com, Macosxhints.com, Playlistmag.com, and Javaworld.com. Section 2 describes how we collect and use data from subscribers to the print and electronic editions of Macworld magazine. And because Mac Publishing is owned by International Data Group (IDG) and is part of the IDG Publishing Network of technology publications, Section 3 presents the privacy policy for the IDG Publishing Network.</p>
<p>We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your feedback. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, we ask that you contact us at:</p>
<p>Customer Service<br> Mac Publishing, LLC<br> 501 Second St.<br> San Francisco, CA 94107<br> e-mail: <a href="mailto:sitehelp@macworld.com">sitehelp@macworld.com</a></p>
<p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to use personally identifying information in ways that are different from the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected, our Web site will contain a special notice about the changes. Each version of this privacy policy will be identified by its effective date, which you can find at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h2>1. Mac Publishing Online Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Mac Publishing collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use our Web sites. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data. Please note that Macworld magazine subscriber data is maintained separately from data gathered from Mac Publishing’s online users. This means that users of our Web sites who also subscribe to Macworld magazine, in either print or electronic form, should read both this section and Section 2 (Macworld Subscriber Privacy Policy) in order to have a full understanding of our privacy practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Information we collect and how we use it</b></p>
<p>When you visit one of our Web sites, Mac Publishing collects several forms of usage data, including:</p>
<p></p><ul type="circle"> <li><b>Log data</b>. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.</li> <li><b>Cookie data</b>. When you visit one of our Web sites, Mac Publishing or one of our IDG affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more "cookies"—small files containing a string of characters—to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with Mac Publishing, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site. If you haven't registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.</li> <li><b>Traffic and advertising data</b>. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable us to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit our Web sites. </li> </ul><p></p>
<p>Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site. Or you can use third-party anonymizer services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered on our Web sites.</p>
<p>The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following :</p>
<p></p><ol type="1" start="1"><li>To improve the content and design of our Web sites. </li><li>To enable our audit bureau to verify our claims of traffic to the sites. </li><li>To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of the sites for their ad campaigns. </li><li>To help us understand more about the interests of our users, so that we can offer goods and services we believe may be of interest. </li></ol><p></p>
<p>Many portions of the Mac Publishing Web sites can be used without registering or giving us any personal information such as (but not limited to) your name and e-mail address. However, Mac Publishing does collect personally identifying information regarding our online users, including in the following ways:</p>
<p></p><ul type="circle"> <li>When you provide it to us, such as (but not limited to) by entering a contest, becoming a registered member, signing up for a newsletter or tutorial, or otherwise contacting us.</li> <li>When you provide it to a company that powers a portion of our site or provides a special feature, such as a contest registration, that appears on our site.</li> <li>When you provide information about yourself or your company to Mac Publishing in connection with a subscription order, or when you provide information to any other IDG Publishing Network affiliate, that information may be included in your Mac Publishing user record, if one exists. </li> <li>If you have previously registered with another IDG Publishing Network affiliate and you begin to fill out certain forms on a Mac Publishing Web site, the site may recognize you and automatically complete the form, and this auto-fill data will then be included in your Mac Publishing user record.</li> <li>If you have provided information to Mac Publishing, from time to time we may enhance that information with other information that we collect from third-party sources. </li> </ul><p></p>
<p>The personal information we collect may be used in a number of ways, including the following:</p>
<p></p><ul type="circle"> <li>To improve the content of the Mac Publishing Web sites, including by allowing our editors to consult with readers.</li> <li>To communicate with users about registration and other customer service issues.</li> <li>To promote products and services of Mac Publishing, our parent company IDG, and our sibling IDG companies, as described in more detail below.</li> <li>To conduct research surveys on behalf of Mac Publishing, IDG, and its subsidiaries and affiliates.</li> </ul><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Information sharing </b></p>
<p>Mac Publishing may share aggregated, nonpersonal information, such as Web site traffic figures, with third parties. This aggregated information does not identify you individually. We may share personal information with your consent or in order to provide products or services you have requested. In addition, by using the site you agree that we may also share personal information in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<p></p><ul type="circle"> <li>We may use or disclose personal information if we have a good-faith belief that the disclosure is reasonably necessary (a) to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) to enforce agreements we have with you, (c) to address fraud or security issues, or (d) to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Mac Publishing or our employees or customers.</li> <li>We may share personal information with trusted affiliates or third parties, such as credit card processors or fulfillment providers, who process information or perform services on our behalf.</li> <li>If you submit personal information on a portion of one of our sites that is operated by a third party, such as our price comparison service, we may share the information you submit with the third party, and the information may be used by that party as permitted under that party’s privacy policy. Mac Publishing and its parent and affiliate companies are not responsible for the third party’s actions or policies. Portions of the sites operated by third parties normally include a “Powered by” logo naming the third party, or have forms that include links to the third party’s privacy policy.</li> <li>We may transfer personal information from your user record to your subscriber record, if one exists, provided that we also transfer any preferences you have set for how that personal information is used. Any information transferred to the subscriber database will be governed by Section 2 (Macworld Subscriber Privacy Policy).</li> <li>As part of the IDG Publishing Network, we share personal information with our parent company, IDG, for promotional and other purposes.
