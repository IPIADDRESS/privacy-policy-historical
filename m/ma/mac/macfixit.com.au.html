<li> let you know if we need to disclose your personal information to anyone else (including anyone overseas) and if so, in what circumstances this might occur;</li>
<li> keep your personal information secure;</li>
<li> promptly respond to any request by you not to receive direct marketing material from us;</li>
<li> make sure your personal information is kept accurate and up to date and to properly dispose of any personal information which is no longer required by us; and</li>

<h3>Why do we require your personal information?</h3>
<p> There are various reasons why we might need to collect, hold, use or disclose your personal information and this will depend upon the specific services that we are providing to you but we will tell you the main reason for asking for your personal information at the time when we ask you to provide it.</p>
<p> Usually, the main reason that we will need to collect your personal information will be relating to a service that we are providing to you or are about to provide to you and for contacting you in relation to those services.

<li> preventing fraud and other criminal activities;</li>
<li> to assist us to run our business and to improve our services and performance, including staff training, accounting, risk management, record keeping, archiving, systems development, developing new products and services and undertaking planning, research and statistical analysis; and</li>
<li> to comply with our legal obligations.</li>There is no obligation for you to provide us with any of your personal information but if you choose not to provide us with your personal information, we may not be able to provide the information, goods or services that you require.
<h3>How do we collect your personal information?</h3>

<p> Where we are collecting your personal information, we will remind you of the following at the time of collecting your personal information:</p>
<p> (i) our details, including our contact details;</p>
<p> (ii) that we are collecting your information and the reasons why we are collecting your information;</p>

<h3>How we use cookies</h3>
<p> A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive.

<h3>How can you access your personal information?</h3>
<p> Usually we will be able to provide you with access to your personal information upon receipt of your written request, either by email sent to Macfixit Australia Pty Ltd, at&nbsp; <a href="https://www.macfixit.com.au/contacts">https://www.macfixit.com.au/contacts</a> or by post sent to Macfixit Australia, 2 Lothian Street, North Melbourne 3051, and confirmation of your identity.</p>
<p> There are some limited circumstances in which we may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information when requested. Such circumstances might include where access would pose a serious threat to the life, health or safety of another person or where such access would unreasonably impact on the privacy of others.</p>
<p> Where you request access to your personal information, we will respond to any such request within a reasonable period after the request is made and if possible, we will provide you with access to your information in the manner requested by you, if specified. In any event, we will take all reasonable steps to give you access to your information in a way that meets your needs.</p>
<p> If we deny you access to your personal information for any reason, or if we are unable to provide you with access to your information in the manner requested by you, then we will provide you with a written notice confirming:</p>
<p> (a) the reason for such refusal; and</p>
<p> (b) the procedure to complain about the refusal.</p>
<p> We may recover from you our reasonable costs of supplying you with access to your personal information but we will not charge you for any request you might make to access your information.</p>
<h3>How can you seek to correct your personal information?</h3>
<p> We do what we can to ensure that the information we hold about you is accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant and not misleading. To assist us to do this, please ensure that you provide us with correct information at the time you provide it to us and immediately inform us if your details change at any time. If we are concerned that any of your information is inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date, irrelevant or misleading, or if you request that we correct any of your information, then we will take all reasonable steps to correct the information to ensure that it is accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant and not misleading in the context of the purpose for which it is held.</p>
<p> If we correct any of your personal information and that information has previously been disclosed to another entity that is required to comply with the APPs, then, upon your request to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify that other entity of the correction unless such notification is impracticable or unlawful.</p>
<p> If we refuse to correct your personal information following a request by you to do so, then we will provide you with a written notice confirming:</p>
<p> (a) the reason for such refusal; and</p>
<p> (b) the procedure to complain about the refusal.</p>
<p> If we refuse to correct your personal information following a request by you to do so and you request that we associate with the information a statement that the information is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading then we will take reasonable steps to associate the statement with the information so that the statement is apparent to users of the information.</p>
<p> We will respond to any requests regarding the correction of your personal information within a reasonable period after the request is made.</p>
<p> We will not charge you for any request to correct your personal information, nor will we pass on to you any costs incurred by us in correcting your personal information or for associating a statement with your personal information.</p>
