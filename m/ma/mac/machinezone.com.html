For more information on how we utilize cookies and other tracking technologies, please refer to <a href="#adidentifiers">Ad identifiers, cookies, and similar technologies</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="adidentifiers"></a>3.   AD IDENTIFIERS, COOKIES, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES </h1>
<p>To provide our games, websites and interest-based advertising, we use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies. This section describes our use of these technologies and how you can manage your preferences.</p>
<div class="wrap-collapsible">
    <input id="collapsible1" class="toggle" type="checkbox">
    <label for="collapsible1" class="lbl-toggle">Find out more</label>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
    <div class="content-inner">
<p>How do ad identifiers, cookies, and similar technologies work? </p>
<p>Ad identifiers are non-permanent identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising (the ‘IDFA’), which are uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your desktop computer or mobile device. </p>
<p>When you access the Service, we collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and Service; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; and (iii) manage advertising. We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, will use Log Files and other tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information over time and across different websites following your use of the Service, including cookies, WiFi information, IP addresses, geo-location, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, Service state and the date and time of activity on our Services, and other similar information. In some cases, we will associate this information with your user ID number for our internal use. Our Service currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) settings in your web browser and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For further details regarding DNT, visit donottrack.us.</p>
<p>We also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your in-Service preferences and speed up load times.</p>
<p><a name="howtoadjust"></a>How to adjust your preferences for interest-based advertising</p>
<p>You can choose to prevent your device's ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary from device to device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings.</p>
<p>You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit adobe.com and make changes at the privacy settings panel. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of playing our Services, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your Service activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our Services or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.</p>
<p>We also use Google Analytics, who uses cookies to help the website analyze how users use the Service and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For more information on how Google uses this data when you visit our Site or use our Services, visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and to opt out of Google Analytics, visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.</p>
<p>The NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) allows for the central opting out of all its members’ cookies from a single opt-out page. If you prefer not to receive relevant advertising on web pages, please click on the following link: networkadvertising.org/choices/. If you delete your cookies, use a different browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.</p>

    <div class="content-inner">
<p>What information do we use for marketing?</p>
<p>We use information about you to try to make sure you only see marketing from us that might be of interest to you, including:</p>
<ul><li>ad identifiers and other information collected from your device. For more information, see 
<a href="#adidentifiers">Ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies</a>;</li><li>the games you play and information about how you interact with our Services;</li><li>your age, country or region, and gender; and</li><li>other information that we might acquire from our third party marketing partners or other third parties who have obtained your consent or have another legal basis to share that information with us.</li></ul>
<p>Opting out of direct marketing from us</p>
<p>You can exercise choices over the direct marketing we send you in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>you can withhold your consent for us to send you direct marketing emails by opting out when we collect your email address or by electing not to share your email address with us when you first create an account using your Facebook details;</li><li>you can remove yourself from receiving email marketing from us at any time by simply clicking the unsubscribe link in any direct marketing email we send to you or sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@mz.com">support@mz.com</a>; and</li><li>to disable interest-based advertising, please see 
<a href="#howtoadjust">How to adjust your preferences for interest based advertising. </a></li></ul>
<p>You should note that if you opt out of receiving interest based or targeted advertising, you will still see advertising and you may see advertising for our Services, but that advertising will not be targeted using your personal information.</p>
<p>Third Parties’ Direct Marketing</p>
<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by “opting in” to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our sites.</p>
<p>Your access to the Services will not be affected if you do not “opt in” to receive information from such third parties. </p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to: Customer Service c/o Machine Zone, Inc., 2225 E. Bayshore Road, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94303.</p>

<p>Consent. Where we process data based on your consent, we will ask for your explicit consent. You may withdraw consent at any time, but that will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your personal data prior to such withdrawal. </p>
<p>While you can withdraw your consent or object to certain types of processing at any time in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, please note that if you play our games we will still collect some personal data about you and process it as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

<h1><a name="sharing"></a>5.  SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h1>
<p>We share your personal data with our Affiliates including in the United States.

<h2>(a) Third party service providers</h2>

<h2>(c) European Countries Users’ Rights</h2>
<p>If you are located in a country in the European Union, the European Economic Area, or Switzerland, you have certain rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you, which we detail below, and which are subject to exemptions under applicable data privacy laws. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances as set out in more detail below. We also set out how to exercise those rights. Please note that we may require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights. We will respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances). To exercise any of your rights, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@mz.com">support@mz.com</a>.</p>

<h3>(i) Deletion of your personal data </h3>
<p>In some circumstances, you may request that we erase some of the personal data we hold about you. Should you wish to have your personal information deleted, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mz.com">support@mz.com</a>. </p>
<p>Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for erasure. Please note that in order to process your request you must delete our games from your mobile devices and clear our cookies from any device where you have played our games. When we delete any information, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives. Please note, however, we may still retain some or all of that information for other purposes such as maintaining financial records, protecting or enforcing legal rights, maintaining marketing suppression lists or for technical reasons such as maintaining technical security or our database integrity. We may also retain your information in an anonymised form. </p>
<h3>(ii) Access and portability </h3>
<p>You have a right to know what information we hold about you and in some cases to have the information communicated to you. If you wish to exercise this right please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mz.com">support@mz.com</a> and let us know that you wish to exercise your right of access and what information in particular you would like to receive. Please note that we may not be able to provide all the information you ask for, for instance if the information includes personal information about another person. </p>
<p>In some circumstances, you may request the data we process based on consent or to perform our contract with you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or to request we transfer such personal data to another party. Your rights are subject to exemptions under applicable data privacy laws.</p>
<p>If you wish for us to transfer the personal data to another party, please ensure you detail that party and note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. We are not responsible for the security of the personal data or its processing once received by the third party. </p>
<p>We also may not provide you with certain data if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the personal data we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property) as permitted under applicable data protection rights. </p>
<h3>(iii) Correction </h3>
<p>You have the right to correct any personal data held about you that is inaccurate. Where you request correction, please explain in detail why you believe the personal data we hold about you to be inaccurate or incomplete so that we can assess whether a correction is required. </p>
<h3>(iv) Restriction of processing to storage only </h3>
<p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal data we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances, e.g. whilst we are considering whether it should be corrected or deleted or, based on your objection, whether we should permanently stop processing. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal data, we may use it again if there are valid grounds for us to do so (e.g. for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). </p>
<h3>(v) Objection </h3>
<p>You have the right to object to our processing of data about you other than where required to perform under the Terms of Use, e.g. in order to send you promotions and special offers marketing.</p>
<p>You also have the right to object to our processing of data about you by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@mz.com">support@mz.com</a> in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>We are processing the data we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you object to such processing. Please provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess whether there is a compelling overriding interest in us continuing to process such data or we need to process it in relation to legal claims. </li><li>We are processing the data on the basis of historical/scientific research or statistics and you have a particular reason to object. Your right would not apply where we have been tasked with and it is necessary for us to undertake such processing in the public interest.</li></ul>
<h3>(vi) Complaints </h3>
<p>In the event that you wish to make a complaint about how we process your personal data, please contact us in the first instance at <a href="mailto:privacy@mz.com">privacy@mz.com</a> and we will endeavor to deal with your request. This is without prejudice to your right to launch a claim with the data protection supervisory authority in the EU country in which you live or work where you think we have infringed data protection laws.</p>
