<h3>Security</h3>
<p>MT uses extensive and sophisticated secure technology to protect your data and transmissions between you and MT.

In that case, your ability to opt out of the new policy will be determined by applicable laws.</p>
<h3>Business Transfer</h3>
<p>We may, in the future, sell or otherwise transfer some or all of our assets or equity to a third party.  Your personally identifiable information and other information we obtain from you via the Website or the Application may be disclosed to any potential or actual third party purchasers of such assets or equity and may be among the assets transferred.</p>

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website and Application and does not govern activities on linked websites or applications.
