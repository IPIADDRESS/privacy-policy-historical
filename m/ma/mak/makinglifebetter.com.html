							<u>UNILEVER PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</u>

							<li>We value the trust that you place in us by giving us your personal information. We will always use your personal information in a way that is fair and worthy of that trust.</li>
							<li>You are entitled to clear information about how we use your personal information. We shall always be transparent with you about what information we collect, what we do with it, with whom we share it and whom you should contact if you have any concerns.</li>
							<li>If you have any concerns about how we use your personal information, we will work with you to promptly resolve those concerns.</li>
							<li>We will take all reasonable steps to protect your information from misuse and keep it secure.</li>
							<li>We will comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations and we will co-operate with data protection authorities.&nbsp; In the absence of data protection legislation, we will act in accordance with generally accepted principles governing data protection.
<br></li>
						</ol>
						<h2 align="center"><u>UNILEVER PRIVACY POLICY</u></h2>
						<p><em>Last Updated: March 2013</em></p>
						<p>Unilever is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is protected.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy explains the types of personal information we collect and how we use, disclose and protect that information.</p>
						<h2 class="title">What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</h2>
						<div class="desc">
							<p>This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected by the Unilever Group of companies in connection with the services they offer. Find out more about the Unilever Group at <a href="http://unilever.com/aboutus/">http://unilever.com/aboutus/</a>. This includes information collected offline through our Careline and consumer call centres, direct marketing campaigns, sweepstakes and competitions, and online through our websites, branded pages on third party platforms and applications accessed or used through such websites or third party platforms which are operated by or on behalf of the Unilever Group (“<strong>Unilever Sites</strong>”).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into and forms part of the terms and conditions of use of the applicable Unilever Site.&nbsp; For information about the Unilever Group company responsible for protecting your personal information, see <a class="readMore" href="#rights"><strong>Your privacy rights and who to contact</strong></a> below.</p>
							<br>
							<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information practices of:
<br>		<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; third party companies (including, without limitation, their websites, platforms and/or applications) which we do not own or control; or
<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individuals that Unilever does not manage or employ.
<br>		<br>
These Third Party Sites may have their own privacy policies and terms and conditions. We encourage you to read them before using those Third Party Sites.
<br></p>
						</div>
						<h2 class="title">Your consent</h2>
						<div class="desc">
							<p>Unilever will not collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most cases, we will ask for your consent explicitly but, in some cases, we may infer consent from your actions and behaviour.&nbsp; By using a Unilever Site, you are consenting to the relevant Unilever Group company collecting, using and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<br>		<br>
We may ask you to provide additional consent if we need to use your personal information for purposes not covered by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; You are not obliged to provide such consent but if you decide not to then your participation in certain activities may be restricted.&nbsp; If you provide additional consent, the terms of that consent shall prevail in the event of any conflict with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
<br>		<br>
If you do not agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in this way, please do not use the Unilever Sites or otherwise provide Unilever with personal information.&nbsp;
<br></p>

						<h2 class="title">Children</h2>

 						<input type="button" value="Update Child's Info" class="btnStyle" onclick="javascript:location='kids_up.asp';">	

						<br><br>
							<p>The majority of Unilever Sites are designed and intended for use by adults.&nbsp; Where a Unilever Site is intended for use by a younger audience, we will obtain consent from a parent or guardian before we collect personal information where we feel it is appropriate to do so or where it is required by applicable data protection laws and regulations (the age at which consent is necessary varies from country to country).&nbsp; If you are a child over the age where parental consent is required in your country, you should review the terms of this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian to make sure you understand and accept them.&nbsp;
<br>		<br>
If we discover that we have collected information without consent from a parent or guardian where such consent should have been obtained, we will delete that information as soon as possible.
<br>		<br>
Access to certain parts of the Unilever Sites and/or eligibility to receive prizes, samples or other rewards may be limited to users over a certain age. We may use your personal information to carry out age verification checks and enforce any such age restrictions.</p>
