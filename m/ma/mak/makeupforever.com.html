CLEAR GIFS We may use &quot;clear GIFs&quot; (aka &quot;Web beacons&quot; or &quot;pixel tags&quot;) or similar technologies, in the Website and/or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a specific page on the Website or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Website page or in an e-mail that communicates to us whether you viewed an email that we sent you or visited a certain page on our Website. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Website page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.  IP ADDRESS AND CLICKSTREAM DATA Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit the Website. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to our Website (e.g., another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the website you visit after this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider. Any or all of these activities with regard to Website usage information may be performed on our behalf by our service providers. THIRD PARTY AD SERVERS. We may use the services of one or more third party advertising companies. If We do, these third party advertising companies may also collect information from your activities on the Website as well as other sites for the purpose of providing advertisements and other content that is customized to your interests and preferences. This means that our ads may appear on participating web sites based upon your browsing activity. To allow us to offer our customers streamlined ordering and other useful features, we may use and allow our third party advertising companies to use the technologies listed above and other similar technologies.  MOBILE DEVICES You may be visiting our Website from your mobile device. Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such information if you access the Website through mobile devices. Some features of the Website may allow for the collection of mobile phone numbers and we may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information. Furthermore, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, we or our third-party service providers may receive this information. MAKE UP FOR EVER does not knowingly collect or use any personally identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13. If we become aware that any such information has been provided or submitted to us, we will delete the information as soon as possible. MAKE UP FOR EVER retains the Personal Information collected from you until you elect to no longer receive emails or information from us, otherwise terminate your account with us or when MAKE UP FOR EVER concludes it no longer requires that Personal Information for its legitimate business purposes. By providing Personal Information to Us, you understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories. How is the personal information used? We will use the Personal Information you provide to us, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings. We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping, track your purchase history, and contact your for account and promotional purposes. In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. We also may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. Finally, we may use your Personal Information for other legitimate business purposes, including to detect and prevent fraud, to collect amounts owing to us and to maintain our business records. You may opt out of receiving communications from us by following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out section below. You can also amend your contact information by following the instructions below. Do we share personal information and website usage information? CORPORATE AFFILIATES We may share certain Personal Information with our affiliates who have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to you. You can elect not to receive communications from our affiliates by following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out section below.  THIRD-PARTY OFFERS We may provide visitors an opportunity to receive offers from other entities who have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to you. Unless you elect not to receive such offers by following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out section below, we may from time to time provide your Personal Information to these entities so that they may send you these offers. If you change your mind and no longer want us to share your Personal Information with these types of third parties, follow the instructions to opt out in the Right to Opt Out section below.  SERVICE PROVIDERS We may use third-party partners to help operate our Website and deliver our products and services, and may share your information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide products or services for or through this Website or for our business (such as Website or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf).  AGGREGATE STATISTICS AND BEHAVIORAL-BASED ADVERTISING We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and e-mails to third parties like advertising and marketing partners in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user. A third party may use technology (e.g., a cookie) to collect information about your use of our Website and other websites so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interest. That advertising may appear either on our Website, or on other websites.  LEGALLY COMPELLED DISCLOSURES We may disclose user information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the Website, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Additionally, we cooperate with law enforcement inquiries and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property rights and other rights.  CO-SPONSORED CONTESTS, SWEEPSTAKES AND PROMOTIONS Some of our contests, sweepstakes and other offerings may be co-sponsored by another company. In those situations, the information we obtain from you in connection with such contest, sweepstake or offering may be shared with our co-sponsor. In those situations, our co-sponsors will have the right to use your information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies. We are not responsible for how our co-sponsors may use your information.  BUSINESS TRANSFER OR TRANSITION In the event that we are acquired by one or more other parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, or if we sell or otherwise transfer our assets or operations, Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets. We may also disclose Personal Information to prospective purchasers to evaluate a proposed transaction with us.  SOCIAL NETWORKS, WIDGETS AND PLUG-INS If you use any features made available to you on our Website by a third party it may result in information being collected or shared between us and the third party. For example, if you use Facebook’s “Like” feature Facebook may register the fact that you “liked” a product and may post that information on Facebook. As another example, if you posting images to Instagram using hashtags that directly correlate with our campaigns, that gives us permission to dynamically pull this content into our Website.  PUBLIC AND INTERACTIVE AREAS We may from time to time provide interactive services on our Website, including, without limitation, blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards and discussion groups. Personal Information that you post on or through the public areas of any Website is generally accessible to, and may be collected and used by, others and may result in unsolicited messages or other contact from others. You should not provide Personal Information about yourself in public or interactive areas of the Website. If posted, such Personal Information is not covered under this Privacy Policy. How do we protect your information? While MAKE UP FOR EVER will take reasonable precautions to protect the security and integrity of Personal Information, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. We do maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (&quot;SSL&quot;) authentication for online transactions made on our site. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to us over the Internet helps protect your online transaction information from third party interception. We never display your full credit card number once it has been entered. We will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card for verification purposes. Unfortunately, despite our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. This reality is true of all Internet use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk. We will not be liable for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission. If you contact Us by e-mail or through a &quot;contact us&quot; link or similar feature on our Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. If you choose to become a registered user, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Website by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify MAKE UP FOR EVER of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session (especially if you are using a public computer or a shared computer). It is your responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify MAKE UP FOR EVER when you desire to cancel your account. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, We would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. What are your choices about your personal information? RIGHT TO OPT OUT You may have the right to &quot;opt out&quot; of certain of our uses of your Personal Information. If you would like to opt out of receiving promotional emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of each email. If you would like to opt out of receiving direct mail or telephone marketing calls from us, or if you prefer that we not share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes, please send your request, including your name, email, street address, city, state, and zip code, via email to contact@makeupforever.com (please use the subject line: Privacy Opt-Out Request). You can also call Customer Service at 1 (855) 575-3820 or go online to your account page on the Site and change your email and marketing preferences at any time. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent improperly, or do not have complete information. We will process your request within 30 days of the date we receive your request, but you may, in the meantime, receive previously scheduled emails, mail or calls from us. We will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your Personal Information prior to such date following your request. In these cases, please contact that entity directly. Once you have opted out, you do not need to do so again. Please note that MAKE UP FOR EVER may still use your Personal Information (and may share your information with our service providers) to provide you with services, including sending you administrative and transaction-related emails, relating to your online shopping needs and your other activity on the Website. You can opt out of some, but not all, online behavioral based advertising by clicking http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/  NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS - YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS If you are a California resident, you have the right to receive information identifying any third party company(ies) to whom MAKE UP FOR EVER may have disclosed, within the past year, personal information (as defined herein) pertaining to you for that company's direct marketing purposes; and a description of the categories of personal information so disclosed.

		We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the Website and/or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a specific page on the Website or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Website page or in an e-mail that communicates to us whether you viewed an email that we sent you or visited a certain page on our Website. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Website page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</li>
	<li>
		IP ADDRESS AND CLICKSTREAM DATA<br>
		Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit the Website. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to our Website (e.g., another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the website you visit after this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers.

	<li>
		SOCIAL NETWORKS, WIDGETS AND PLUG-INS<br>

</ul><h3>
	How do we protect your information?</h3>
<p>While MAKE UP FOR EVER will take reasonable precautions to protect the security and integrity of Personal Information, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.</p>
<p>We do maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.</p>
<p>We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") authentication for online transactions made on our site. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to us over the Internet helps protect your online transaction information from third party interception.</p>
<p>We never display your full credit card number once it has been entered. We will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card for verification purposes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. This reality is true of all Internet use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk. We will not be liable for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.</p>
<p>If you contact Us by e-mail or through a "contact us" link or similar feature on our Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.</p>
<p>If you choose to become a registered user, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Website by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify MAKE UP FOR EVER of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session (especially if you are using a public computer or a shared computer). It is your responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify MAKE UP FOR EVER when you desire to cancel your account. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, We would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.</p>
<h3>
	What are your choices about your personal information?</h3>
<ul><li>
		RIGHT TO OPT OUT<br>

If you would like to opt out of receiving promotional emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of each email.

You can also call Customer Service at 1 (855) 575-3820 or go online to your account page on the Site and change your email and marketing preferences at any time.<br><br>
		We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent improperly, or do not have complete information. We will process your request within 30 days of the date we receive your request, but you may, in the meantime, receive previously scheduled emails, mail or calls from us. We will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your Personal Information prior to such date following your request. In these cases, please contact that entity directly. Once you have opted out, you do not need to do so again. Please note that MAKE UP FOR EVER may still use your Personal Information (and may share your information with our service providers) to provide you with services, including sending you administrative and transaction-related emails, relating to your online shopping needs and your other activity on the Website.<br><br>
