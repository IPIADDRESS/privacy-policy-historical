<font class="verdana11"><b>Organization: BBServers</b>
                  <p><span style="font-size:11;">BBServers believes that 
                    privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of Internet commerce. 
                    Our status as an Internet merchant account holder and certified 
                    payment gateway holder requires us to have a stringent policy regarding 
                    all of the information that we collect. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:11;">Your use of this site or BBServers’s 
                    services constitutes acceptance of these terms and conditions. 
                    If you do not agree with these policies, please cease using 
                    this site immediately. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:11;">These terms were last revised 
                    on November 04, 2005. BBServers reserves the right to amend 
                    these policies from time to time. If such amendments affect 
                    how BBServers uses or discloses personal information 
                    already held by BBServers in a material and adverse way 
                    over and above previous express or implied consent, BBServers 
                    will contact you to obtain consent. Notwithstanding the terms 
                    of this policy, the collection, use, and disclosure of personal 
                    information may be made outside of the terms herein to the 
                    extent provided for in the Canadian Personal Information Protection 
                    and Electronic Documents Act, and other relevant Canadian 
                    and Ontario legislation in effect from time to time. These 
                    exemptions include, without limitation, publicly available 
                    information, or information disclosed for criminal or civil 
                    investigations or compliance with law or court orders. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:11;">BBServers takes reasonable 
                    precautions to ensure your privacy on the terms contained 
                    in this policy. BBServers uses reasonable efforts to, 
                    but cannot totally prevent, unintended disclosures by such 
                    means as hackers and other unauthorized individuals, and inadvertent 
                    or illicit employee actions. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:11;"><b>Cardholder provided Information: 
                    <br>
                    </b>Our electronic purchase service requires that cardholders 
                    provide contact information (including without limitation: 
                    name, address, city, state or province, postal code, country, 
                    telephone and email), and financial information (including 
                    without limitation: name on credit card, credit card number 
                    and expiry date), and ordering information. This information 
                    is collected and used to process the transaction and for internal 
                    accounting and other procedures. Following a transaction, 
                    we may contact cardholders by phone or email for security 
                    purposes. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:11;"><b>Information Automatically 
                    Collected: <br>
                    </b>Our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source 
                    address that a page request is coming from, your IP address 
                    or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the 
                    referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. 
                    The IP addresses we collect on our electronic purchase service 
                    are linked to personally identifiable information. This is 
                    collected in order to combat fraud during the purchase process. 
                    We also use this data to better understand Web site usage 
                    in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site 
                    users prefer. Automatically collected information is also 
                    used for the same purposes as cardholder supplied and merchant 
                    supplied information. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:11;"><b>Sharing of Information: <br>
                    </b>Certain information submitted through the electronic purchase 
                    service (excluding credit card numbers) is shared with the 
                    merchant from whom the cardholder is purchasing the products 
                    / services so the merchant can fulfill the order. Information 
                    is also shared with other parties necessary to complete credit 
                    card transactions, including, without limitation, companies 
                    related to BBServers, credit card companies, credit card 
                    clearing houses and processors, and financial institutions. 
                    </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:11;">BBServers is acting as an 
                    intermediary between the merchant and a user’s credit 
                    card company. The parties mentioned in the above paragraph, 
                    and not BBServers, are responsible for their own privacy 
                    polices and for maintaining privacy and confidentiality for 
                    all information BBServers provides them. If a user has 
                    any questions or concerns about the privacy policies of those 
                    parties, it must contact such parties. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:11;">Except for the above parties, 
                    and for use by BBServers’s consultants and professional 
                    advisers on BBServers’s behalf for the uses disclosed 
                    herein, BBServers does not share personal information 
                    with any other third parties. BBServers may, however, 
                    provide to third parties aggregate or statistical information 
                    that does not disclose personally identifiable information. 
                    BBServers may disclose personal information to another 
                    entity purchasing (including for diligence purposes prior 
                    to purchase) the assets of BBServers, providing that 
                    entity abides by this or a similar privacy policy. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:11;"><b>Contact Us / Email Inquiries: 
                    <br>
                    </b>No information sent to BBServers via email or the 
                    website inquiry form is used for any other reason than to 
                    respond to and maintain a record of the inquiry. This information

                    </b>BBServers takes measures to protect and keep information 
                    secure. Our Merchants’ area, application form and electronic 
                    purchase service are secured with SSL encryption. Verisign 
                    has supplied us with digital certificates for our Web sites. 
                    All information collected by BBServers is held offline, 
                    secured via SSL encryption, and protected by a firewall. Whenever 
                    sensitive information is transmitted to BBServers through 
                    our Web site, such as a credit card number, our server provides 
                    128-bit encryption of the information as it travels across 
                    the Internet. BBServers restricts internal access to 
                    personal information to selected members of BBServers’s 
                    staff. </span></p>
