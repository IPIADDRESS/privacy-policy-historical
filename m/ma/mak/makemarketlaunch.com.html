We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future experiences for you, improving our operations, and communicating with you.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Information Collected Automatically<br>
    </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many web sites, we use “cookies” and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our Website or advertisements and other content served by us or on our behalf on other web sites. We may also automatically collect your Internet Protocol and referring web site addresses, browser type and domain name. &nbsp;This information helps facilitate your online experience on our Website. &nbsp;We use “cookies” to track usage patterns on our Website and to control the display of ads, as well as to offer other functionalities. &nbsp;You can turn off cookies, but that will affect your online experience. &nbsp;Please see below for more detail on cookies.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We use collected information to evaluate and administer our Website, fulfill your requests, respond to any future problems, such as difficulties in navigating our Website or accessing certain features, and to gauge user trends.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> As in any transaction, when you purchase products or make a donation by credit card, your credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, date, total cost and other information necessary to process the transaction. &nbsp;We will not otherwise provide any personal data to your credit card company without your permission. &nbsp;We and our technical and fulfillment agents, partners and consultants follow carefully proscribed procedures to safeguard credit card data in connection with your transactions and adhere to certain legal requirements. </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
