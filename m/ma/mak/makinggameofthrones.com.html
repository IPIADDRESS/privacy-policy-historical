(“HBO”) offering.  Thank you for your interest in our content.  Your privacy is important to us, and the purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to outline for you what information we collect, how we use it, and where and how we share it.  Please read this Privacy Policy before using our Service.</p>\r\n  <p>2. <b>Relevant Definitions:</b></p>\r\n  <p>When you are reviewing this Policy, we use a couple of common definitions to make it easier to read. These are:</p>\r\n  <p>Affiliates = A list of related companies to HBO.   As of the Effective Date (identified below) of the Policy, Affiliates include our HBO international businesses, AT&amp;T, INC.; WARNER MEDIA, LLC; Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc., and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. along with their respective affiliated companies.   This list may change from time to time and we will update this Policy accordingly.</p>\r\n  <p>Service = all of our consumer-facing HBO websites, services and applications, as well as all of their features, downloads and components, including offline customer service and support features, but excluding European Economic Area (EEA)-based OTT applications (such as HBO GO and HBO NOW applications designated for residents of EEA countries) that have a separate privacy notice. Details about the policy applicable to these services can be found during sign-up for the service and/or on the website for such service. </p>\r\n  <p>3. <b>What is the Effective Date?</b></p>\r\n  <p>The Effective Date of this Policy is November 7, 2018.  You can see a copy of the previous policy <a href=\&quot;privacy-policy-previous\&quot; >here</a></p>\r\n  <p>4.&nbsp;<b>Has the Policy changed from the previous version?</b></p>\r\n  <p>We have updated our Policy to make it more user-friendly and to add a section applicable to the EEA to reflect updates to European data privacy laws, as some of our Services are accessible in that region. We have also updated our list of Affiliates (see Paragraph 2, above).</p>\r\n  <p>5.&nbsp;<b>How will I know about any future changes or updates to the Policy?</b></p>\r\n  <p>HBO can modify the Policy in the future.  Changes to the Policy will be communicated to you by making the new and previous Policy available on the Service for review a reasonable period before the change is effective.  If we make changes to the Policy that materially change the way we use your previously-collected personal information, we will communicate with you either via e-mail or a prominent posting on the Service.</p>\r\n  <p>6.&nbsp;<b>Does the Policy apply to me?</b></p>\r\n  <p>This Policy applies to any user of the Service, including your family members or other users under your account. Please make any friends or other users aware of this Policy before you provide their personal information.   Please make sure that everyone understands this Policy before using the Service.</p>\r\n  <p>If you are a business customer of HBO, you can access a copy of our business-to-business privacy notice <a href=\&quot;http://www.homeboxoffice.com/\&quot; >here</a>.</p>\r\n  <p>This Policy also contains certain additional information that is relevant only where the collection and use of information by HBO is subject to European data protection and data privacy laws. This section only applies to individuals who are accessing the Service from within the EEA. If you are accessing the Service from the EEA, please see <a href=\&quot;#section-v\&quot;>Section V</a> for a description of your data protection rights, including a right to object to some of the processing we carry out.</p>\r\n  <a name=\&quot;section-i\&quot;></a>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  <h2>I. HBO Privacy Policy – The Information We Collect</h2>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p><b>What information do you collect about me?</b></p>\r\n  <p>We collect different types of information from you depending upon the Service you access, our relationship with you and your preferences:</p>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p><b>A. ACCOUNT INFORMATION</b></p>\r\n  <p>Below is a list of account information we collect. Some account information will only be collected about users of our digital streaming and content viewing services (e.g. HBO GO and HBO NOW), which are restricted to U.S. residents and so will not apply to other users of the Services.

We collect information about your use of these controls.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;left-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p><b>Registered Account*: </b></p>\r\n    <p>*U.S. only</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;right-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p>When you create an account with our Service, we collect your name and e-mail address.

We also collect information about your actions on the Service (including your profiles, settings, watch lists and search terms).</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;left-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p><b>Video Viewing Information:</b></p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;right-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p>We collect information about the films, TV shows and URLs that you view through the Service.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p><b>B. MARKETING &amp;amp; RESEARCH INFORMATION</b></p>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;left-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p><b>Communication with you:</b></p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;right-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p>When you create an HBO GO or HBO NOW account in the U.S., you automatically agree to opt in to receive marketing e-mail from HBO and our Affiliates about HBO and/or the Service, offers of other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you and information in connection with incentive programs, rewards and fan engagement activities.</p>\r\n    <p>Other portions of the Service, such as promotional sites and apps, may offer you the opportunity to opt in to marketing messages and newsletters by providing your email address.  You will also receive marketing from our Affiliates where you have provided this information. We collect and store information in response to marketing to you, including bounce backs, clicks, and information about whether our messages are opened.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;left-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p><b>Promotions on the Service:</b></p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;right-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p>When you enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotional activity offered on the Service, we collect your e-mail address, name and/or address.  When you enter, we may also ask you to consent to receiving e-mail communication from HBO and our Affiliates.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;left-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p><b>Referrals/Incentives:</b></p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;right-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p>If a “friend” feature is activated, you may have the opportunity to participate and earn incentives by providing your friend’s contact information (name, e-mail address), importing your contact lists from other sites or devices, or sending links to your friends. You may not provide contact information for any friends without their consent. We may require verification of consent before allowing your friend(s) to access these features.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;left-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p><b>Social Media Profiles &amp;amp; Bots:</b></p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;right-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p>If you engage with the Service through third party social media plug-ins and applications (such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram) we may ask you to allow us to have ongoing access to information from your social media account (such as name, e-mail address and profile photo).  We may also access information about HBO or our Service(s) that you have published publically from various online platforms, such as through Twitter hashtags or Instagram handles. Please refer to the privacy policies of those social media networks to understand your choices with regards to their services.</p>\r\n    <p>If you use functionality on the Service to “share” or “like” content with a social media site, that content will be visible to the social media site and any individuals you have given access to your profile via your settings on that site.</p>\r\n    <p>We may provide access to chatbots through third party services.  Chatbots are computer programs that simulate conversation with you, sometimes in the voice of a fictional character, for example.   When you interact with a chatbot, we receive information about those interactions.   Communications you have with chatbots are not private.   Please think carefully about incorporating any personal or private information into these interactions.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;left-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p><b>Surveys:</b></p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;right-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p>We receive the information you provide when you answer a survey or participate in research.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p><b>C.

This information might be about you, your preferences, or your device, and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to. The information does not usually directly identify you, but it can give you a more personalized web experience.</p>\r\n    <p>You can choose to accept or decline some types of cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.   In many cases, declining cookies may limit the effectiveness of the functionality of the Service.</p>\r\n    <p>We use the following categories of cookies on the Service:</p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p><b>Category 1 – Strictly necessary cookies: </b>Essential in order to enable you to move around the Service and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for (such as remembering your login details or where you paused a piece of content) cannot be provided. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Service may no longer work.</p></li>\r\n      <li><p><b>Category 2 – Performance cookies: </b>Collect information about how you use the Service, like which pages you go to most often, and if you get error messages from web pages.  Information these cookies collect is aggregated, and help us to measure and improve the performance of the Service.</p></li>\r\n      <li><p><b>Category 3 – Functionality cookies: </b>Allow the Service to remember choices you make (such as your user name, font, text size or language) and provide enhanced functionality and more personal features. The information these cookies collect cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function well.</p></li>\r\n      <li><p><b>Category 4 – Targeting Cookies: </b>Usually placed by third party advertising network partners.   They collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising on other sites more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an ad as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.  If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</p></li>\r\n      <li><p><b>Category 5 – Social media cookies: </b>These cookies allow you to share what you’ve been doing on the Service on social media such as Facebook and Twitter. These cookies are not within our control.  Please refer to the privacy policies of the social networks in question for how their cookies work.</p></li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;left-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p><b>Web Beacons and Other Technologies:</b></p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\&quot;right-column\&quot;>\r\n    <p>Web beacons are small strings of code (also called clear gifs or pixel tags) that work similarly to cookies.  We use them for many of the same purposes, including to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count views and emails that were opened.</p>\r\n    <p>We use other technologies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g. HTML5) for the same purposes as cookies and web beacons.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p><b>D.

As you use the Service, third parties may place cookies and collect personal information concerning your online activities over time and across different websites.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <a name=\&quot;section-ii\&quot;></a>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  <h2>II.

  <h1>HBO Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>Overview and Summary</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>1.&nbsp;<b>What is the Privacy Policy?</b></p>
  <p>Hello and welcome to a Home Box Office, Inc. (“HBO”) offering.  Thank you for your interest in our content.  Your privacy is important to us, and the purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to outline for you what information we collect, how we use it, and where and how we share it.  Please read this Privacy Policy before using our Service.</p>
  <p>2. <b>Relevant Definitions:</b></p>
  <p>When you are reviewing this Policy, we use a couple of common definitions to make it easier to read. These are:</p>
  <p>Affiliates = A list of related companies to HBO.   As of the Effective Date (identified below) of the Policy, Affiliates include our HBO international businesses, AT&amp;T, INC.; WARNER MEDIA, LLC; Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc., and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. along with their respective affiliated companies.   This list may change from time to time and we will update this Policy accordingly.</p>
  <p>Service = all of our consumer-facing HBO websites, services and applications, as well as all of their features, downloads and components, including offline customer service and support features, but excluding European Economic Area (EEA)-based OTT applications (such as HBO GO and HBO NOW applications designated for residents of EEA countries) that have a separate privacy notice. Details about the policy applicable to these services can be found during sign-up for the service and/or on the website for such service. </p>
  <p>3. <b>What is the Effective Date?</b></p>
  <p>The Effective Date of this Policy is November 7, 2018.  You can see a copy of the previous policy <a href="privacy-policy-previous">here</a></p>
  <p>4.&nbsp;<b>Has the Policy changed from the previous version?</b></p>
  <p>We have updated our Policy to make it more user-friendly and to add a section applicable to the EEA to reflect updates to European data privacy laws, as some of our Services are accessible in that region. We have also updated our list of Affiliates (see Paragraph 2, above).</p>
  <p>5.&nbsp;<b>How will I know about any future changes or updates to the Policy?</b></p>
  <p>HBO can modify the Policy in the future.  Changes to the Policy will be communicated to you by making the new and previous Policy available on the Service for review a reasonable period before the change is effective.  If we make changes to the Policy that materially change the way we use your previously-collected personal information, we will communicate with you either via e-mail or a prominent posting on the Service.</p>
  <p>6.&nbsp;<b>Does the Policy apply to me?</b></p>
  <p>This Policy applies to any user of the Service, including your family members or other users under your account. Please make any friends or other users aware of this Policy before you provide their personal information.   Please make sure that everyone understands this Policy before using the Service.</p>
  <p>If you are a business customer of HBO, you can access a copy of our business-to-business privacy notice <a href="http://www.homeboxoffice.com/">here</a>.</p>
  <p>This Policy also contains certain additional information that is relevant only where the collection and use of information by HBO is subject to European data protection and data privacy laws. This section only applies to individuals who are accessing the Service from within the EEA. If you are accessing the Service from the EEA, please see <a href="#section-v">Section V</a> for a description of your data protection rights, including a right to object to some of the processing we carry out.</p>

In many cases, declining cookies may limit the effectiveness of the functionality of the Service.</p>
    <p>We use the following categories of cookies on the Service:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><b>Category 1 – Strictly necessary cookies: </b>Essential in order to enable you to move around the Service and use its features.

      <li><p><b>Category 4 – Targeting Cookies: </b>Usually placed by third party advertising network partners.   They collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising on other sites more relevant to you and your interests.
