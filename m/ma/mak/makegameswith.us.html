<p>Welcome to makeschool.com, the online and mobile service of makegameswithus, Inc. DBA Make School ("Company," "we," or "us"). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>

<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="https://www.makeschool.com/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<h3>We collect the following types of information about you:</h3>

<h5>Information you provide us directly:</h5>

<p>We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, and e-mail address when you register for a Company account, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>

<h3>Information we may receive from third parties:</h3>

For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by "following," "liking," adding the Company application, linking your account to the Company Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Company. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join Company. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Company Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.</p>
