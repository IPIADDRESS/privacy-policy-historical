<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Welcome to makeschool.com, the online and mobile service of makegameswithus, Inc. DBA Make School ("Company," "we," or "us"). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>

<h2>1. How we collect your information</h2>
<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="https://www.makeschool.com/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a><br>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>

<h4>Information you provide us directly:</h4>

<p>We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, and e-mail address when you register for a Company account, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>

<h4>Information we may receive from third parties:</h4>
<p>We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by "following," "liking," adding the Company application, linking your account to the Company Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Company. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friendsâ€™ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join Company. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Company Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.</p>

<h4>Analytics information.</h4>
<p>We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>

Company may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Company or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Keeping your information safe:</h3>

You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Company, at all times. However, Company cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Company or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
