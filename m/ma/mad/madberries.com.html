		<h4>Rough Roses Whitney Tote</h4>
		<div><strong>A Sharp Whitney</strong></div>
		<div>No wonder celebs have been snatching up Rough Roses Whitney Tote —it’s tremendous both in size and style.  An overabundance of leather creates a slouchy, gathered shape in an oversized square tote, while customized rose studs reinforce the tough beauty of the lucky carrier. We see Whitney as a laid-back luxurati with a keen eye for cute and plenty to do in the meantime … this bag is her badge of honor.
