            <p>  If you have any questions about the security at our Web Sites, please contact  us at <a href="mailto:privacy@madisonlogic.com">privacy@madisonlogic.com</a>. </p>
           <h3>Exceptions </h3>
            <p>  Other than as set forth above,  Madison Logic will not otherwise use or disclose any of your personal  information except to the extent reasonably necessary to: (i) process your  information and to correct technical problems and malfunctions in the Website  or the computer systems supporting the Website; (ii) protect the security and  integrity of the Website; (iii) protect the rights and property of Madison  Logic and others; (iv) take precautions against liability; (v) respond to  claims that your information violates the rights and interests of third-parties;  (vi) respond to judicial or administrative process or otherwise comply with  applicable law; and (vii) to assist law enforcement agencies in connection with  investigations or matters related to public safety. </p>
           <h3>Updating  Personal Information </h3>

          <h3>Links  to Other Web Sites </h3>
            <p>Findwhitepapers.com, eMarketingPapers.com,  and Investbrite.com are three of the properties within the Madison Logic  network of sites. Each of these sites hosts thousands of white papers as well  as white paper Research Libraries on third party sites. Some Third Party  Content made available through the Research Library sites is maintained on the  website of the Content Provider, and not on the Madison Logic network of sites.  This means that when you click through to that Third Party Content, you will be  leaving the Research Library and the Madison Logic Network. It will be clear to  you when this happens, as the look and feel of your web page will change, and  the URL will no longer refer to a website in Madison Logic network of sites.  This Privacy Policy does not govern the use and disclosure of any information  you choose to disclose to the Content Provider on the Content Provider site.</p>
            <p>In addition, the  Sites you are viewing may be co-branded, meaning that the Sites are branded  with the logos of both Madison Logic and a third party (“Co-Branded Sites”). If  you register or log in on a Co-Branded Site, you are choosing to disclose  information to both Madison Logic and the third party with whose brand the site  is co-branded. This Privacy Policy only governs Madison Logic’s use of your information.  The third party’s use of that personal information is governed by the partner's  privacy policy, and not by this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>The Madison Logic Web Site also contains  links to other Web Sites. Please be aware that Madison Logic is not responsible  for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to read  the privacy statements of each and every Web Site that you visit from our Web  Site or through the interactive sessions. </p>
