MadSci Network is a non-profit organization devoted to promoting
science literacy and encouraging an interest in science, both
at the K-12 level, and in the general population. All pages within
MadSci Network will have madsci.org or its IP address 
as the server address, and no tilde (~) in the
path of the URL. Paths containing a tilde refer to home pages
of some scientists participating in the administration of the site. 
<p>
When visiting MadSci Network we may record information regarding
the materials accessed. This information is not sold nor shared with
third parties, or make publically available, unless you enter specific
information on our <a href="#aska">ask-a-question form</a> (see below). 
</p><p>
All hits to and internal processes on madsci.org generate the following information in our server logs:
</p><ul>
	<li> The Internet address, or IP# of your machine's Internet connection. Examples
	include proxy-49.aol.com or 123.243.45.168.

</li></ul>

We use this information in the following manner:
<ul>
	<li> Generate <a href="/stats/">monthly statistics</a> regarding 
	traffic and usage, which may be included in proposals to obtain
	funding for MadSci Network so we may keep it a free service.
	</li><li> Identify mistakes in files or trouble-shoot errors.
	</li><li> Identify high-usage materials that may be developed further to
	provide additional, useful information.

	and answer questions in high volume categories.
	</li><li> Make certain our materials and interfaces are accessible to
	the platforms and browsers used by visitors.

	</li><li> In addition, we may opt to supply this information to a user's 
	identified Internet Service Provider concerning any user who 
	abuses or attempts to interfere with the functioning of our site.
	</li><li> Beyond these points, MadSci does not disclose, give, sell, or 
	transfer personal information concerning visitors to our
	website unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required
	by law.
</li></ul>
In addition, many pages on our site link to 
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google's
web search</a> for non-profit organizations. 
These search results are delivered by the site google.com, and will
redirect you to content on madsci.org unless you select the option

MadSci Network participates in the <a href="http://www.vrd.org/">Virtual
Reference Desk</a> (VRD), an organization of volunteer librarians who
assist Internet patrons. MadSci forwards occasional questions
to the VRD, particularly those asking about where to find information,
how to use a library, or covering non-science topics.
The information you provide on our <a href="/ask.html">question form</a>
will be forwarded to the VRD.
<p>
Information submitted on the ask-a-question form may be used in the following
manner(s):
	</p><ul>
	<li> Track the number of questions submitted in individual subjects. This
	information helps us determine when we need to recruit additional
	scientists to field questions, or whether specific subjects should be
	added or removed from our existing list. 

	</li><li> Perform scientific research and analyses regarding the educational level
	of students submitting questions, and types of questions received.
	</li><li> Identify commonly asked questions, and create Frequently-Asked-Question
	files (FAQs) to address them.
	</li><li> We will also use this information to trouble-shoot errors or problems in
	our interfaces.
	</li><li> In addition, we may opt to supply this information to a user's identified 
	Internet Service Provider concerning any user who abuses our interfaces 
	or who submits materials that are rude, obnoxious, that contain expletives, 
	or threats of any sort.
        </li><li> Beyond these points, MadSci does not disclose, give, sell, or
        transfer personal information concerning visitors to our
        website unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required
        by law.
