The categories of information we collect, including in the last 12 months, include the following: contact data, including your first and last name, telephone number, email address, and postal address; billing information; credentials, including your passwords; content data, including the content of the messages you send to us; IP addresses or IP ranges you submit; and resume data, including data necessary to consider you for a job opening (such as your employment history, writing samples, and references). We also use payment processes to collect and process payment data, including your payment instrument and security code associated with your payment instrument, on our behalf.</p>

<p>You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Services that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.</p>

<h2>Information Collected Automatically</h2>

<p>We automatically collect information about your device and how your device interacts with our Services and other services. The categories of information we automatically collect, including in the last 12 months, and the methods by which we may collect such information include the following:</p>

<h3>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Embedded Scripts</h3>

<p>The Services use "cookies" and similar technologies, including HTML5 local storage. A cookie is a file stored on your device that may be used to identify an individual as a unique user by storing certain personal preferences and user data. MaxMind uses cookies and other technologies to identify your device, identify authorized users of the MaxMind Account Portal, track affiliate referrals, complete online purchases through MaxMind's shopping carts, and similar Services monitoring activities.</p>

<p>MaxMind may also use web beacons, small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs"), which may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>

<p>MaxMind may also use embedded scripts in connection with the provision of its Services. "Embedded scripts" are programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with a website, such as the links you click on, and may assist our customers in providing us with information used to provide the Services. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server, our customer's web server, or a service provider or other party, is active only while you are connected to the website containing the embedded script, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>

<h3>Log File Information</h3>

<p>Your web browser automatically sends information to every website you visit, including ours. For example, our server logs may receive and record information such as the pages you access on the Services, referring URLs, your browser type, your operating system, the date and time of your visit, and the duration of your visit to each page.</p>

<h3>User Agent Strings</h3>

<p>Log file information may also include a user agent string, a series of characters automatically sent with your Internet requests that provide information necessary for smooth Internet communications, such as the operating system and browser you used. A user agent string might be used to identify the device originating a message.</p>

<h3>Location Data</h3>

<p>MaxMind may also request access to or otherwise receive information about your device location when you access the Services. Your location data may be based on your IP address and other location-aware technologies. We use location data in connection with providing the Services and to help improve the Services.</p>

<h3>Unique Identification Number</h3>

<p>MaxMind may assign your computer or mobile device a unique identification number ("Unique ID") based on log file information when you access the Services. MaxMind may set a cookie on your device containing, amongst other things, the device's Unique ID. MaxMind uses information generated from the Unique ID for purposes of improving our Services, primarily our ability to detect fraud. MaxMind does not share the Unique ID or any associated data with unaffiliated parties in the traditional sense of sharing. However, some of the services offered by MaxMind, including some that are available through the Services, may require the placement of a snippet of JavaScript on the customer's own website (either by the customer itself or by MaxMind), and that JavaScript collects the information used by MaxMind to create the Unique ID. If the customer uses the MaxMind minFraud service, it may receive back the Unique ID MaxMind associated with the IP address being used in the request made to the minFraud service.</p>

<h2>Information MaxMind Receives from Other Sources</h2>

<p>MaxMind receives information about you from other sources. We may combine the information we receive from third parties with information we collect through the Services. If we do so, MaxMind will treat the combined information in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. The categories of other sources from which we receive and have received information over the prior 12 months include: our business partners and resellers; our customers; and publicly available sources such as open government databases or other data in the public domain. For example, our customers provide us with certain e-commerce transaction information, including IP address, cardholder name, billing and shipping address, email, and phone number.</p>

<h1 id="how-maxmind-uses-information">3. HOW MAXMIND USES INFORMATION</h1>

<p>We collect and use information for our legitimate interests and for business and commercial purposes in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Our business purposes for collecting and using information, including in the prior 12 months, include as follows:</p>

<h2>Providing Our Services</h2>

<p>As stated above, MaxMind uses information such as your first and last name, telephone number, email address, postal address, billing information, or other contact information we obtain from you, our customers, or our business partners, for the purposes of providing, enhancing, or improving our IP geolocation, fraud detection, demographic targeting, databases, and other services and products.</p>

<h2>Communications with You</h2>

<p>MaxMind maintains one or more contact lists (with email addresses and other information) to allow MaxMind to communicate with individuals who do business with MaxMind or who have expressed an interest in the Services. We may contact you to confirm your purchases or respond to requests that you make, notify you of changes to your account or the Services, for marketing purposes, or to otherwise inform you of information related to our business or your account with us.</p>

<h2>Website Administration and Customization</h2>

<p>MaxMind uses the information we collect about you for a variety of website administration and customization purposes. For example, we use your information to process your registration request, provide you with services and communications that you have requested, send you email updates and other communications, customize features and advertising that appear on and off the Services, deliver the Services content to you, measure Services traffic, measure user interests and traffic patterns, and improve the Services.</p>

<h2>Usage of IP Addresses</h2>

<p>The MaxMind services, including the minFraud service, use IP addresses to help organizations detect and prevent fraudulent activity. Among other things, MaxMind obtains IP addresses and order information (including customer name and billing address) through its minFraud service. MaxMind uses the billing location from this data along with other data to create databases that pair IP addresses with the locations in which they are likely being used, down to a postal code level of resolution.</p>

<h2>Correction Requests</h2>

<p>If you receive IP geolocation data from us that you believe is incorrect, you can submit a data correction request to us through our website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.maxmind.com/geoip-data-correction-request/">https://support.maxmind.com/geoip-data-correction-request/</a>, by email at <a href="mailto:corrections@maxmind.com">corrections@maxmind.com</a>, or through a secure URL that is set up by your company and that shares IP geolocation data. We use the information you submit to review and respond to your correction request, and update our databases as appropriate. Any data updated within our databases may be used and shared in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Database Demos</h2>

<p>If you use any of our database demos available at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo">https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/locate-my-ip-address">https://www.maxmind.com/en/locate-my-ip-address</a>, and other parts of our website, we may use the information you submit to provide you with results and update our databases as appropriate. Any data updated within our databases may be used and shared in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Consent</h2>

<p>We also use information with your consent, including for the following purposes: to allow you to participate in our surveys; to serve advertising tailored to your interests on our Services and other services; and to fulfill any other purpose disclosed to you and with your consent.</p>

<p>Some of our lawful bases for processing your information stem from our customers on whose behalf we provide services.</p>

<p>MaxMind uses information that does not identify you for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law. For information on your rights and choices regarding how we use your information, please see Section 6 below.</p>

<h1 id="how-maxmind-shares-information">4. HOW MAXMIND SHARES INFORMATION</h1>

<p>We share information we collect in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. The categories of sources to whom we share information, including in the last 12 months, include the following:</p>

<h2>Sharing with Our Service Providers</h2>

<p>We provide your information to our service providers, contractors, business partners, and advertisers, for the purpose of delivering services to you as well as for purposes related to Services administration and operation, including conducting analytics and helping us with sales tax compliance. When sharing information for the purpose of providing you with the services you request, we will share your information only as necessary for the service provider working on MaxMind's behalf to complete its work for us. For example, if you use a credit or debit card to complete a transaction on the Services, we will share your credit or debit card number with a payment processing and/or a fulfillment company in order to complete your transaction.</p>

<h2>Sharing of Databases</h2>

<p>One aspect of MaxMind's products and services is the provision of databases to our customers and other third parties, including our business partners and resellers. These databases include information such as IP addresses and corresponding data pertaining to such IP addresses, such as geolocation data, fraud analysis data, and related information. Such databases are compiled using numerous data sources, including information we receive from our customers when individuals make purchases or conduct other transactions with our customers. In addition, we respond to API queries from our customers, and such responses may include information about the level of risk we associate with information about your device or email address, or your Unique ID.</p>

<h2>Customers</h2>

<p>We share your information with our customers in connection with us processing your information on their behalf. For example, we share your information with our customers to provide them with our products and services, respond to your questions and comments, fulfill your requests, and otherwise comply with applicable law.</p>

<h2>Vendors and Other Parties</h2>

<p>We may share your information with vendors and other parties for purposes of providing you with tailored advertisements, measuring and improving our Service and advertising effectiveness, and enabling other enhancements. Vendors may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information.</p>

<p>MaxMind integrates with the service Have I Been Pwned to verify whether your account password has previously appeared in a third party data breach, which may allow MaxMind to evaluate the strength of the password, provide a warning, and/or block the password outright. We are not responsible for the effectiveness or accuracy of their information.

<h2>Security and Compliance with the Law</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your information to appropriate third parties if we are required to do so by law or we believe that such action is necessary in order (a) to comply with a legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order; (b) to protect the company's rights and property; (c) to investigate reports of users sending material using a false email address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages; (d) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Website or Services; or (e) to respond to emergencies, such as when we believe someone's physical safety is at risk. MaxMind may be required to disclose information in a life-threatening emergency or in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

<h2>Transfer of Business</h2>

<p>Over time, MaxMind may buy or sell various assets. In the event that we sell some or all of our assets, or our company is acquired by another company, or during the negotiation of such sale or acquisition, our databases and any information we collect may be among the transferred or negotiated assets.</p>

<h2>Consent</h2>

<p>We may share your information for any other purpose disclosed to you and with your consent.</p>

<p>Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, MaxMind shares information that does not identify you with third parties, including our customers, for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law. For information on your rights and choices regarding how we share your information, please see Section 6 below.</p>

<h1 id="analytics-and-only-tracking">5. ANALYTICS AND ONLINE TRACKING</h1>

<p>MaxMind works with certain other parties (including analytics companies) to provide us with information regarding traffic on and use of the Services. Some of these parties collect information when you visit the Services or other online websites and services. These other parties set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, embedded scripts, and web beacons) and may otherwise collect or have access to your IP address or other unique identifier, log information, and related information about you. These tracking technologies, including the Google Analytics User ID feature, may be used to assist in providing analytics, marketing, and for other purposes. We also use Google services to provide you with in-site search functionality. Both we and Google may collect, receive, and use your information as a consequence of your use of the Google services. Google’s data practices are set out in its privacy policy available at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>. MaxMind does not control the information collection, use, or sharing practices of such parties, and we encourage you to consult their online policies.

<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to websites and online services you visit; however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context.

<h1 id="additional-disclosures-for-nevada-residents">13. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS</h1>

<p>Nevada law requires certain businesses to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer from whom MaxMind has collected personal information and you wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us as at <a href="mailto:nevada-privacy@maxmind.com">nevada-privacy@maxmind.com</a>.</p>

<h1 id="additional-disclosures-for-data-subjects-in-europe">14. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR DATA SUBJECTS IN EUROPE</h1>

<h2>Roles</h2>

<p>EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as "controllers") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "processors").</p>

<p>MaxMind, located at the address set forth in Section 11 above, generally operates as a processor on behalf of its customers that use the MaxMind's services. The MaxMind customer, the controller, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. Specifically, MaxMind's customer decides what personal data to share with MaxMind in order for MaxMind to provide the customer with robust risk score information, certain licensed data, the ability to flag potentially fraudulent activity, and other services as purchased by the customer. Please visit the applicable customer's privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.</p>

<p>MaxMind also operates as a controller with respect to certain of its services and/or databases. For example, MaxMind operates as a controller in connection with personal data collected from visitors through its website, including through data correction requests. Also, when MaxMind combines personal data from different customers, like many kinds of analytics services, it may do this both as a processor at its customers' instruction and as a controller itself for the purpose of providing services to all of its customers. For example, MaxMind may process and aggregate or otherwise de-identify some of the personal data that a customer shares with MaxMind in order to make that personal data part of another database for one or more other services provided to MaxMind customers.</p>

<h2>Data Subject Rights</h2>

<p>If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Services. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Services. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.</p>

<p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the information at Section 11 above and specify which right you intend to exercise. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>If your information has been processed by us on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to exercise any rights you have with such information, please inquire with our customer directly. If you wish to make your request directly to MaxMind, please provide the name of the MaxMind customer on whose behalf MaxMind processes your information. We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request.</p>
