                              <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") discloses the data collection and use practices 
                                of MaxPreps ("MaxPreps") in connection with the MaxPreps website, www.MaxPreps.com 
                                (the "Web Site") and all associated MaxPreps products and services (the "MaxPreps 
                                Services").</p>
                              <p><b>What Information We Collect/How We Use It</b><br>
                                We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of 
                                this Policy. Our registration form (or registration information you provide 
                                our marketing partners if you joined MaxPreps though one of our partners) requests 
                                that you provide certain contact and profile information (like your name, e-mail 
                                address, and zip code). Some of the requested information is required in order 
                                to receive MaxPreps Services; other information is optional. The required information 
                                is indicated as such on the registration pages of the MaxPreps Web Site. Depending 
                                on the specific MaxPreps Services for which a user registers, certain category 
                                specific information will be requested. We use this additional data to personalize 
                                your MaxPreps experience. By obtaining and using this information, we can provide 
                                you with the most timely, relevant and individualized service according to your 
                                preferences and interests.<br>
                                Other than the information we require in order to provide one or more MaxPreps 
                                Services to you, you do not have to provide any further information. But your 
                                election to withhold certain information will limit the value of the MaxPreps 
                                experience for you. The more information we have about you, the more valuable 
                                the MaxPreps experience will be for you.<br>
                                In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and 
                                add it to your MaxPreps membership information. We do this to improve personalization 
                                of our services (for example, providing better regional content, advertising 
                                or special offers that we think will interest you). <br>
                                We also may collect information such as the identification of the server your 
                                computer is logged onto and whether you opened a MaxPreps e-mail delivered to 
                                you. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, 
                                in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. You can add 
                                and modify certain parts of the information you have provided by following the 
                                instructions set forth below. (See change status)</p>
                              <p>We use all this information in five ways: <br>
                                1) to provide you with personalized information via electronic delivery and/or 
                                direct mail; <br>
                                2) to send you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; 
                                <br>
                                3) to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct 
                                mail; <br>
                                4) to send you general and administrative information about your MaxPreps membership 
                                via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and <br>
                                5) to provide your contact information to MaxPreps marketing partners whose 
                                offer(s) you have selected to receive in order for them to send you special 
                                offers via electronic delivery, telemarketing and direct mail. </p>
                              <p>We do not send or support the delivery of unsolicited bulk e-mail (a.k.a. "spam"). 
                              </p>
                              <p><b>Agents</b><br>
                                We may employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on 
                                our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate 
                                information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis. 
                                These agents have access to member personal information as needed to perform 
                                their functions for MaxPreps, but we do not permit them to use it for other 
                                purposes. </p>
                              <p><b>Cookies</b><br>
                                We use cookies to, among other things, save your password so you don't have 
                                to re-enter it each time you visit the MaxPreps Web Site and to deliver personalized 
                                content. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may 
                                change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie 
                                is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting 
                                cookies while visiting the MaxPreps Web Site may result in certain parts of 
                                the MaxPreps Web Site not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were 
                                allowed. For example, if you are a MaxPreps member, you may need to enter your 
                                username and password each time you visit the MaxPreps Web Site. <br>
                                We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These 
                                companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs 
                                or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these 
                                third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. </p>
                              <p><b>E-mail Links</b><br>
                                In some instances we may include certain links in our e-mails that will allow 
                                us to monitor whether you access specific content or advertisements contained 
                                in that e-mail. When you click on one of these links, we will record that click 
                                and certain activities on the Web page associated with that link. We may use 
                                this information for various purposes, such as to conduct internal research 
                                on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior in and to our e-mail advertisements 
                                and content, and to better understand and serve you. </p>
                              <p><b>Disclosures </b><br>
                                MaxPreps may disclose information about you and your use of the MaxPreps Web 
                                Site and the MaxPreps Services if MaxPreps believes such disclosure is reasonably 
                                necessary: (i) to comply with the law or legal process; (ii) to protect or defend 
                                the rights or property of MaxPreps or others; (iii) to enforce the MaxPreps 
                                Terms and Conditions or this Privacy Policy; and (iv) to respond to claims that 
                                the content(s) of a communication violates the rights of another. In addition 
                                MaxPreps may share or transfer information about you and that you provide to 
                                MaxPreps, to one or more third party entities pursuant to a sale, merger, assignment, 
                                joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion, or all of, the 
                                assets or stock of MaxPreps or its affiliated entities, or as otherwise provided 
                                herein. </p>
                              <p><b>Security </b><br>
                                The MaxPreps Web Site has security measures in place intended to protect the 
                                loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our hardware 
                                infrastructure is housed in a controlled access facility that restricts access 
                                to authorized individuals with positive identification. Our network access to 
                                the infrastructure is protected by a firewall protection system. Member information 
                                is backed up on a periodic basis to protect against accidental loss. However, 
                                we can not guarantee that communications between you and MaxPreps will not be 
                                intercepted by others and that information stored on our servers will be free 
                                from unauthorized access. While we have taken reasonable precautions to protect 
                                this information, you should always use discretion in what information you send 
                                to us and not expect that such information will be absolutely free from intrusion. 
                              </p>
                              <p><b>Children</b><br>
                                MaxPreps is committed to the safety of children. Children under the age of 13 
                                may not register or participate in any of our services. If children under 18 
                                elect to register in the MaxPreps service, they should ask a parent for permission 
                                before sending any information to the site. We will not request or knowingly 
                                collect any Personally Identifiable Information from a child under 13. </p>
                              <p><b>Reports</b><br>
                                We periodically prepare analyses and reports reflecting visitor and member use 
                                of the MaxPreps Web Site and MaxPreps Service for our internal use as well as 
                                for a limited number of our business partners. These reports include aggregate 
                                (non-personal) information about MaxPreps members, and in certain instances, 
                                visitors to the MaxPreps Web Site. The information in these reports will not 
                                identify you individually. Our business partners who have access to these reports 
                                will not be able to contact you from the information contained in the reports. 
                              </p>
                              <p><b>Referral Program </b><br>
                                As part of our referral program, you can provide contact information (such as 
                                the name and e-mail address) of your friends and family whom you think would 
                                like to receive MaxPreps e-mails and use the MaxPreps Service. The users referred 
                                to us receive sample MaxPreps e-mails, but do not become members until they 
                                confirm their interest in the service. </p>

                                may ask you for additional information. We may also ask for information about 
                                referrals; see "Referral Program", above. We use and treat this information 
                                in accordance with the terms of this Policy. </p>
                              <p><b>Changing Your Status </b><br>
                                As a convenience to our members, we provide a number of different opportunities 
                                to review and change information in your profile and to unsubscribe from the 
                                MaxPreps Service entirely. For example, you can go to the MaxPreps Web Site 
                                and log into your profile page to make any desired changes. To have all of your 
                                personally identifiable information removed from our database, send an e-mail 
                                request to <a href="mailto:info@maxpreps.com">info@maxpreps.com</a> At the current time, we are not able to offer 
                                users the direct ability to delete their information from our database, but 
                                we will be happy to delete such information after we receive a request to that 
                                effect. Please be advised that by requesting that your data be removed from 
                                our database, you will be unsubscribed from the MaxPreps Service. </p>
                              <p><b>Updates </b><br>
                                MaxPreps may revise this Policy from time to time and at any time in the future

                                in MaxPreps data information gathering, storing and release practices, (iii) 
                                comply with applicable laws, and (iv) reflect changes in MaxPreps business structure. 
                                Depending on the nature of the change, we will notify users by e-mail (to the 
                                current e-mail address on file) and/or placing a notice on the MaxPreps Web
