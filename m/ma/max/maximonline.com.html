		PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE.
<br><br>
As used herein, the phrase “this site” refers to maximonline.com and other sites on the World Wide Web originating in the United States which are owned and/or operated by MaximNet, Inc. and Felix Dennis (collectively, Maxim). By using this site, you indicate your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, you are not permitted to access this site and you should not do so.
<br><br>
Maxim reserves the right to change or otherwise update this Policy at any time. Such changes or updates are effective immediately after Maxim gives notice of the change or update, which Maxim may do by posting on this site, or by electronic or conventional mail, and/or by any other means which provides reasonable notice. Your use of this site after such notice is posted means that you accept these changes or updates.
<br><br>
Maxim understands and respects your desire for privacy. To that end, we would like you to know how we use the personal information you provide to us.
<br><br>
We collect personally identifying information (such as your name and address) when you register for the online newsletter or Maxim Lounge, enter contests, or participate in other interactive online activities (e.g., surveys, chat rooms, games, or bulletin boards) throughout this site. As described below, we may use such information to award prizes or, with your permission, for promotional and marketing purposes. We also collect non-personally-identifiable information (such as your IP address or domain, or about your site usage) for purposes of site administration and to compile aggregate information about usage of the site.
<br><br>
You will be asked for your credit card information if you subscribe to Maxim Magazine or buy any other product from the site. Your credit card information is not collected or retained by Maxim. It, along with the personal identifying information you submit, is transferred to and used by third party financial institutions to verify the credit card numbers and to authorize the processing of the transaction. Be sure to review all privacy policies published by our third-party service providers and contact them directly if you have questions as they may have privacy terms that differ from Maxim’s Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
Maxim Online has implemented appropriate safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and to make proper use of the information that we collect. However, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal information, Maxim cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any information you provide to us. 
<br><br>
To unsubscribe from the Maxim Online newsletter and/or other electronic communications from Maxim, enter your e-mail address <a href="http://maximonline.com/newsletter/unsub.asp" target="new">right here.</a>  You may also reply to the e-mail newsletter with “UNSUBSCRIBE” (and only “UNSUBSCRIBE”) in the subject line, or by following the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the e-mail. You can also unsubscribe from promotional and marketing e-mails that you receive from a Maxim Online partner by typing “UNSUBSCRIBE” (and only “UNSUBSCRIBE”) in the subject line in a reply to one of the partner’s e-mails to you, or following the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the e-mail. 
<br><br>
To change the address of your Maxim Magazine subscription, or to provide any other subscription information to Maxim, you may write to Maxim, P.O. Box 420235, Palm Coast, FL 32142 or call 1-386-447-6312. 
<br><br>
If you have any questions or concerns about the Maxim Online Privacy Policy or its implementation, you may contact us at Maxim Online, Privacy Policy, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, 15th Fl., New York, NY 10018. 
<br><br>
POLICY FOR MINORS
<br><br>
Children should always ask parents for permission before providing any personal information online. No information should be submitted to or posted on this site by any Minor (a guest under 18 years of age) without the consent of a parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do not knowingly provide any personally identifying information about Minors, regardless of its source, to third parties, nor is this information knowingly used by Maxim for any marketing or promotional purposes. Minors are not allowed to participate in contests.
<br><br>
POLICY FOR ADULT GUESTS
<br><br>
Maxim Online collects personal information from guests over 18 years of age in order to provide guests with a personalized online experience and to provide our advertisers a way to reach the right audience. Maxim may share the personal and aggregate information we collect with our affiliates and other sites operated by and for Maxim. On a confidential basis, Maxim may also share personal information with our corporate affiliates or consultants or with third parties that perform a particular service on our behalf (such as fulfilling orders or for general site administration purposes). Maxim shares aggregate information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes. We may also disclose personal information in response to legal process, such as a request by law enforcement, a court order or subpoena, or to protect the integrity of our site if we believe that a guest has committed unlawful or otherwise harmful acts. 
<br><br>
With the permission of guests 18 years or older, information submitted at the time of registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by us and, also with the permission of the guest, may be shared by us with companies that have agreed with Maxim to use this information only for the marketing and promotion of its products and services. 
<br><br>
If any individual submits content for publication (e.g., Beat This Caption or Reader Mail), we may publish his or her name and any other information submitted by that individual. 
<br><br>
If guests elect to use our “E-mail to a Friend” referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask for the friend’s e-mail address, and we will send an e-mail in response to your request inviting them to visit the site. This information is stored at Maxim Online solely for the purpose of sending the e-mail. 
<br><br>
PUBLIC FORUMS
<br><br>
Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online in chat rooms, message boards, or similar posting areas, the information can be reviewed and collected by anyone. Therefore, do not post any information that you do not want to be made available to the general public. Maxim is not responsible for unsolicited communications that arise from your postings on this site.
<br><br>
PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS FROM THIS SITE
<br><br>
If you purchase a product from this site, information may be collected from you, including your credit card and contact information, for transfer to and use by third party providers of the product. Maxim does not retain this information. Unless otherwise stated, Maxim does not have any responsibility in connection with such purchases and all transactions and use of any customer information are the sole responsibility of the product provider. Be sure to review the product provider’s privacy policy and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have privacy terms that differ from the Maxim Online Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
USE OF IP ADDRESSES
<br><br>
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you log on to the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address, so when a guest requests pages from our site, our servers log the guest's IP address. The IP addresses of our guests are collected only for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, our corporate affiliates or consultants, or with third parties that perform a particular service on our behalf. We do not combine IP addresses with any personally identifying information, nor do we compile any session activity reports by IP address.   
<br><br>
USE OF COOKIES
<br><br>
In cyberspace, cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
<br><br>
Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you’re at a site. The use of cookies is an industry standard-you’ll find them at most major Web sites.
<br><br>
By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not and help in targeting ads based on guest interests. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of guests and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies.
<br><br>
A cookie allows us to store the personal preferences that you set during each visit to our site, which in turn allows us to speed up your future activities at our site. Similarly, the stores hosted by our site usually use cookies to track which products you’ve chosen to purchase while shopping. Letting cookies do the record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again. If you are a subscriber of Maxim Magazine and have registered to access the Maxim Lounge portion of the site, an identifying cookie will be placed on your computer. During future visits to our site, we will only read and retrieve information that we set in a cookie during an earlier visit to our site. 
<br><br>
The ads appearing on Maxim Online are delivered to you by DoubleClick, and other third-party advertising networks. In the course of delivering an ad to you, the advertising provider may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your visits to this site through the use of cookies or similar technology. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices, or to exercise an “opt-out” from DoubleClick’s cookies, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="new">click here.</a>
<br><br>
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers on this site as well. Maxim Online does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to the Maxim Online Privacy Policy. Advertisers do not have access to Maxim Online’s cookies. 
<br><br>
The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.
<br><br>
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you’d prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the shopping, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so. If you have any additional questions or concerns pertaining to the privacy of information collected on this site, send an <a href="http://maximonline.com/talk/" target="new">e-mail.</a>
