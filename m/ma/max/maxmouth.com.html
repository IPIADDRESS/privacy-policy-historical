      <p align="center"><em> Last Updated July 25, 2007</em></p>
      <p align="left"> MaxMouth,  Inc. ("MaxMouth") recognizes that its users who use www.MaxMouth.com  or other web sites owned or operated by Maxmouth (the "MaxMouth  Sites") (collectively or individually "Users") value their privacy.  This privacy policy details important information regarding the use and  disclosure of User information collected on the MaxMouth Sites. By using the MaxMouth Sites, you consent to the collection  and use of your information by us in accordance with this privacy policy.&nbsp; If we update or modify this privacy policy,  we will post the changes on this page so that you will always have the ability  to know what information we collect, how we use the information, and under what  circumstances we deliver the information.&nbsp;  Your continued use of the MaxMouth Site after any changes are posted  constitutes your acceptance of the new terms. This privacy policy is  incorporated into and is subject to the MaxMouth Terms of Use. Your use of the  MaxMouth Sites and any personal information you provide on the MaxMouth Sites  remains subject to the terms of this privacy policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
      <p align="left"> Please  note that any video, image, or other content posted onto the MaxMouth Sites  becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable  information subject to this policy.</p>
      <h2>The  Information MaxMouth Collects</h2>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>User       Provided Information: You provide certain personally identifiable       information (such as your name and email address) to MaxMouth when       choosing to participate in various activities on the MaxMouth Sites such       as creating an account to be a Registered User, uploading videos, posting       messages in our forums or in the video comments section, entering contests       or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or       subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists. </li>
        <li>Cookies       Information: When you visit the MaxMouth Sites, we may send one or more       cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters       - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. MaxMouth uses       both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains       after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your       browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be       removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session       cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can       reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie       is being sent. However, some features of the MaxMouth Sites may not       function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. </li>
        <li>Log File       Information: When you use the MaxMouth Sites, our servers automatically       record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit       any website. These server logs may include information such as your web       request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser       language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of       clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those       pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of       your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your       browser. </li>
        <li>Clear       GIFs Information: When you use the MaxMouth Sites, we may employ       "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the       online usage patterns of our Users anonymously (i.e., in a       non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear       GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are       opened by recipients. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> How MaxMouth Uses Information</h2>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Any       personally identifiable information is voluntarily provided to us.&nbsp; If you submit personally identifiable       information to us through the MaxMouth Sites, then we use your personal       information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and       functionality of the MaxMouth Sites and as otherwise described below. </li>
        <li>Any       personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online       (e.g. on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public       profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and       used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to       other Users when you upload videos, post comments, or vote through the       MaxMouth Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and       comments. Any videos that you submit to the MaxMouth Sites may be       redistributed through the internet and other media channels via the       embedded player functionality described in the Terms of Use, and may be       viewed by the general public. </li>
        <li>We may       use your email address or other personally identifiable information to       send commercial or marketing messages &nbsp;to you.&nbsp;       You have the ability to choose whether or not to receive these       message through your user account that you create when you become a       Registered User (or that you subsequently modify or update). We may also       use your email address non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as       notifying you of major MaxMouth Site changes or for customer service       purposes). </li>
        <li>We use       both your personally identifiable information and certain       non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage       data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, click stream data, etc.) to       improve the quality and design of the MaxMouth Sites and to create new       features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking,       and analyzing User preferences and trends. </li>
        <li>We use       cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information       so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next       time you visit the MaxMouth Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized       content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing       campaigns; and (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of       visitors, pages viewed, etc. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> When MaxMouth Discloses Information</h2>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>We       provide personally identifiable information and       non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated       companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing       such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to       process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use       reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other       appropriate confidentiality and security measures. </li>
        <li>From time       to time we may share your profile information to carefully selected       companies whose products and services may be of interest to you.</li>
        <li>We share       non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage       data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks,       etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the       usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions,       and/or functionality on the MaxMouth Sites. </li>
        <li>We may       release personally identifiable information and/or       non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in       the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state       and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order,       subpoena, or search warrant. </li>
        <li>MaxMouth       also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information       and/or non-personally-identifiable information that MaxMouth believes, in       good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take       precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against       any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement       agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to       protect the rights, property, or personal safety of MaxMouth, our Users or       others. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Your  Choices</h2>
      You  may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through  the MaxMouth Sites, in which case MaxMouth you may not be able to access all of  the services MaxMouth has available to you. You may update or correct your  personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your  account profile page. Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites
      <p>MaxMouth  permits other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve  advertisements within the MaxMouth Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad  networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements  and links that appear on the MaxMouth Sites. They automatically receive your IP  address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as  cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their  advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.<br>
        MaxMouth  does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party  ad servers or ad networks . However, please note that if an advertiser asks  MaxMouth to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages  18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain  channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement by clicking the ad,  the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the  audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information  regarding your use of the MaxMouth Sites that they collect by virtue of you  clicking through on an ad,(such as the number of times you viewed an ad), to  determine which ads to deliver to you.<br>
        You  should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers  or ad networks&nbsp; for more information on  their practices. MaxMouth's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot  control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>
      <h2>Our  Commitment to Data Security</h2>
      <p>MaxMouth  uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to  preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot,  however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to  MaxMouth and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of  information, MaxMouth makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the  security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that  such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by  breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<br>
        <br>
        If MaxMouth learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify  you as required by law so that you can take appropriate protective steps. </p>
      <p> To  protect your privacy and security, we use industry standard security  technologies and we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique  password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making  corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique  password and account information at all times.&nbsp;  You should contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:privacy@maxmouth.com">privacy@maxmouth.com</a> if you believe your  account information or your password has been compromised.</p>
      <h2>We  Are Committed To Children’s' Privacy</h2>
      <p>Protecting  the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason,  MaxMouth does not knowingly collect or maintain any information on the MaxMouth  Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is  directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do  not use or access the MaxMouth Sites at any time or in any manner. If MaxMouth  learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years  of age has been collected on the MaxMouth Sites without verified parental  consent, then MaxMouth will take the appropriate steps to delete this  information.</p>
      <h2>Special  Note to International Users</h2>
      <p>The  MaxMouth Sites are hosted in the United States  and are intended for and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User  accessing the MaxMouth Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region  with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and  disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through  your continued use of the MaxMouth Sites, which are governed by U.S. law, this  Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Use, you are voluntarily transferring your  personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer and  any additional transfers that may subsequently take place.</p>
      <h2>If  there is an Event of Merger, Sale,  or Bankruptcy</h2>
      <p>In  the event that MaxMouth is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we  reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the  information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger,  acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the  benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles  affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your  personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
