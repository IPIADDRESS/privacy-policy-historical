	Max Steingart, who owns and operates the
	<a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">www.maxsteingart.com</a> web site, 
	cares about the privacy of each user of our web site. This privacy statement 
	discloses the privacy practices for <a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">
	www.maxsteingart.com</a> web site.<br><br>If you have any questions or 
	concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact
	<a href="mailto:support@maxsteingart.com">support@maxsteingart.com</a>.<br>
	<br><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><br>The
	<a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">www.maxsteingart.com</a> web site 
	collects information from our users at several different points on our web 
	site. When you use the web site, some basic, general information is 
	collected. This general information is used internally in connection with 
	our business to improve the web site, including our marketing and 
	advertising efforts, and to make your use of the web site as enjoyable and 
	efficient as possible.<br><br>When you set up an account on our web site or 
	purchase an item from our web site, we collect personal information provided 
	by you that may include your: (i) first and last name; (ii) billing address; 
	(iii) shipping address; (iv) other shipping addresses; (v) email address; 
	(vi) phone number; (vii) credit card account number; (viii) items purchased 
	from us; and (ix) browsing, buying and selling patterns. We use this 
	personal information in order to provide you with the goods and services 
	that you purchase on our web site. We use your email address to provide you 
	with information about your order and its status and we may occasionally 
	send out emails, including newsletters, to people who have placed an order 
	on-line, with information about other goods and services available on our 
	web site. Your phone number is used by us only in the event that our agents 
	need to contact you about an order you have placed.<br><br>Max Steingart 
	("we" or "us") owns and operates the <a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">
	www.maxsteingart.com</a> web site and he is the sole owner of this 
	information collected on the web site. We will not sell, share, or rent this 
	information to a third party in any way other than as disclosed in this 
	privacy policy. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in 
	identifying those who use our services for illegal activities and may, in 
	our sole discretion, disclose personal information or other information to 
	satisfy any law, regulation, subpoena, or government request. We reserve the 
	right to release personal information or other information about users who 
	we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in violation 
	of our Terms of Service, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order, if 
	we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary or 
	appropriate to operate our web site or to protect the rights or property of
	<a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">www.maxsteingart.com</a>, our 
	affiliates, or our officers, directors, employees, agents, third-party 
	content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensor's. We also reserve the 
	right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities we reasonably 
	believe in our sole discretion to be unlawful. If we are legally compelled 
	to disclose information about you to a third party, we will attempt to 
	notify you by sending an email to the email address in our records unless 
	doing so would violate the law or unless you have not provided your email 
	address to us.<br><br><strong>Registration</strong><br>To use some features 
	on the <a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">www.maxsteingart.com</a> web 
	site, a user must first complete a registration form on the web site. During 
	registration, a user is required to give contact information, such as name 
	and email address. This information is used to contact users about the 
	services on our web site for which they have indicated interest. It is 
	optional for users to provide additional, demographic information, such as 
	age and gender, but we encourage our users to provide such information so 
	that we can provide a more personalized experience for our users on our web 
	site.<br><br><strong>Orders</strong><br>We request additional personal 
	information from our users when placing an order on our web site. In 
	completing our order form, a user must provide contact information, such as 
	name and shipping address, and financial information, such as credit card 
	account number and expiration date. This information is used for billing 
	purposes and to fulfill our customer orders. If we experience difficulties 
	processing an order, we will contact a user through this information.<br>
	<br><strong>Cookies</strong><br>A cookie is a text file stored on the user's 
	hard drive containing information about the user. Many web sites create 
	cookies to record information about a user's preferences, such as the items 
	you add to your shopping cart, and for security purposes (see Security 
	below). Cookies may also used to help us determine the various services you 
	use and the support you may need, and to help us detect and solve any 
	problems you may have while using our web site. Most cookies expire after a 
	certain time period. If you wish, you may set your browser to reject all 
	cookies and still view our web site. <br><br><strong>Log Files</strong><br>
	Like most standard web sites, we use log files on our servers. These log 
	files store information regarding IP (internet protocol) addresses, browser 
	type, ISP (internet service provider), referring/exit pages, platform type, 
	date/time stamp, and number of clicks. These log files are used to analyse 
	trends, administer the web site, track user's movements in the aggregate, 
	and gather broad demographic information for our use. IP addresses, etc. are 
	not linked to personal information. In addition, we utilize Google Analytics 
	to evaluate traffic on our website. Google Analytics stores information 
	similar to that described above.<br><br><strong>Sharing of General or 
	Demographic Information</strong><br>We may share aggregated, general or 
	demographic information we collect about our users and their use of our web 
	site with our third-party partners and advertisers in a manner which does 
	not identify any individual user. We use an outside shipping company to ship 
	orders placed on our web site, and a credit card processing company to bill 
	users for goods and services purchased on our web site. These companies will 
	not retain, share, store or use any of our user's personal information for 
	any secondary purposes. We may partner with other parties to provide 
	specific services which are available on our web site. When a user signs up 
	for these services, we will share the user's name or other contact 
	information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services 
	to the user. These parties are not allowed to use such personal information 
	except for the purpose of providing these services.<br><br>
	<a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">www.maxsteingart.com</a> partners with 
	Amazon.com to sell books, CD's and tapes.
	<a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">www.maxsteingart.com</a> does not pass 
	any personal information to Amazon and no personal information is shared by 
	Amazon back to <a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">www.maxsteingart.com</a>. 
	Amazon shares aggregate purchase information with
	<a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">www.maxsteingart.com</a> for the 
	purpose of determining revenue share.<br><br><strong>Links</strong><br>The 
	web site contains links to other web sites. We want you to be aware that 
	when you click on such links, including banner advertising, which take you 
	to a third-party web site, you will be subject to such third-party's privacy 
	policies. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy 
	practices of such other web sites and we expressly disclaim any and all 
	liability for the actions of third-parties, including, without limitation, 
	actions relating to the use and/or disclosure of personal information by 
	such third-parties. We encourage our users to be aware of when they leave 
	our web site and enter a third-party web site and to read the privacy 
	statements of each and every web site that collects their personal 
	information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by 
	our web site.<br><br><strong>Newsletter</strong><br>If a user wishes to 
	subscribe to our newsletter, we will ask for contact information, such as 
	name and email address. That information is never sold or shared with other 
	organizations.<br><br><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong><br>From 
	time-to-time, our web site may request information from our users via 
	surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is 
	completely voluntary and the user has a choice whether or not to provide us 
	with such information. Information requested may include contact 
	information, such as name and shipping address, and demographic information, 
	such as zip code, age level. Contact information will be used to notify the 
	winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used to monitor or 
	improve the use and efficiency of this web site. This information will never 
	be sold or shared.<br><br><strong>Security</strong><br>This web site takes 
	precautions we believe are reasonable to protect our users' information. 
	When you submit personal information via our web site, your information is 
	protected by us both on-line and off-line.<br><br>When our registration or 
	order form asks users to enter personal information, such as credit card 
	account number or social security number, such information will be encrypted 
	by our encryption software, which is provided by Secure Socket Layer (SSL), 
	before such information is transmitted over the internet. SSL prevents 
	unauthorized people from intercepting your personal data. It is important to 
	use a browser that supports SSL, such as Google Chrome, Apple Safari or 
	Microsoft Internet Explorer. These browsers show a symbol in the status bar, 
	such as a key or a lock, when you are viewing a web site that uses SSL. To 
	learn more about SSL, you may visit their web site at:
	<a href="http://www.ssl.com" target="_blank">http://www.ssl.com</a>.<br><br>
	While we use SSL encryption to protect users' personal information on-line, 
	we also protect our users' information off-line. All of our users' 
	information, including both general and personal information, is carefully 
	stored in our offices and the facilities of our web hosting provider. Only 
	employees who use such information to perform a specific job (for example, 
	our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access 
	to personal information. In addition, the servers that we store personal 
	information on are kept in a physically and electronically secure 
	environment.<br><br>We make efforts we believe are reasonable to prevent the 
	alteration, theft, loss or misuse of our users' information by others. 
	However, please keep in mind that there is always some risk in transmitting 
	information over the Internet.<br><br>If you have any questions about the 
	security of our web site, you can send an email to
	<a href="mailto:support@maxsteingart.com">support@maxsteingart.com</a><br>
	<br><strong>Communications from our Web Site</strong><br>We send all new 
	members a welcoming email to verify their password and username. Established 
	members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special 
	deals, and a newsletter. Each user has the option to not receive these types 
	of communications (see Choice/Opt-Out below).<br><br>Occasionally, it is 
	necessary to send out service-related announcements. For instance, if our 
	service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email 
	informing you of such service interruption. Generally, users may not opt-out 
	of receiving these service-related communications. In addition, we 
	communicate with our users on a regular basis to provide requested services 
	and regarding issues relating to their account via email.<br><br><strong>
	Correction/Updating Personal Information</strong><br>If a user's personal 
	information changes or if a user no longer desires our service, we will 
	enable our users to correct, update or remove from our web site the personal 
	data they provided to us. Such changes can be made either through the member 
	information page on our web site or by emailing us at
	<a href="mailto:support@maxsteingart.com">support@maxsteingart.com</a>.<br>
	<br><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>Our users are given the opportunity 
	when registering with our web site to opt-out of having their information 
	used for purposes not directly related to the provision of goods or services 
	through our web site. Our membership form has an opt-out mechanism so users 
	purchasing a membership from us may elect to not have their email address 
	added to our marketing and promotional address lists.<br><br>Users who no 
	longer wish to receive our newsletter or other marketing and promotional 
	materials from us or our partners may opt-out of receiving these 
	communications by replying to any such promotional email indicating your 
	desire to no longer receive such emails or by emailing our us at
	<a href="mailto:support@maxsteingart.com">support@maxsteingart.com</a>.<br>
	<br>Users of our web site will be notified if, in connection with the use of 
	a particular service on our web site, their information will be collected by 
	any outside third-party. At such time, the user can determine whether they 
	wish to proceed with a service that will involve an outside party having 
	access to their information.<br><br><strong>Collecting Information From 
	Children Younger than 13</strong><br>The
	<a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">www.maxsteingart.com</a> web site does 
	not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children under 
	the age of 13 without obtaining verifiable parental consent.<br><br><strong>
	Notification of Changes in Use of Information</strong><br>Our privacy policy 
	is subject to change. In the event of any change, we will provide notice of 
	such change on our web site. If we want to use your personal information in 
	a manner different from that stated to you at the time you provided such 
	information to us, we will notify you of such change via email in addition 
	to posting notification of such change on our web site. At such time, you 
	can determine whether you wish to allow us to use your information in this 
	different manner. If you have opted out of all communication with our web 
	site or have deleted or deactivated your account with us, then you will not 
	be contacted and your personal information will not be used.<br><br><strong>
	If you have any questions about this privacy policy or believe that the
	<a href="http://www.maxsteingart.com">www.maxsteingart.com</a> web site is 
	not abiding by our privacy policy, please contact us by e-mail at
