    <p>Please read below to become familiar with our principles and practices.</p><h2>Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>Q: I'm worried about sending my credit-card details over the Internet. Should I be? Can I phone or fax my credit-card details instead of using the Web?</strong> </p><p><strong>A:</strong> Maximuscle have taken many precautions to keep your credit card details safe. All credit card information that is transmitted from your computer to the Maximuscle server is encrypted using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL - see below) protocol. </p><p>We use a secure server with state-of-the-art encryption and Secure Socket Layer server technology. There has never been a case in which any of our consumers lost money as a result of fraudulent card use resulting from a breach of our security as data was transmitted over the Internet. It is widely joked, in the e-commerce industry, that you have more chance of becoming a victim of credit-card fraud by handing your card to a waiter in a restaurant than by sending it over the Internet using SSL. If you do not have a secure browser, or you still feel that you would prefer not to send your credit-card details even with a secure browser, you are welcome to order by phone 24 hours a day(01442 418500) or fax (01442 418501). </p><p><strong>Q: Will you sell my email address to other people who will send me junk mail?</strong> </p><p><strong>A:</strong> No, we won't. In fact, we won't sell your email address to any other organisation. Since customers value their privacy, our business depends on protecting it. </p><h2>Secure Transactions</h2><p>Secure connections on the Maximuscle store are verified and authenticated using our secure server certificate - issued to us by <a href="http://www.trustwise.com/">BT Trustwise / Verisign</a>. You can also check the validity of ourcertificate by double clicking on the glowing padlock that appears on the bottom left or bottom right corner of your browser.Alternatively, please examine the security settings of your browser. </p><p>Our server certificate uses strong 512 bit encryption which means that when it's possible (i.e. your browser is capable), the server will encrypt its communications using this higher level of encryption. If the browser isn't capable of communicating at 512 bits, theserver will switch down to 128 bit or 40 bit encryption. The possibility of someone being able to intercept and decrypt the secure communication between browser and server is very slim indeed. </p><p>An SSL connection is initiated by the client (normally a Web browser) by requesting a document to be sent through the HTTPS protocol as opposed to the standard HTTP protocol. This is done by by simply prefixing the URL by "https" as opposed to "http". For example: </p><p><strong>http://server.domain.com/index.html</strong></p><p>requests the document index.html be sent through the standard HTTP protocol, whilst </p><p><strong>https://server.domain.com/index.html</strong></p><p>requests the same document be sent using the HTTPS protocol which incorporates SSL. </p><h3>Here in detail are the steps taken during an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) transaction:</h3><ul class="bulletList">    <li>The client sends a request for a document to be transmitted using the HTTPS protocol by prefixing the URL with "https". </li>    <li>The server sends its certificate to the client. </li>    <li>The client checks if the certificate was issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) it trusts. If not, it gives the user the option to continue or to terminate the transaction. </li>    <li>The client compares the information in the certificate with the information it just received concerning the site: its domain name and its public key. If the information matches, the client accepts the site as authenticated. </li>    <li>The client tells the server what ciphers, or encryption algorithms, it can communicate with. </li>    <li>The server chooses the strongest common cipher and informs the client. </li>    <li>The client generates a private (or session) key using the agreed cipher. </li>    <li>The client then encrypts the session key using the server's public key and sends it to the server. </li>    <li>The server receives the encrypted session key and decrypts it with its private key. </li>    <li>The client and the server then use the session key for the rest of the transaction. </li></ul><h2>Terms and Conditions</h2><ul class="bulletList">    <li>Maximuscle.com would like to provide you with a strong and compelling reason to visit our site again. Therefore, in order to help us provide an optimal site and service and increase our speed of site download time, we gather the following information in aggregate form: operating system (e.g.Macintosh, Windows - Mac/PC), browser type (e.g. Navigator, Internet Explorer), IP address, and Internet domain (e.g. Virgin, Freeserve, Demon, AOL).

In the instance when Maximuscle uses a third party to fulfill the transaction, the following information is provided to the supplier in order to facilitate the transaction and/or exchange of goods: email address, phone numbers, fax number and payment details, including credit card information. Maximuscle also uses the order information to send the customer information about our company and our services.

Customers can opt-out at any time of receiving these future mailings; see the un-subscribe section above. </li>    <li>Information gathered from contests: occasionally we run contests on our site and the customer's contact information is used to contact the customer when necessary (e.g. to notify you if you have won) and customers are added to our mailing list for future products. Customers may opt-out at any time of receiving future mailings; see the un-subscribe section above. Abbreviated/censored customer names and/or e-mail addresses may be used on our contest winners' page as well. We do not sell, share, trade, rent, or give away any of your personal information on our email lists. </li>    <li>Emails sent to Maximuscle may occasionally be used for testimonial purposes but will be withdrawn from the web site if requested.

However, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Maximuscle disclaims all warranties (express or implied) as to the accuracy of the information contained in any of the materials on this site. </p><p>2.2 Maximuscle shall not be liable to any person for any loss or damage, which may arise from the use of any of the information contained in any of the materials on this site. </p><p>2.3 Certain links in this site (typically a banner advert or icon) will lead to sites which are not under the control of Maximuscle.

Limitation of Liability</h3><p>3.1 You agree that Maximuscle shall not be liable either in contract, tort, negligence, statutory duty or otherwise, for any: </p><p>3.1.1 loss of profits, revenue or goodwill or any type of consequential, indirect or special loss or damage whatever arising from or in any way connected with this Agreement; </p><p>3.1.2 direct loss or damage (including loss or damage which is reasonably foreseeable or occurs naturally in the course of things) resulting from any acts, omissions, failures or delays occurring on or in relation to those parts of the Internet not under Maximuscle's direct control including, without limitation, damage for loss of business, loss of sales, non payment of sums due, loss of profits, business interruption, loss of reputation, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss (even where Maximuscle has been advised of the possiblity of such loss or damage). </p><p>3.2 You also agree that (except in relation to such liability as has been expressly excluded in clause 3.1 above) the maximum aggregate of liability of Maximuscle in contract, tort, negligence, statutory duty or otherwise (even where Maximuscle has been advised of the possibility of such loss or damage), for any loss or damage whatever arising from or in any way connected with: </p><p>3.2.1 any defect in a product; </p><p>3.2.2 any failure by Maximuscle to process signals, data, information, orders or messages correctly or in a timely manner; </p><p>3.2.3 any misrouting or non-delivery of signals, data information, messages or orders from you to other persons or from other persons to you, or any scrambling or distortion of data or information contained in them; and </p><p>3.2.4 any liability not excluded by this Agreement shall, in respect of any one or more events or series or events (whether connected or unconnected) taking place within any twelve month period be limited, in the case of defects falling within clause 3.2.1, to the price of the relevant goods and otherwise to Â£50.
