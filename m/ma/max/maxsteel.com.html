<b><p align="CENTER">Mattel, Inc. Online Privacy Policy</p>
</b><p><b><br>
</b>Mattel is committed to protecting your on-line privacy when visiting any 
web sites operated by us or our family of companies. We do not collect and keep any personal information from you unless you volunteer it and you are 13 or older. We also do not collect and keep personal information on-line from children under the age of 13 without their parent’s consent. Please review the information below to familiarize yourself with our policies on web site privacy, so that you can take full advantage of all the fun stuff available at our sites for you and your family. </p>



<b></b><p><b>A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS:  </b>Mattel adheres to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. in each of our web sites for children.  Parents, you can help by spending time online with your children and monitoring your children's online use.  Please help us protect your child’s privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without your permission. </p>
<b>
</b><p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 18, PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS POLICY WITH YOUR PARENTS AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.  CHILDREN UNDER 13 SHOULD GET YOUR PARENT'S PERMISSION BEFORE GIVING OUT YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO MATTEL - OR TO ANYONE ELSE ON THE INTERNET.</p>
<b>
</b><font color="#ff0000"><strong><p>Does Mattel Collect Any Personal Information About Me if I’m 13 or older?</p>
</strong></font><p>Mattel doesn't require anyone to share any personal information about themselves in order to enjoy any of our web sites. That means you can visit our sites without any need to register with us.  However, most of our sites contain special sections and privileges for members that register. We do not collect any personal information from you unless it is voluntarily provided, for instance when signing a guestbook, registering for contests, downloads, or free demos, completing our online customer surveys or purchasing products.  The personal information we ask for is usually first and last name, mailing address, phone number and an e-mail address.    See below for how we use this information.  Remember, only people who are 18 or older may purchase products from our online stores.</p>
<b>
</b><font color="#ff0000"><strong><p>Does Mattel Collect Any Personal Information About Anyone Under 13?</p>
</strong></font><p>On our websites for children, we do not collect personal information on-line from children under 13 without their parent’s consent except in special, limited circumstances.  If your child is under 13 and wants to use our children’s sites with special activities, like scavenger hunts, personalized pages or clubs, we might ask your child to "register" by giving us a first name and their state.  When we ask for your child’s first name, your child is encouraged to use a "screen name" (not their real name) that only they know.  Sometimes we will ask your child to make up a special password so that only they can see their customized areas on the site.  With your verifiable consent, we may collect personal information from your child such as a last name, address or e-mail address when the information is necessary for a particular activity.  We usually will ask your child for your e-mail or mailing address so that we get your permission for your child to provide the information.  When we ask for your permission, we will tell you what we will do with the information your child provides us, and we will tell you how you can review your child’s information and ask us to delete the information.  We don’t keep your (or your child’s) e-mail address unless you tell us it is ok.</p>

<p>Mattel might collect some information from your child under 13 without your consent, but only in the following special cases:</p>


<ul>
<li>If a child under 13 sends a request to us, we keep their e-mail address for long enough to respond to them.  Mattel deletes this information from our system after we answer their question.</li>
<li>Occasionally, Mattel has special site activities or<font color="#0000ff"> </font>promotions like sweepstakes or contests which are open to children even if they are under 13.  In these activities, we are not allowed to ask for more information from your child than what is<font color="#0000ff"> </font>necessary for your child to participate in the activity.  For instance, we might ask for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your child, any prizes your child wins or we might ask for your e-mail address or telephone number so that we can tell you when your child has won.</li>
<li>We also might collect contact information where it is necessary to protect your child’s safety when they join in activities like our chat rooms, message boards or e-mail services.</li></ul>

<p>In the last two situations when we ask for information without your consent, we require your child to give us your e-mail address, too, so that we can tell you that they have registered in a promotion or for a service.  Any information your child gives us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the promotion, program or activity is concluded, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete.  </p>

<p>You can always ask to review the information your child has submitted to us by sending us a written request addressed to Consumer Relations, Attn: Children’s Online Privacy Act – <i>Information Request</i>, 636 Girard Avenue, East Aurora, New York, 14052.  You must include the address of your child, your child’s password and any other information which will allow us to verify that you are the parent of the child whose information you are requesting. You can ask us to delete your child’s information at any time and, you can ask that we do not collect any more personal information from your child, by sending us a written request addressed to Consumer Relations, Attn: Children’s Online Privacy Act – <i>Delete Request</i>, 636 Girard Avenue, East Aurora, New York, 14052.  However, if you ask us to delete your child’s information, we may have to ask your child not to participate in our activities.</p>

<b><font color="#ff0000"><p>What Does Mattel Do With the Information We Collect?</p>
</font></b><p>We use the personal information we collect for the purposes indicated at the time you provide such information.  For instance, if you register in a contest, we will use the registration information to notify contest winners, or if you purchase a product, we will use the information to fulfill the order.  Occasionally, and only with consent at the time we ask for information, we might also e-mail or mail you to provide information on upcoming Mattel products, web site updates and promotions.  With your consent, we may also share information with other Mattel brands like Barbie<font face="Symbol">â</font>
 and HotWheels<font face="Symbol">â</font>
 and Mattel family companies so that they can let you and your family know about their products which might be of interest.  If you want to stop receiving such updates and product information from Mattel or our affiliates at any time, just e-mail us at service@mattel.com.  Please type "Unsubscribe" in the subject line of the e-mail.  Our mailings and e-mails will also include information allowing you to ask not to receive such information in the future.</p>
<b><font color="#ff0000">
</font></b><font color="#ff0000"><strong></strong></font><p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Does Mattel Share Information About Me With Others?</strong><br>
</font>If you consent, Mattel may provide your information to outside companies that offer products or services that may be of interest if you are a teenager (over 12) or an adult.  Except for maintenance and security reasons, we never share personal information that we receive from children under 13 with other companies.  We will remove your name from the list we provide to outside companies, if you just e-mail us at service@mattel.com.  Please note in the subject line "Outside Mailings."  In special circumstances, Mattel may give other companies access to our information database, but only if necessary to allow them to provide database or server maintenance or security or other similar services to Mattel.  If we do provide access, we require those other companies to sign confidentiality agreements promising to keep secret any information they see.  If Mattel believes that anyone’s behavior on our sites may damage us or our sites or anyone else, we may disclose the relevant personal information in order to prevent this harm.  In that case, we might try to identify the wrongdoer, contact them or bring legal action against them.  We may also disclose personal information if we believe that the disclosure is required by law.</p>

</b><font color="#ff0000"><strong></strong></font><p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>How Does Mattel Use Cookies?</strong><br>
</font>A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer’s hard drive which contains non-personal information.  Our cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited; they allow you to personalize your pages; and they help you to participate in some activities or events on the site.  For instance, some of our sites have scavenger or treasure hunts, and we need to use cookies to keep track of your progress.  If you leave the site and then return, cookies will tell us what things you have already collected so that you do not have to start all over again.  We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit our sites, which of our web pages they stop at and how long they stay there.  This information helps us figure out which of our web features are a smashing success and what sites might need improvement!  For administrative purposes, we collect IP addresses, which is the automatic number assigned to your computer when you surf the web.  The IP address allows us to count total number of "hits" on our sites.  However, your IP address and cookie is not connected to any personally identifiable or on-line contact information like a name and address, so you and your family remain anonymous.</p>
<b><font color="#ff0000">
</font></b><font color="#ff0000"><strong><p>Does Mattel Ever Collect Information without Consent? </p>
</strong></font><p>Mattel does not collect information passively through cookies or other tracking mechanisms except in the circumstances described above.  Cookies DON’T contain any personal information about a specific user.  We don’t use cookies or other non-consensual methods to take personally identifiable or on-line contact information about you or your family off of your computer.  Except for certain activities like treasure hunts, which we talked about above, Mattel doesn’t use cookies for direct marketing or promotional purposes.  Cookies are also not used to collect information specifically about you or your family for sharing with third parties. </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><strong>
</strong></font><strong></strong><p><strong><font color="#ff0000">And Finally…</font></strong><br>
We want you and your family to have fun surfing all our sites and urge you and your family to follow common sense whenever disclosing personal information - on this site or anywhere on the Internet. <br>
<br>
Thanks for reading our privacy statement. We hope you have a better understanding of the many activities offered on our web sites and the ways in which we really are committed to safeguarding online privacy.  Remember, we may change our policy from time to time to conform to changing legal requirements or to better protect your information.  When this happens we will notify you of the new policy by posting it on our sites.</p>
