<br>
 3.1 those who provide products or services to us, or products or
services that support the services that we provide, such as our

out</a> of receiving marketing material from us or carefully
selected third parties who we reasonably believe provide products
or services that may be of interest to you, we may also provide
your personal information to those third parties.&nbsp; We will
only do this where those third parties have contracted with
Auckland Transport to keep the information confidential, or are
subject to obligations to protect your personal information.</p>

<h3><a id="Cookies" name="Cookies"></a>4. Cookies</h3>

<p><br>
 "Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to an
individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes.&nbsp; The
cookie assigns you an ID which allows Auckland Transport to
recognise you when you return to one of our websites.&nbsp; We use
cookies to deliver content specific to your interests so users do
not have to register each time they use our websites.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Protecting" name="Protecting"></a>5. Protecting your
personal information</h3>

<p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal
information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete,
up-to-date and stored in a secure environment protected from
unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure.<br>
 &nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Retention" name="Retention"></a>6. Retention and
storage</h3>

<p>We may retain all personal information that we collect (on both
our active systems and our archive systems), for as long as is
necessary for us to carry out the purposes for which the
information was collected (including for the purpose of providing
services to you). For registration and account information, this
means that the information is likely to be retained for the period
of time that we consider your account (registered card or online
account) to be "active". An "inactive" card is where the card is
not used and no Stored Value or Period Passes are added to the card
for a continuous period of 2 years.<br>
<br>
 The location at which we store your personal information will
depend on the nature and purpose of the information and the manner
in which you supply it to us. We may use, process, and store your
personal information at our premises and/or storage facilities
(whether in New Zealand or overseas).</p>

<h3><a id="Accessing" name="Accessing"></a>7. Accessing your
personal information</h3>

information about you.&nbsp; You also have the right to access your
personal information, if we hold that personal information in a way
that it can be readily retrieved. You may request access to the
personal information we hold about you by sending an email to
PrivacyOfficer@aucklandtransport.govt.nz.<br>
<br>
 You can ask to see the personal information that we hold about
you, or make a request for information under the Local Government

information that we hold about you by sending a written request to
the above address. It is your responsibility to ensure that

correct your information in the way you have asked, you can request
that we attach to that information a statement of the correction
you asked for.<br>
<br>
 When writing to us, please quote your name and address. We would
be grateful if you could also provide brief details of what
information you want a copy of (this helps us to more readily
locate your data).<br>
<br>

copies of your personal information to you. If so, we will advise
you of this prior to sending your information to you.&nbsp;</p>
