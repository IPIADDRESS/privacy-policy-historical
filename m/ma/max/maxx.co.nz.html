<h3><a id="Cookies" name="Cookies"></a>4. Cookies</h3>

<p>"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to
an individual's device's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
The cookie assigns that device an ID that allows Auckland Transport
to recognise it when it is used to access an Auckland Transport
website.</p>

<p>We use cookies on Auckland Transport websites to collect
standard internet log information and details of our visitors'
behaviour patterns in order to&nbsp; obtain statistics of the
number of visits and the popular parts of those website.&nbsp;
These&nbsp; statistics are gathered and used solely for the
purposes of analysing, evaluating and improving the content of

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Protecting" name="Protecting"></a>5. Protecting your

unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure.<br>
 &nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Retention" name="Retention"></a>6. Retention and
storage</h3>

<p>We may retain all personal information that we collect (on both
our active systems and our archive systems), for as long as is
necessary for us to carry out the purposes for which the
information was collected (including for the purpose of providing
services to you). For registration and account information, this
means that the information is likely to be retained for the period
of time that we consider your account (registered card or online
account) to be "active". An "inactive" card is where the card is
not used and no Stored Value or Period Passes are added to the card
for a continuous period of 2 years.<br>
<br>
 The location at which we store your personal information will
depend on the nature and purpose of the information and the manner
in which you supply it to us. We may use, process, and store your
