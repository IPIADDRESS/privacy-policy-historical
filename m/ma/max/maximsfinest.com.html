    <br><h4>Do we use 'cookies'?</h4><hr>

    <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider
        transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser
        (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's
        systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain
        information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and
        process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help
        us understand your preferences based on previous or current site
        activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.
        We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site
        traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site
        experiences and tools in the future.</p>

    <p><strong>We use cookies to:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Understand and save user's preferences for future
            visits.</li>

        <li>Keep track of advertisements.</li>

        <li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site
            interactions in order to offer better site experiences and
            tools in the future. We may also use trusted third party
            services that track this information on our behalf.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie
        is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do
        this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each
        browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu
        to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

    <p>If you disable cookies, some features will be disabled It will
        turn off some of the features that make your site experience more
        efficient and some of our services will not function
        properly.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <br><h4>Third Party Disclosure</h4><hr>

    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties
        your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with
        advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and
        other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting
        our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to
        keep this information confidential. We may also release your
        information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with
        the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others'
        rights, property, or safety.</p>

        provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other
        uses.</p>
    
    <br><h4>Third Party Links</h4><hr>

    <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third
        party products or services on our website. These third party sites
        have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have
        no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of
        these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity
        of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

    
    <br><h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h4><hr>

    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require
        commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
        The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a
        person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world)
        that operates websites collecting personally identifiable
        information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
        policy on its website stating exactly the information being
        collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and
        to comply with this policy. - See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p>

    <p><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the
            following:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>

        <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to
            it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant
            page after entering our website.</li>

        <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and
            can be easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Users are able to change their personal information:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>By emailing us</li>

        <li>By calling us</li>

        <li>By logging in to their account</li>

        <li>By chatting with us or sending us a ticket</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How does our site handle do not track
            signals?</strong></p>

    <p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies,
        or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is
        in place.</p>

    <p><strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral
            tracking?</strong></p>

    <p>It's also important to note that we allow third party behavioral
        tracking</p>

    <br><h4>Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</h4><hr>

    <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from
        children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
        (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the
        nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which
        spells out what operators of websites and online services must do
        to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

    <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

    <br><h4>Fair Information Practices</h4><hr>

    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
        privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have
        played a significant role in the development of data protection
        laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
        Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
        with the various privacy laws that protect personal
        information.</p>

    <p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices
            we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach
            occur:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>We will notify the users via email within 7 business
            days</li>

        <li>We will notify the users via in site notification within 7
            business days</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which
        requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally
        enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail
        to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
        individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
        that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to
        investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

    <br><h4>CAN SPAM Act</h4><hr>

    <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial
        email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives
        recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to
        them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

    <p><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other
            requests or questions.</li>

        <li>Process orders and to send information and updates
            pertaining to orders</li>

        <li>e may also send you additional information related to your
            product and/or service.</li>

        <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our
            clients after the original transaction has occurred</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>To be accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the
            following:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email
            addresses</li>

        <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable
            way</li>

            headquarters</li>

        <li>Monitor third party email marketing services for
            compliance, if one is used.</li>

        <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</li>

        <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom
            of each email</li>
