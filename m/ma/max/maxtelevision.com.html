			<p>1.<u style="font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;">INFORMATION COVERED BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY</u></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<u style="font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;">Information You Provide</u>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We may collect personal data, including your name, email or street address, date of birth, telephone number, your preferences and interests, or other information you provide to us or grant us access to ("<strong>Personal Data/Information</strong>") when you register for newsletters, communicate with us, or take part in interactive games, features or competitions.

The Sites may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. Please note that information submitted to the Sites via a "contact us" or other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<u style="font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;">Information We Collect Automatically As You Access and Use the Sites</u>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites or SPN content, SPN, as well as any third-party advertisers, content providers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used ("<strong>Usage Information</strong>"). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page &amp; video views. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if SPN associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, SPN treats it as Personal Information.<br>SPN also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier ("<strong>Device Identifier</strong>") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, "<strong>Device</strong>") you use to access the Sites. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Sites.</p>
			<p>The technologies used on the Sites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include:</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<u style="font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</u>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>By using the Site, you consent to our cookies.</p>
			<p><strong>Cookie:</strong>&nbsp;A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-into or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Sites may not function properly. The use of cookies on the Site allows you to enjoy more seamless visits and more accurately measures your behaviour on the Site. There are two types of cookies that we may use: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your Device when you close the browser software. Persistent cookies remain on your Device after the browser has been closed. The cookies used on the Site do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself voluntarily. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: by asking the browser to remember your username and password, by responding to a promotional offer, or by personalizing a web page or requesting more information on a product or service.</p>

			<p><strong><u>Web beacons</u></strong>: (also known as clear gifs) are used in combination with cookies to help Site operators understand how you interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site or in an email. The use of a clear gif allows the Site to measure your actions in opening the page that contains the clear gif.</p>

			<p><strong><u>Embedded Scripts</u>:</strong>&nbsp;An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>

			<p><strong><u>Log File Information</u>:&nbsp;</strong>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view. Your IP address does not identify you personally.</p>
		
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<u style="font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;">How We Use Cookies and Web Beacons:</u>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="margin-left:18pt;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study traffic patterns in order to improve website performance, to customize the user experience, and to better match the users' interests and preferences. For example, SPN keeps track of the domains from which people visit, and also measures visitor activity on SPN websites. However, these tracking records are performed and maintained in ways that keep the data non-identifiable.</p>
			<p style="margin-left:18pt;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using SPN products or services.</p>
			<p style="margin-left:18pt;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support security measures, such as requiring re-login into a SPN product or service after a certain amount of time has elapsed.</p>
			<p style="margin-left:18pt;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you login to our products through the Site, cookies can also be used to save the username so that we can process the saved login information and quickly log you into the product.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature on our Sites (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the Sites with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Sites with that third party web site or service, which may then collect information about your visits to our Sites and may publish that activity as you request to your "profile" or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share content you find on one of our Sites with your "connections" on the third party's web site or service). The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. However, the information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us or with other third parties, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party's web site or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.</p>

We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with information we collect through the Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>
