      <p><b>Maintenance and Security of Personal Information.</b> mail2web.com
        retains Personal Information about Users as long as mail2web.com believes
        it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. Currently,
        mail2web.com holds the Personal Information in the City of Toronto, Ontario,
        Canada. </p>
      <p>Personal Information about Users that is maintained on our systems
        is protected using industry standard security measures and mail2web.com
        complies with the security safeguards principal of Schedule 1, Clause
        4.7 of PIPEDA. However, we cannot guarantee that the information submitted
        to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be completely
        secure and transmission of information over the Internet is susceptible
        to possible loss, misrouting, interception and misuse. </p>
      <p><b>Access to Personal Information.</b> mail2web.com provides individuals
        with access to Personal Information held about them and complies with
        the individual access principal of Schedule 1, Clause 4.9 of PIPEDA.</p>
      <p>Pursuant
        to Schedule 1, Clause 4.9.5 of PIPEDA, if You believe that Your Personal
        Information on file is not correct, You may request an update of that
        information by sending a request to the person indicated below. Alternatively,
        Customized and Premium Service Users can update Personal Information
        through the web-based Control Panel at anytime. mail2web.com reserves

        4.9.5 of PIPEDA, You may also request that mail2web.com delete Your Personal
        Information from mail2web.com’s system and records
        . However, due to technical constraints and the fact that mail2web.com
        backs up its systems, Personal Information may continue to reside in
        mail2web.com’s
        systems after deletion for some time. Individuals, therefore, should
        not expect that their Personal Information would be completely removed
        from mail2web.com’s
        systems in response to an accepted request for deletion. Any Personal
        Information You provide in connection with the Customized or Premium

        per Division 1, Clause 9 of PIPEDA, mail2web.com reserves the right to
        decline access to Personal Information where disclosure of the information
        requested is not required.</p>
      <p>Pursuant to the principal in Schedule 1, Clause
        4.9.4 of PIPEDA, where information will not or cannot be disclosed, the
        individual making the request will be provided with the reasons for non-disclosure.
        Where information will be disclosed, mail2web.com will endeavour to provide
        the information in question within a reasonable time and no later than
        thirty (30) working days following the request. </p>
      <p>mail2web.com will not respond to repetitious
        or vexatious requests for access. In determining whether a request is
        repetitious or vexatious, mail2web.com will consider such factors as
        the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which
        the information is used, and the nature of the information.</p>
      <p>To guard against
        fraudulent requests for access, mail2web.com will require sufficient
        information to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making
        the request before granting access or making corrections.</p>
