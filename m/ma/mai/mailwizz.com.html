					• processed legally, fairly and transparently, observing the principles of legality, fairness, and transparency;<br>
					• collected for determined, explicit, and legitimate purposes and will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes; further processing for public interest archiving purposes, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes is not deemed incompatible with the original purposes;&nbsp;<br>
					• adequate, relevant and limited to what is required in relation to the purposes for which it is processed.<br>

					• kept in a form that allows for the identification of the data subjects for a period that does not exceed the period required for the fulfilment of the purposes for which the data is processed;&nbsp;<br>
					• processed in a way that ensures the adequate security of personal data, including the protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing, loss, destruction or accidental damage, by taking the appropriate technical or organisational measures.<br>

					THE PURPOSES OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION<br>

					LEGAL BASIS&nbsp;<br>
					The collection and processing of personal data for the purposes mentioned above is based on:<br>
					• The signature (including the pre-contract stages), execution, and management of a contract; the purchase of a license to use the application represents a valid contract between you and ONETWIST SOFTWARE.<br>

					• when this disclosure is made under the law to protect the rights and interests of ONETWIST SOFTWARE;<br>
