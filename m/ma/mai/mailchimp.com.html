Information We Collect</h2><ol>
<li>
<strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong> When you register to use the Services, communicate with our customer service team, send us an email, or post on our blog, you’re giving us information that we collect. That information may include your IP address, name, physical address, email address, phone number, credit card information, and other details like gender, occupation, and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, and stored by us, only as described in our <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a> and Privacy Policy.
</li>
<li>
<strong>List and Email Information</strong>: When you add an email Distribution List or create an email with the Services, we have access to the data on your list and the information in your email.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Information from your Use of the Service</strong>: We may get information about how and when you use the Services. This information may include your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions taken by you within the application.

We use those cookies to collect information about when you visit our Website, when you use the Services, your browser type and version, your operating system, and other similar information. You may turn off cookies that have been placed on your computer by following the instructions on your browser, but if you block our cookies, it may be more difficult (and maybe even impossible) to use the Services. When you play one of the videos on the Websites, the Flash player may use local shared objects, which are also called Flash cookies. We don’t use these Flash cookies for anything, but we can’t stop the player from dropping them (we tried).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Web Beacons</strong>: When we send emails to registered MailChimp customers, we'll sometimes track who opened the emails and who clicked the links. We do that to measure our Email Campaigns’ performance and to improve our features for specific segments of customers. To do this, we include single pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create the reports you see about who has or hasn’t opened emails or clicked links. Reports are also available to us when we send you email, so we may collect and review that information.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Information from Other Sources</strong>: We may get more information about you, like name, age, and participation in social media websites, by searching the internet or querying third parties (we’ll refer to that information as <span class="tip-anchor" data-target="#tooltip-supplemental-member-information" title="We use this “Supplemental Member Information” to develop features like Social Pro, a tool that helps you learn about your subscribers and send them more relevant content.">Supplemental Member Information</span>).
