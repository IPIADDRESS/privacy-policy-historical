					<h1>MailFall Privacy Policy</h1>

					<p>
						<b>Please note:</b> you should have no expectation of privacy when sending messages to your MailFall inbox.
					</p>

					<p>
						Any message sent to MailFall can be read by any user.
					</p>

					<p>
						Every inbox on MailFall is available to the public.
					</p>

					<p>
						There are - by design - no security measures to sign into MailFall and view e-mail messages.
					</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>Do Not Send Sensitive Information to MailFall. </h3>

					<p>
						Please do not send any information to MailFall that you would consider personal or private. This includes
						your home address, your phone number, or any other personal information. Even if you are constantly
						monitoring the MailFall inbox you gave to the third party website/app, it is extremely likely that someone
						else could be watching that inbox as well.
					</p>

					<p>
						While it may be unlikely that someone can guess a random inbox, especially if you're using an inbox
						alias, there is no guarantee that other people don't have access to your e-mail messages. Please treat
						MailFall as if someone else were watching over your shoulder at all times.
					</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>MailFall Inbox Aliases are Not Secure.</h3>

					<p>
						While inbox aliases are meant to be a layer of obfuscation to the real e-mail address in mailfall.com, you
						should be aware that the algorithm which converts from real addresses to inbox aliases, and vice versa, is
						public, and can be easily reverse engineered by a determined individual.
					</p>

					<p>
						Inbox aliases are fine for sending random website/app e-mails to, but again, please do not send any
						private, personal, confidential messages to an inbox alias; it is extremely likely that someone can
						and will figure out the true inbox that the message is delivered to.
					</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>Connections to MailFall are Logged.</h3>

					<p>
						In order to help refine the service, all e-mail and web connections to MailFall are logged. MailFall is not
						designed to be completely anonymous and is not designed to be an alternative to a re-mailer. There are
						plenty of anonymous re-mailers available on the Internet; MailFall is not one of them.
					</p>

					<p>
						The debugging and connection information that we log is helpful to us, but we cannot provide end users
						with any information about "what happened to my e-mail".
					</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>We Do Not Track our Visitors.</h3>

					<p>
						Finally, the only cookie we use is to keep track of the most recent inbox that you've visited. We do
						not track our users, nor do we use cookies to keep personal information. We do not collect any information
						about our end users beyond their e-mail and web connections to mailfall.com and only use our analytics pixel
						to collect aggregate data.
					</p>
