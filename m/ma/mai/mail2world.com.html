We will retain your information for as long as your account is active and in good standing to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 
<br><br>
<b>Principle 3.&nbsp;We will safeguard any information that you provide to us.</b> Your Personally Identifiable Information and email address is used only for demographic statistics, to display appropriate individualized advertisements, process credit card payments and purchase domain names. Mail2World keeps all of your Personally Identifiable Information and email addresses private, sharing that information only as necessary. We may share your information with third parties who provide services on our behalf to help with our business activities. These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
<br><br>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website. Mail2World does not store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

<b>Principle 5.&nbsp;The Mail2World contains links to other web sites and assumes no responsibility for content or policies of those sites.</b> Please note that when you follow one of these links, you are entering another web site. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policies on the other sites, as their privacy policies may be different than ours.
<br><br>
<b>Principle 6.&nbsp;You may opt-out of receiving all Mail2World communications except the 'Site &amp; Service' administrative notifications. Site &amp; Service notifications are critical to your email service operation.</b> Other communications include the Mail2World Membership Newsletter. In the future, they may also include opt-in opportunities for you to receive information from other companies. You may opt out of receiving the newsletter by selecting 'Options' on the Mail2World site, clicking on 'Profile' to access your personal profile information, or you can contact us at support@mail2world.com and finally, deselecting the newsletter option (unchecking the checkbox) near the bottom of the registration page.
<br><br>
<b>Principle 7.&nbsp;You will be notified of any changes in our email practices, Personally Identifiable Information collection processes, the way we use that information or our privacy policy itself.</b> If we decide to make changes in our email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we make material changes to the way we use your email address, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page, prior to the change becoming effective. If we are going to use your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change prior to it becoming effective. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
<br><br>
<b>Principle 8.&nbsp;Surveys and Contests will be featured from time to time on the Mail2World site. Mail2World will manage all information collected during those activities.</b> If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). There may be instances where when the information is shared with partners in specific projects (contests, for example, where a third-party becomes a substantial partner). These third parties will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 
<br><br>
<b>Principle 9.&nbsp;We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We will inform our customers how to notify us about errors, which we will promptly correct.</b> If at any time you believe that Mail2World has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at policy@Mail2World.com, and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.
<br><br>
If you have questions about this policy, please email us at support@mail2world.com.

<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b>
<br><br>
<b><span style="color:#0033CC">What are Cookies?</span></b>
<br><br>
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make a Website more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major web sites like Mail2World use them to provide useful features for their customers.
<br><br>
Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so.
<br><br>
Once a user is logged into a Mail2World email account, our cookies tie in with that user's member ID, which is related to a username and email address. Personally identifiable Information is also tied to a user's IP address for security purposes, such as investigating illegal use of an email account or when a user asks us to find out if an intruder has accessed his or her account.
<br><br>
Mail2World uses cookies so that you can maintain your identity (and thus, your privacy, personalization and preferences) throughout the site. For example, we identify you as a member, a system administrator or a content administrator, and those identities determine what you may do while on the site. In another example, we know which choices you made under the 'Options' section of the site, so those preferences will be carried along with your throughout the email service. Cookies enable Mail2World's privacy, personalization and preferences capabilities.
<br><br>
<b><span style="color:#0033CC">How does Mail2World use my Contacts information?</span></b>
<br><br>
Mail2World stores, processes and maintains your Contacts data in order to provide the service to you. Any third-party contact's personally identifiable information that you may have entered into Contacts (e.g., friends, family, and coworkers) is private and is not used for any purpose by Mail2World. The information collected in our Add Contact form includes names, titles, email addresses, phone numbers, IM names, Skype names, mailing addresses, birthdays, anniversaries, names of spouses or partners, employer's company and department, professional titles, work addresses, work web site, work manager's name, fax number and pager number. 
<br><br>
<b><span style="color:#0033CC">When I import my address book from another email account, how is that information handled?</span></b>
<br><br>
Mail2World offers an Import Contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts that you may have listed in other email address books. Through our Import/Export Wizard, we make it easy for you to manually step through the process of accessing your contact information (e.g., Gmail account, .CSV file, vCard), then the Wizard automatically imports the contact information (i.e., contact names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, etc.) into your Mail2World Contacts. 
<br><br>
Mail2World's Contacts also allows you to request updates from your contacts by clicking the Request Update button in a contact's information panel. The invitation to update will be delivered in an email message displaying your "From" name, and the subject line will read: "[Contact's Name]: Update Your Contact Info."
<br><br>
<b><span style="color:#0033CC">Does Mail2World collect other forms of information about its users?</span></b>
<br><br>
In addition to the use of personally identifiable Information to operate the site, Mail2World also gathers anonymous information, which may be used by Mail2World or shared with its advertisers. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data" or "log files" and may entail the use of "IP addresses", "Protocol version", "Total access time", or other numeric codes used to identify a computer. No tracking technologies are used within email communications our users send out or on pages where email addresses are collected.
<br><br>
<b><span style="color:#0033CC">How do I correct or change Personally identifiable Information that I have given to Mail2World?</span></b>
<br><br>
You may update this information at any time from within your Mail2World account by clicking the 'Options' button on the navigation bar, and then clicking on the ‘Profile' link.
<br><br>
<b><span style="color:#0033CC">Is my Personally identifiable Information secure from others using the Mail2World site?</span></b>
<br><br>
The security of your personally identifiable Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information, such as a credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link.
<br><br>
Mail2World follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personally Identifiable Information and email addresses you submit to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100-percent secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
<br><br>
We limit access to Personally Identifiable Information and email addresses to employees whom we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about security on the Mail2World Web site, you can send us an email at support@mail2world.com or click here to use our support form.
<br><br>
<b><span style="color:#0033CC">How is Mail2World registration information used in the Mail2World Directory and how can I remove my name from the Directory?</span></b>
<br><br>
During the Mail2World registration process you are given the choice as to whether you want to be listed in the Mail2World Directory. If you did not make a choice during the initial registration process, your registered name and location is listed in the Mail2World Directory. At any time, you can change or remove your personally identifiable information from the Mail2World Directory by clicking the 'Options' button on the navigation bar, and then clicking on the 'Profile' link.
<br><br>
Questions regarding this policy should be directed to support@mail2world.com.
