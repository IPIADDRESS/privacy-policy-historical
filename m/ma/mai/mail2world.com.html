Or you may simply not use your email account, in which case it will automatically deactivate after 30 days of non-use.<br><br>





   <b style="font-size:12px">Principle 3.</b>&nbsp;<b>We will safeguard any information that you provide
to us.</b> Your Personally Identifiable Information and email address is used only for demographic statistics, to display appropriate individualized advertisements, process credit card payments and purchase domain names.

   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="0033CC" style="font-size:12px"><b>What are Cookies?</b></font><br><br>
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make a Website more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major web sites like Mail2World use them to provide useful features for their customers.<br><br>
Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so.<br><br>
Once a user is logged into a Mail2World email account, our cookies tie in with that user's member ID, which is related to a username and email address. Personal Information is also tied to a user's IP address for security purposes, such as investigating illegal use of an email account or when a user asks us to find out if an intruder has accessed his or her account.<br><br>

   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="0033CC" style="font-size:12px"><b>Does Mail2World collect other forms of information about its users?</b></font><br><br>
In addition to the use of Personal Information to operate the site, Mail2World also gathers anonymous information, which may be used by Mail2World or shared with its advertisers. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data" or "log files" and may entail the use of "IP addresses", "Protocol version", "Total access time", or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.<br><br>

   <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="0033CC" style="font-size:12px">Is my Personal Information secure from others using the Mail2World site?</font></b><br><br>
The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information, such as a credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this <a target="_blank" href="ssl.asp">link</a>. <br><br>
Mail2World follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personally Identifiable Information and email addresses you submit to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100-percent secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. <br><br>


We limit access to Personally Identifiable Information and email addresses to employees whom we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information.
<br><br>
