Protecting your privacy is important to MAINGEAR, and this   statement is intended to make you aware of our commitments to you as an   important visitor to our website. This policy may change from time to time, so   please check back periodically. </p>
		  <p class="style2">•&nbsp; Scope of the Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies only   to the collection and use of information collected online on the MAINGEAR   Website. Other websites that may be affiliated with MAINGEAR may have different   privacy policies. </p>
		  <p class="style2">•&nbsp; Information. We may collect your personally identifiable   information (“Personal Information”) when you visit the MAINGEAR Website.   Personal Information, however, is not collected on this website unless you   choose to provide it to us. When making inquiries, ordering a product or   requesting service information, participating in certain promotional activities,   completing surveys, and generally corresponding with us, we may ask for certain   Personal Information, including, for example, your name, mailing address, phone   number and email address. If you are on a part of our website that requires you   to provide your Personal Information, it will be clear what Personal Information   we are requesting. We may also collect other information that is provided to us   by your web browser. This may include the browser you used to come to our   website, the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website that you just   visited before visiting our website, which pages on our website you visit, any   search terms you entered, which URL you go to next, and your Internet Protocol   (“IP”) address. </p>
		  <p class="style2">•&nbsp; Use of your information. Information is collected and used in   various ways that will help us better serve our customers and visitors to our   website, including those below. </p>
		  <p class="style2">•&nbsp; Browsing. Information collected while browsing through our   website. This information is collected to help run our site more efficiently, to   gather broad demographic information, to monitor the level of activity on our   site, and to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising and promotion. </p>
		  <p class="style2">•&nbsp; Product Inquiries, Placing Orders, Customer Service &amp;   Technical Support. Information collected when you contact MAINGEAR about our   product and service offerings.

		  <p class="style2">•&nbsp; Promotional activities. When you enter a contest or other   promotion, we may ask you for information such as your name, address and e-mail   address to administer the program or activity, to send you promotional e-mails,   notify winners and make the winners' list publicly available in compliance with   laws which may apply to such activities. </p>
		  <p class="style2">•&nbsp; Newsletters and promotional e-mails. As a service to our   customers, we may e-mail you newsletters, promotional information and other   information, using your Personal Information collected online.

Should such a combination or   acquisition occur, you should expect that MAINGEAR would share some or all of   your Personal Information to continue serving you and other users of our   website. Occasionally, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial   authorities to provide your Personal Information to the appropriate authorities.   We will disclose your Personal Information if required by law, upon receipt of a   court order or subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation.

		  <p class="style2">•&nbsp; Use of cookies and web beacons. </p>
		  <p class="style2">•&nbsp; Cookies. A “cookie” is a small data file that a website can   send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. We use cookies to   better serve you when you return to our site. Some of our web pages may send   cookies when you visit our site, make purchases, respond to online surveys or   promotions, participate in a contest, or request information. Accepting the   cookies used on our site enables our web server to identify your system by   reading the cookie that has been stored on your system, but our web server   cannot identify you unless you enter your Personal Information. Cookies that are   placed when visiting our site cannot be used to obtain your Personal Information   at another site. The information collected online permits us to analyze traffic   patterns on our site. This can enable us over time to provide users with a   better experience on our site by improving the content and making it easier to   use. Depending on the browser used, you can set your browser to notify you   before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept   it, and you can also set your browser to turn off cookies. However, if you do   so, some areas of this site may not function properly, or you will be required   to re-enter your Personal Information to use an area of this site. </p>
		  <p class="style2">•&nbsp; Web Beacons. We may also use web beacon technologies to better   tailor the site to provide better customer service. A web beacon is a single   pixel .GIF that allows a website to count users who have visited that page or   access certain cookies. These web beacons may be placed on specific pages across   this website. When a visitor accesses these pages, an anonymous notice of that   visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our vendors. These web   beacons work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want to associate your   anonymous cookie information with your visits to these pages, depending on the   browser used, you can set your browser to turn off cookies. </p>
