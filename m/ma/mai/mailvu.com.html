            systems are
            located in controlled facilities<br>

            mail messages are limited-access, where access is gained
            through an<br>
            obscured URL system. This obscured URL makes it difficult if
            not
            impossible for a third party to guess the<br>
            URL address of your content
            without an invitation from you including the relevant URL.
            However,
            unless<br>
            the videos and content are password protected, your invitees
            may forward the URL link to other parties and<br>
            a possibility exists
            that an unauthorized third party could discover your videos
