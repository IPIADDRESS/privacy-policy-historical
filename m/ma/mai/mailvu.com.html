<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Updated as of: September 2011</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>
  mailVU.com is a part of the A2Stream Inc. family of businesses. We are committed to protecting your<br>
  privacy. This Privacy Policy provides our privacy practices in regards to the information we collect<br>
  when you or your computer interact with our website. By accessing http://mailVU.com or A2Stream's<br>
  applications or widgets for social networks (including but not limited to Facebook), you acknowledge<br>
  and fully understand this Privacy Policy, agree to be bound by the terms contained in this Policy, and<br>
  freely consent to the information collection and use practices described in this Policy.</p>
<p>You further acknowledge and agree that you are at least 18 years old, or have the permission of a<br>
  parent or guardian. If you are under 18 years old and don't have permission from a parent or guardian<br>
  you do not have permission to use this site. We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role<br>
  in their children's online activities and interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Public Areas</h3>
<p>
  mailVU.com may make certain information such as forums and blogs available to the public. The user<br>
  must remember that all information disclosed in public areas such as forum comments or feedback<br>
  comments may be publicly accessible. We cannot control who reads your postings or what they<br>
  do with the information you provide. We encourage you to use caution when deciding to disclose<br>
  personal information. The user has both the capability, and the responsibility, to designate the<br>
  recipients of their mail, and the ability to set a deletion time period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Collection of Personal Information.</h3>
<p>
  For certain services you need a mailVU.com user account. When you register we request personal<br>
  information which may include your name, address, phone number, email address, username,<br>
  password, and other relevant information. We may record information about your usage of our site,<br>
  such as number of uploaded files and frequency and size of data transfers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A2Stream may collect non-personally identifying information provided by your browser as you use<br>
  the service. Information collected may include the IP Address, the time and date of your request, and<br>
  actions taken on the web site. Additional information may include browser type and version, Internet<br>
  connection type, webcam availability. We may assign your computer one or more cookies which may<br>
  collect information to facilitate access to our website and to personalize your online experience. We<br>
  may also use standard Internet tools, such as web beacons, which collect information that tracks your<br>
  use of our website and enables us to customize our services and advertisements. Information collected<br>
  by mailVU.com is used to operate the services, and to further develop and improve the service.</p>
<p>A2Stream may store your information in any country. By using the mailVU.com service you consent<br>
  that A2Stream may store, process, and transfer your personal information to any country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use of Personal Information</h3>

<p>We may, from time to time, send you emails regarding our services and products. Only mailVU.com<br>
  will send you these direct mailings, and only if you have not opted out. You may change your opt-out<br>
  preference at any time.</p>
<p>Testimonials posted on our web site are only placed with the expressed permission of the individual or<br>
  company who provided that testimonial.</p>
<p>We may use cookies, web beacons, and logging information to a) store information so you don't have<br>
  to retype it, b) provide custom, personalized content and information, c) monitor the effectiveness<br>
  of our marketing campaigns, d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and page<br>
  views, and e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</p>
<p>We may allow advertising companies or ad networks to display advertisements on our website. We<br>
  do not provide any personal information to these companies. Cookies and/or web beacons may be<br>
  placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of advertising campaigns<br>
  or email communications. You should visit those service provider's web pages to review their privacy<br>
  policies. We prohibit web beacons from being used by third parties to collect or access your personally<br>
  identifiable information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sharing Information with 3rd Parties</h3>
<p>
  We will not rent or sell your personal information to any other company or individual without your<br>
  consent, except as we are required by law, or if disclosure of information is necessary to protect<br>
  A2Stream, the mailVU.com users, or the general public. We reserve the right to report to law<br>
  enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
<p>You may provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us regarding third parties. For instance<br>
  when you share Private links with others you may provide and we collect the email addresses of the<br>
  people with whom you want to share your video and resume. We will not sell or rent Personally<br>
  Identifiable Information to others, nor disclose the information to others except to the extent necessary<br>
  to fulfill your service request, to protect ourselves from liability, to respond to a court order or<br>
  subpoena, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the company.</p>
<p>A2Stream may retain service providers to assist us with marketing, communications, and customer<br>
  service initiatives. These providers could include providers of customer support, email service<br>
  providers, automated data providers, and shipping agents. Suppliers and service providers are required<br>
  by contract to keep confidential the information received on behalf of A2Stream and may not use it for<br>
  any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for A2Stream.</p>
<p>Non account holders may view your mail if you designated them as recipients.</p>
<p>We do not store your credit card or other payment information on our site. Payment for services are<br>
  made through an online billing transaction partner.</p>
<p>We may share with third parties non-personal, aggregated information, such as demographic and<br>
  profile data of the user community at large.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Your Choice in Selecting Privacy Settings</h3>
<p>
  Every account holder is provided with a Profile section in their account. It is the responsibility of each<br>
  user to ensure the information is correct and current. Users are responsible for the accuracy of their<br>
  account profile. You may update or correct these selections as any time by logging into your account<br>
  and making the changes on the page. You may leave any optional information fields blank.</p>
<p>The user has the option to opt-out of mailVU.com notifications. This option does not apply to</p>
<p>communications primarily for the purpose of administering order completion, support, software<br>
  warnings and updates, or other administrative and transactional notices as the primary purpose of these<br>
  communications is not promotional in nature.</p>
<p>The user must specify the deletion time period of each multimedia mail. The files will be deleted from<br>
  the A2Stream servers at the earlier of the user defined date/views, or the time frame associated with<br>
  your account type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Access to and Accuracy of Your Information</h3>
<p>
  The mailVU.com site is generally accessible 24x7 every day of the year unless down for system<br>
  maintenance or an outage. To protect your privacy and security on Premium accounts, we will take<br>
  reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring username and password, before granting<br>
  access to the data. To view and modify your personal information you may edit the selections in the<br>
  Preferences page of the web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Keeping Your Personal information Secure</h3>
<p>
  A2Stream takes seriously the trust you place in us. We will keep your private data secure consistent<br>
  with current industry standards. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data<br>
  accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, A2Stream utilizes appropriate physical,<br>
  technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect.</p>
<p>Personal information, once transmitted to us, will be stored on computers that only selected personnel<br>
  and contractors have access to via password. These computer systems are located in controlled<br>
  facilities which have limited access. Your mail messages are limited-access, where access is gained<br>
  through an obscured URL system. This obscured URL makes it difficult if not impossible for a third<br>
  party to guess the URL address of your content without an invitation from you including the relevant<br>
  URL. However, unless the videos and content are password protected, your invitees may forward the<br>
  URL link to other parties and a possibility exists that an unauthorized third party could discover your<br>
  videos and/or content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
<p>
  We may occasionally update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When<br>
  we do, we will also revise the Update date located at the beginning of this Policy. We encourage you<br>
  to periodically review this Policy and become aware of modifications. If we make material changes in<br>
  the way we collect, use, or share your personal information, we will notify you for sending an email to<br>
  the email address you most recently provided to us and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes<br>
  on our website. Your continued use of the mailVU.com site constitutes your agreement to this Policy<br>
  and any updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
