    <!--<p>Effective date: 01/26/2012</p>-->
    <p>This privacy policy applies to your use of the services made available by Mailgun, Inc. (the “Services”), including the Mailgun platform (the “Platform”) and the website at mailgun.net (the “Site”), as of the effective date indicated above. It applies to information we collect before, on and after the effective date. In this document, “we” refers to Mailgun, Inc., and “you” refers to you, the user or customer to whom this policy applies. This policy should be read in conjunction with our <a class="reference external" href="/public/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    <p>In order to offer our Services to you, we must collect certain information about you. Because we respect your privacy, we have documented our policies regarding this information here, and we will not collect or use information about you except in the ways we describe.</p>
    <div class="section" id="what-information-we-collect">
    <h2>1. What information we collect<a class="headerlink" href="#what-information-we-collect" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
    <p>We collect two types of information about you: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-personally Identifiable Information.</p>
    <p><strong>“Personally Identifiable Information”</strong> is information that lets us know who you are, specifically. Information in this category includes the information you use when registering to use the Platform, like your name, email address, associated domain name and credit card information. Your login credentials are also Personally Identifiable Information. Finally, this category includes information tied to your identity that you provide us through other means, such as emails to our <a class="reference external" href="https://mailgun.net/support">support service</a> and comments on our <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.mailgun.net/">blog</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>“Non-personally Identifiable Information”</strong> is information that doesn’t let us determine your identity. This generally comes from your use of the Services after registering. For instance, our web server logs may show us that someone with a certain IP address visited the Site using a certain web browser, but we can’t use that information alone to say whether the visitor was you or someone else. Non-personally Identifiable Information also includes information that could personally identify you in its original form, but that we have modified to remove or hide (for instance, by aggregation) any Personally Identifiable Information. This collection of information occurs automatically when you use the Services.</p>
    <p>We also use web cookies and reserve the right to use web beacons (“Cookies”). These are small files associated with information that your browser or our servers will save and return as part of the Services for purposes such as saving your login session between visits, remembering your display preferences and tracking your use of the site. While Cookies do not contain Personally Identifiable Information, we may associate the information they contain with Personally Identifiable Information for these and similar purposes. You may opt out of our use of cookies by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.shtml">configuring your browser to reject them</a>. However, this may cause some features of the Services to work incorrectly.</p>
    <p>One kind of information we don’t collect is the content of the emails you send and receive with the Platform (unless you store emails in Mailboxes). We may scan your messages to ensure that they comply with our <a class="reference external" href="https://mailgun.net/public/terms">Terms of Service</a>, but once a message passes through the Platform’s servers we don’t record or archive its content (unless you store emails in Mailgun mailboxes), and we do not mine your messages for contextual advertising. While you should keep in mind that email, by its nature, is not a reliably private means of communication, <a class="reference external" href="http://documentation.mailgun.net/faqs.html#do-you-support-ssl-tls">we support TLS and SSL</a> to limit these risks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="how-we-use-your-information">
    <h2>2. How we use your information<a class="headerlink" href="#how-we-use-your-information" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect about you to provide the Services to you. As part of that purpose, we may use your Personally Identifiable Information and Non-personally Identifiable Information:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
    <li>to create and maintain your Platform account, and to control access to it;</li>
    <li>to provide you with real-time logs of your use of the Platform;</li>
    <li>to respond to any requests you may submit for support or sales information, or similar communications;</li>
    <li>to communicate with you (for example through newsletters, announcements or special offers) about the Services;</li>
    <li>for billing and collection purposes, if you have subscribed to one of our paid plans; and</li>
    <li>to help promote compliance with our Terms of Service or any other agreements between us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may use your Non-personally Identifiable Information to enhance the Services, for instance through web analytics or troubleshooting. We may also use aggregated or depersonalized information to promote our Services, such as by citing usage statistics.</p>
    <p>We may also use your information in the ways described above through a third-party contractor rather than in-house. If we do, we’ll require our contractors to protect your data on terms at least as strict as those in this policy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="third-parties">
    <h2>3. Third parties<a class="headerlink" href="#third-parties" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
    <p>Except for the limited circumstances described in this policy, we do not provide your information to third parties.</p>
    <p>We host the Site and operate the Platform using third parties, including <a class="reference external" href="http://www.softlayer.com/">SoftLayer®</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace®</a> (the “hosting providers”). For this reason, we will provide the information we collect to Hosting Providers, and the Hosting Providers will serve it from its data centers throughout the United States.</p>
    <p>We use a third party, <a class="reference external" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe®</a>, to process subscription payments, and therefore provide them with the Personally Identifiable Information required to charge your credit card.</p>
    <p>We may use third-party services either embedded into our Site (such as Tumblr®, Disqus®, Mixpanel™ and Google® Analytics) or outside of it (such as GitHub® and Twitter®) to communicate with you or to enhance the function of the Services. While we provide these third parties with no more information than is necessary to enable their use, any information that you provide these services independently is subject to their respective privacy policies and practices. We may in the future add additional third-party services or stop using some that we currently use, and we may not update this policy to reflect these changes.</p>
    <p>Finally, we may be required by law or court order to provide Personally Identifiable Information or Non-personally Identifiable Information to government authorities or private parties. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use the Services for illegal activities, and we may report to law enforcement any activities that we believe in good faith are unlawful.</p>

    <div class="section" id="your-choices">
    <h2>4. Your choices<a class="headerlink" href="#your-choices" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
    <p>You may opt out from any future communications from us (and/or our partners) by emailing us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support%40mailgunhq.com">support<span>@</span>mailgunhq<span>.</span>com</a>. We will honor your opt-out within 30 days. If you would like us to cease all of the described uses of your Personally Identifiable Information, you may delete your account at any time by emailing us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support%40mailgunhq.com">support<span>@</span>mailgunhq<span>.</span>com</a>. This will delete your Personally Identifiable Information from our records, and we will make no further use of it. We may, however, retain copies of your Personally Identifiable Information in backups.</p>
    <p>You may request a copy of any or all of your Personally Identifiable Information in our possession, and we will honor your request within 30 days. (If we must incur expenses to comply with your request, we may charge you a reasonable fee to cover these expenses if permitted by law.) If you believe any of the Personally Identifiable Information we have collected from you is inaccurate, you can email <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support%40mailgunhq.com">support<span>@</span>mailgunhq<span>.</span>com</a> with a request to update this information. We will honor your request within 30 days.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="security">
    <h2>5. Security<a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
    <p>We recognize how important your information is to you, so we maintain safeguards to protect it. We maintain a written internal security policy for our employees and restrict access to your Personally Identifiable Information to only those employees who need it. Our Hosting Providers, provide safeguards to protect your information as well: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.softlayer.com/legal/privacy">http://www.softlayer.com/legal/privacy</a>. Our third-party payment processor uses a number of <a class="reference external" href="https://stripe.com/help/security">security technologies</a> to safeguard your information. While we cannot guarantee that these measures will prevent every hacking attempt, we will notify you if we discover that the security of any of your Personally Identifiable Information has been materially breached.</p>
    <p>Remember, though, that some parts of the Services are public. If you voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information in our blog or another public area of the Site, unrelated parties online will be able to view it and collect it. If you don’t want to make this information publicly available, you shouldn’t post it.</p>

    <h2>6. Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#standards" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
