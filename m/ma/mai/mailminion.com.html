To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Mail Minion's certification, please visit <u>http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what we do - and, more importantly, don't do - with any information you provide us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>"I Am An Mail Minion Affiliate."</strong></p>
<p>Your name, address, phone and fax number, email address, tax ID number or SSN and any other information you provide are held in strict confidence. We collect this information only so we can generate your commission checks and so we can meet United States federal tax requirements.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>What About Clear Gifs?</strong></p>
<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>We use other third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for services and a Live Chat service to assist you if you have questions while using our site or regarding your order. When you sign up for our services we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
<p>In the event Mail Minion goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Access To Personal Information</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>The security of your personal information and our clients' information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and credit card information) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
