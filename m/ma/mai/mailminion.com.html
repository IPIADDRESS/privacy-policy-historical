        <strong><u>Mail Minion Privacy Policy</u></strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
At Mail Minion Limited ("<strong>Mail Minion</strong>"), we respect your privacy and take protecting it seriously. This Privacy Policy covers our collection, use and disclosure of information we collect through our website and service <a href="http://www.mailminion.com">www.mailminion.com</a> . The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged Mail Minion.<br>
&nbsp;<br><strong><u>Information We Collect</u></strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
When you register to use the service, communicate with our customer service team, send us an email, or post on our blog, you’re giving us information that we collect. That information may include your IP address, name, physical address, email address, phone number, credit card information, and other details like gender, occupation, and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, and stored by us, only as described in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When you add an email distribution list or create an email with the service, we have access to the data on your list and the information in your email. We may get information about how and when you use the service. This information may include your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions taken by you within the application.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our site may use "cookies" to enhance the subscriber's experience. The subscriber's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about the subscriber. The subscriber may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the site may not function properly.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When we send emails to registered Mail Minion customers, we'll sometimes track who opened the emails and who clicked the links. We do that to measure our performance and to improve our features for specific segments of customers. To do this, we include web beacons in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create the reports you see about who has or hasn’t opened emails or clicked links. Reports are also available to us when we send you email, so we may collect and review that information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We may get more information about you, like name, age, and participation in social media websites, by searching the internet or querying third parties. We only collect data that’s publicly available or provided by a third party according to its terms of use.<br>
&nbsp;<br><strong><u>Public Information and Third Parties</u></strong><br>

&nbsp;<br>
We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our site.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Sensitive and private data exchange between the site and its users happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.<br>

We do not sell, trade, or rent users personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and subscribers with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our operators and compliance personnel may need to review email communications sent by any member, whether or not they are addressed to us, if we become aware of possible breaches of the Terms of Service, including sending spam.
