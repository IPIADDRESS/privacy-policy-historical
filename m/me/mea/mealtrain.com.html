        <li>your choices about such uses and disclosures</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our website or services or transacting business with us. By using our website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

    </p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>mealTrain.com ("Site") offers a service that allows for the creation of a community meal coordination service (a "mealTrain") for a recipient, sending invitations to friends, receiving invitations, booking dates for meal delivery, researching Meal Train planning ideas, and researching etiquette tips and tools, (herein referred to as the "Service" or "Meal Train Service").</p>

    <h3>Information we collect about you</h3> 
    <p>We may collect personal information that can identify you, such as your name and email address and other information that you provide to us. We may also collect information that does not identify you. When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.</p> 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Information you provide.</b> We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, email address, image, telephone number, ZIP code, gender, age and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). </li>
        <li><b>Information from other sources.</b> We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information (updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information) about you from business partners, contractors, and other third parties and add it to your account information or other information we have collected. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Your choices about collection and use of your information</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>New Users</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Registered Users</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>While Meal Train does not give you the opportunity to remove your information from our database, you may remove your registration information from your My Profile page. In addition, at any time you can choose to no longer;
            <ul>
                <li>receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters</li>
                <li>receive mobile alerts</li> 
                <li>receive internal reminders, booking confirmation, or cancellation notice emails</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Account Changes
            <ul>
                <li><b>Profile Changes</b> (except for account closure) may be done at any time through mealTrain.com. Click on the "My Profile" link, and change the desired information.</li>  
                <li><b>Account Closure:</b> If you have an online profile with us, you may choose to close your account at any time by submitting a request via the "Contact Us" link on the home page of the Meal Train website. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website, access any of your personal information, and all future events that you have created or scheduled will be cancelled.  You can open a new account at any time.
                    <ul><li>If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and record keeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our Terms of Service, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our web site or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third partiesâ€™ policies.</li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them</li>
        <li>Please note that changing information in your profile, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h4>Removing personal information from a specific mealTrain</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Delete your name from an invitation list:</b> You may delete your name from the invitation list by requesting to be removed from the invitee list on the invitation page. Once your name is removed from the invitation list, it will no longer be accessible to other invitees (unless you are subsequently re-invited to participate in the mealTrain by the organizer or the recipient).  You must individually remove your name from each mealTrain you do not wish to participate in.</li>
        <li><b>Cancel a mealTrain:</b> You, or the organizer can cancel a previously created mealTrain by logging into your account and proceeding to the "My Meal Trains" tab and selecting the "Cancel this mealTrain" function.  All affected Meal Train users will be notified. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Unregistered Users</h4>

You may also utilize the "Contact Us" page on the mealtrain.com home page to request a specific mealTrain be cancelled.

We use invitees' contact information to allow them to view, respond to, and comment on your Meal Train invitation.</p> 

    <p>We may send reminders to invitees, other mealTrain related information, and we may display their email addresses or names to other invitees of the same mealTrain.
