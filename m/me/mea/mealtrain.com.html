<h4>Sharing within Mealtrain.com</h4>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Website.</p>

<p><strong>Meal Train Calendar Creation:</strong></p>
<p>To create a Meal Train Calendar, you must provide the Meal Train Recipient’s name, email, city, state, and zip code. If the recipient does not have an email address, you can list the organizer’s email as the recipient. Providing the street address is optional. In addition, the organizer must be a registered user and have agreed to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Providing additional personal information including dates available to receive meals, meal preferences, nature of the meal train, photos, and updates is completely optional. The sharing of all provided information is specified as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Invitations and Inclusion on the Participant list:</strong></p>
<p>All participants to a meal train must be invited by the recipient, organizer, or other participants on a meal train. Meal Train LLC will not provide the unique URL upon participant request. Upon being invited, a user can view the Meal Train Calendar, view recipient city, state, and zip code, view any optionally provided information, read Updates, view photos, participate in a Donation Fund (when active), or send a gift card without creating a user account.</p>
<p>If you are invited from within mealtrain.com, book a date, make a donation, or become a registered user, your email will be added to the Participant list for that Meal Train. Nonregistered users will have a truncated version of their email address added to the participant list.  Registered users have their First and Last Name displayed.</p>
<p>Inclusion on the participant list enables you to receive updates from the organizer or recipient and receive direct email messages from the organizer, recipient, or other participants.  Both registered and non-registered users can manage their communication preferences by clicking on the link at the bottom of most meal train generated emails.</p>

<p><strong>Date Booking:</strong></p>
<p>To book a date, you must be registered user by providing Meal Train your First and Last Name, an email address and agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We will provide you with the ability to select email reminder preferences during the date booking as well as Meal Train specific communication preferences in each email.</p>
<p>If the organizer or recipient books a date on behalf of a registered or non-registered user, the date will display the First and Last name of the other user, the user will be added to the Participant list, and the organizer and recipient can opt for the specific reminder emails.</p>

<p><strong>Donation Fund:</strong></p>
<p>As an Organizer or Recipient of a Meal Train, you may choose to activate the Donation Fund feature.  The Donation Fund feature is optional.  Activating the Donation Fund feature requires that we send your name, email address, and IP address to WePay.com, our payment partner.  WePay will use that information to create a WePay account for you.   You are required to verify the WePay account after it is created and accept WePay’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.  You may choose to decline the account verification.  WePay accounts that are not verified are automatically deleted in a timeframe defined by WePay.  You can learn more about WePay’s privacy policy by clicking here. (<a href="https://go.wepay.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://go.wepay.com/privacy-policy</a>)</p>
<p>You can participate in a Donation Fund without being a registered user.  Upon donating, your name will be displayed on the Meal Train Donation Fund tab (unless marked anonymous) and your email address will be added to the Participant list for that specific Meal Train. A truncated version of your email address will be added to the participant list (unless you are a registered user in which case your First and Last Name will be displayed).  Meal Train LLC does not directly collect financial information related to the donation process. All donations are handled by WePay.com and use of the donation feature requires acceptance of their Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. (<a href="https://go.wepay.com/terms-of-service" target="_blank">https://go.wepay.com/terms-of-service</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Gift Cards:</strong></p>
<p>You can participate in sending a gift card to the recipient without being a registered user.  Any links to gift cards on Meal Train direct the user to partner sites where gift cards can be purchased.  Gift cards are not sold by Meal Train LLC.</p>

<p><strong>Emailing Other Participants:</strong></p>
<p>You must be a registered user to email other participants.  General participants are not able to view email addresses of other general participants.  Participants on a specific Meal Train may choose to email other participants through mealtrain.com pertaining to the Meal Train. Should a user opt to directly reply to that email from their email client, their email will become visible to the first sender.</p>
