              Frequent visitors to our community area may optionally have our

              to this information on to the users' computer in a "cookie" file 
              (a text file that allows web sites to store and read information 
              on your computer relevant to your web accounts). MHN does not place 
              any <u> personally</u> identifying information into this cookie 
              file. Your Mental Help Net User ID automatically identifies your 
              computer -- but not you -- to our servers when you visit our site. 
              Unless you specifically tell us, Mental Help Net will never know 
              who you are, even though we assign your computer a cookie. Cookie 
              use is completely optional. 
            </p><p><b>b) Third Party Cookies Embedded In Ad Banners</b><br>
              Advertising on MHN helps us to bring our services to you at absolutely 
              no cost. The price of this free service is that companies placing 
              ad banners on our site have the ability to assign your computer 
              a cookie that uniquely identifies your computer. The ad cookies 
              identify your computer and not your personal identity. The banner 
              cookies are used by the ad companies to keep track of which ad banners 
              you click on. The ad companies are interested in building up a profile 
              of what you purchase so that they can send you ads that you are 
              likely to be interested in when you visit in the future. MHN does 
              not share any information with the ad companies that would allow 
              them to link your personal identity to the cookie ID number they 
              may have assigned you.

            <p>MHN uses the information we gather from you for several purposes:<br>
            </p><p>a) We analyze what our customers like and don't like about Mental 
              Health Net's current offerings so that we can design better services. 
            </p><p>b) MHN does not engage in profiling (e.g., matching your computer 
              with your interests). However, our network ad server FlyCast may 
              use profiling 
            </p><p>c) We develop summary -- not individual -- reports for our advertisers. 
              An example of a summary report might be "200 people clicked on your 
              advertisement "X" today." Advertisers use this information to track 
              the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. We never tell our advertisers 
              who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements. 
            </p><p>d) The community registration information is used in several ways. 
              First, registration serves as a means of allowing you to be uniquely 
              identified, so that users can keep track of who said what. Second, 
              you may optionally have our forum software place your email address 
              into messages you send so that people can mail you personally in 
              response. Third, we use the registration information to identify 
              and communicate with persons who post inappropriate messages in 
              the forums and chats. The registration also serves as a means of 
              blocking known abusive users from entering the community. 
            </p><p>e) Subscribers to our newsletter receive twice monthly email newsletters 
              including information about new products and services from Mental 
              Health Net. Mental Help Net uses the services of Postmaster General 
              (A third party list-server company) to help with the mailing of 
              our newsletter. Your email address is stored on the Postmaster General 
              computer (and not on MHN's computer). Postmaster General's privacy 
              policy protects the privacy and security of your email address. 
            </p><p>f) MHN clinicians can post yellowpages listings, resumes and jobs 
              to our databases. This information is made available to the public 
              for searching.

              MHN works with cPulse to survey our readership on the

              it out if you don't want to. The information gathered becomes the
