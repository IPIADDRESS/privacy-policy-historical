    list used by other companies to promote appropriate products and services. Our customer

    service operations as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, Rodale Press mailings prepared several months in advance may include a
    customer's name, even after a customer has asked to be removed from our mailing lists. As
    a result, the customer may receive mail from Rodale Press within one or two months after
    the request. We apologize for this inconvenience, and we will make sure that mailing lists

    intended use of such information upon request.</p>
    <p><b>Who has access to customer information?<br>
    </b>Rodale Press will limit access to reader information on a "need to know"

    stringent security measures to safeguard information about our customers. </p>
    <p><b>In what ways will Rodale Press share customer information?<br>
    </b>Sometimes, Rodale Press makes its list of customer names and addresses available to
    carefully screened organizations. Outside of these organizations, Rodale Press will not
    disclose any information unless required to do so by law or other regulatory authority.</p>
    <p><b><font size="4">WE BELIEVE in the three rules of good communication -- <i>accuracy,
    accuracy, and accuracy!<br>
    </i></font></b>Rodale Press will employ rigorous safeguards -- both in technology and in
    employee practices -- to ensure the highest possible standards of accuracy, completeness
    and timeliness of all information about our customers. In addition, we will seek assurance
    of information quality from other list sources.</p>
