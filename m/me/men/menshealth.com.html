<br>


<br>

We're a family-run business that treats its customers like family. And we are deeply committed to protecting your privacy and security when you access Rodale owned and operated Web sites. 
<br>


<br>

We believe you have the right to know everything regarding the information we collect about you as you use Rodale owned and operated Web sites...how this information benefits you...and how you can say "no" to the use of any of this information. 
<br>


<br>

This policy explains what we do with your information online, and what you can expect from Rodale. By using this site, you indicate your acceptance of Rodale's Online Privacy Policy. 
<br>


<br>

<b>Children Under 13:</b>
<br>

We care about the safety of children. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved in your children's online experience, and to share your interest in our sites with your young ones.
<br>


<br>

<b>What information do you collect about me?</b>
<br>

Rodale collects personal identifying information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. We also collect user-specific information on what pages are visited and volunteered information such as survey information and/or site registrations. 
<br>


<br>

<b>What's in it for me?</b>
<br>

<i>Plenty!</i> The information we collect allows us to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each visitor. Plus, it enables us to notify visitors about updates to our Web site...contact visitors with special offers of interest...and customize our visitors' Web site experience. In addition, information is shared with reputable organizations who may contact Web site visitors with special offers of possible interest. 
<br>


<br>

<b>What are "cookies" and what do they do for me?</b>
<br>

In order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, Rodale may use cookies to store visitors' preferences and information about such things as items added to a user's shopping cart, what pages users visit, and past user activity at a site. "Cookies" are tiny pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are also used to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, to customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type (Netscape or Microsoft Explorer, for example) or other information that the visitor sends. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. 
<br>


<br>

If you want to disable cookies, there is a simple procedure in most Internet browsers that allow you to turn off cookies. Please remember however, that cookies may be required to allow you to use certain features of our sites. 
<br>


<br>

<b>With whom do you share information about me?</b>
<br>

From time to time, we make our customer e-mail addresses, postal addresses and telephone numbers available to other reputable business associates whose products or services might be of value to you.

<b>Transfers of Information for Legal Purposes</b>
<br>

Rodale, Inc. may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request. If there is a change of control in Rodale's business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), or a sale or transfer of its assets, customer information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your personally identifying information potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said customer information. 
<br>


<br>

<b>Links </b>
<br>

Rodale sites may, on occasion, contain links to other sites with information gathering practices different from our own.  Visitors should consult privacy policies for all other sites as Rodale has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third parties.
<br>


<br>

Rodale sites sometimes offer contest, sweepstakes or promotions sponsored or co-sponsored by third parties.  These third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes or promotion.  Rodale has no control over the third party sponsor's use of this information.  The Rodale site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if third party sponsors will obtain such information.
