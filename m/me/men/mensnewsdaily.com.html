You'">Amy Alkon on MND / \"Everything Happens For A Reason\"?</a></span> - AmusedMuse - Squiggy: "Christian Dominionists" refers to Rousas John Rushdoony  ("Reconstruction"), his Chalcedon Foundation, and his followers such as those in the Intelligent Design movement who have received funding from such characters, not to Christians in general. You're just playing dumb. Don't try to be innocent and smart at the same time - pick one, please.      I could show instances of former Islamic fanatics who became secular. Despite their not being Christians, you think you don't prefer them after their transformation? We both know that you would. Don't patronize me if you don't know what "dominionism" is. Of course atheism helps some people.      Actually, I believe that prayer can do a world of good to the person that is praying, in the same way that positive thinking does. (For example, go to my blog and read my latest post.) But don't change the subject, the article was about prayer for other people - amputees, specifically.  Your argument is a non sequitur, because it does not answer the question - at what point does prayer "work" and not. You simply gave me anecdotal "evidence" after the fact of prayer "working." Nostradamus is a prophet if you argue after the fact. Before I pray, tell me please, in what situations will it "work" and not? (Hint: amputees.)      I hate to break this to you, but the Second Law of Thermodynamics does not mention entropy (except on creationist websites). Here it is: "No process is possible in which the sole result is the transfer of energy from a cooler to a hotter body." (Oh, sorry, were you aware that you should have referred to the Second Law, not the "laws of thermodynamics"? Bad move.)      "In God We Trust" is not on my debit card, is it? I couldn't care less about that phrase being on our quaint paper money few people use anymore. (Yeah, think about that.) Liberals? Liberals are open-minded. Thank you. (Hello, you can be politically conservative and "liberal" at the same time - and don't assume I'm politically conservative.) "Delicate sensibilities?" Do you even know what you're talking about?  Many names I have been called - a shrinking violent not one of them.    I suppose you'll consider me to be the "no" answer to a prayer. Hey, I didn't make the rules.

Entropy is entropy, and everything follows the law of entropy (even in a so-called "open system").  In a nutshell, Entropy states that ââ¦the law of increasing entropy is a universal law of decreasing complexity, whereas evolution is supposed to be a universal law of increasing complexity.â   Not once has any person of âReasonâ been able to observe through the natural environment something change from something less complex to something more complex.

Kristine  said: <i>If you want us atheists to "grow up," then please articulate a coherent answer to the deeper question that Alkon is asking: how, in the absence of evidence, should we know when prayer "works" and doesn't "work"?</i>    I can give you many instances where becoming a Christian has totally changed self-destructive behavior.  Where salvation has completely changed peoples' lives for the better <i> (I won't ask you to show me where becoming an atheist has changed anyone's lives for the better - we both know that doesn't happen)</i>.  Is that proof of the power of prayer?  Not to you.    I doubt anything I can say to you would convince you.  For instance, I pray that I make good decisions with my investments, and I mostly do (I'm up about 40% for the year).  Do I always get it right?  Not by a long shot.  This proves what?  To you, nothing.  To me, it means I don't always listen well enough.  Plus there's one other detail - sometimes the answer to a prayer might be "no".    As for "Christian dominionists movement" (I just love your loving, tolerant terms for people you disagree with), why shouldn't our side be allowed the same rights as your side?  You force evolution "education" on our children (completely ignoring simple questions like the violations of the laws of thermodynamics) and claim the moral high ground.  We vehemently disagree with you, yet we're still supposed to keep our mouths shut.  Justify this for me.    We aren't trying to force anything down your throat (and you know this) and yet you have no problem doing just that.  No one is trying to "convert" you.  If you want to hear, I will gladly explain the concept of salvation (i.e. forgiveness for all of your defects).  But no one is going to make you do anything.    By the way - saying "In God we trust" on the money harms you how?  I'm sorry if your "delicate sensibilities" are hurt, but if that causes you big problems, then you REALLY have a lot of growing up to do.    P.S.  Men's News Daily is a conservative website.  The vast majority of conservatives believe in God.  And we don't have chips on our shoulders, like all atheists seemingly do.  Please lose the anger - it's not becoming and it doesn't help your argument.  It just makes you sound like liberals. </li><li><span class="rssLinkListItemTitle"><a href="http://mensnewsdaily.com/sexandmetro/2009/07/23/believe-her-the-woman-never-lies-myth/#IDComment29453127" title="Cory - Why do black men hate black women?

So please spare us the worn out "how do you know" argument, one that you don't even believe. (No one does.) It is embarrassing to see theists attempt to speak for nontheists. It reminds me of women claiming that men, deep down, really want to go to the ceramic figurines show at the local mall. You don't see any posts trying to disprove the Tooth Fairy, Squiggy? The last time I checked, there wasn't a Christian Dominionist movement with deep pockets funding efforts to get the Tooth Fairy taught in public schools. I don't see many posts from conservatives cleaning their own house of the creationist hogwash and "birther" nonsense that is destroying whatever is left of its intellectual wing.

Attempting to use the language of science in order to convince us that science is no better than religion. This argument is fundamentally flawed and tries to argue that the only thing that is real is actually fantasy.  Good thing so many believe in the Polio vaccine, otherwise we would still have this wonderful disease that god supposedly created with us.   2. Projection - this is by far the most common in thetactic used in an attempt to derail a debate among conservative Christians today. Worked great for the last administration - for a while. Accuse your opponent of doing what you do. It's what you do when you have no defense and are desperate for something to grab on to. I hate to break this to you Squiggy, but you are looking at yourself in the mirror.  As for maturity, knowing yourself well enough to realize when someone is pulling your leg is wisdom. We are taught to believe in ghosts as children and hopefully we grow out of it. Non believers have to put up with endless reminders of religion on our money, on our tax funded buildings, oaths and discrimination from employers anon anon - we will stop ridiculing and complaining when you all stop proselytizing and lying to people for money.   Finally, arguments are won by proving things, not by disproving them. I could literally waste your time by pulling anything out of my ass and requiring you to prove it isn't so - or alternatively, convincing you to join a bible study group.  The facts are that prayer has not been shown to be effective. it may make you feel better, but that's all.      </li>				</ul>

<p>This week we look at the struggle for family law reform in Canada, the home of some of the worldâs most extreme anti-male anti-father legislation. Recently Dads On The Air interviewed Canadian MP Maurice Vellacot, who has introduced shared parenting legislation into the Canadian parliament.

<p>Over the past week fatherâs activists around Australia have been appalled by announcements from the Australian Labor government that it intends winding back the 2006 reforms to family law which promoted more cooperative arrangements after divorce or separation. <br> <br> The government is conduction three separate inquiries into family law, inappropriately linking the inquiries with domestic violence. Not one of them consults the views of fathers or even the general public. There could be no clearer case of the mandarins regarding the great unwashed with contempt and not trusting their opinions, because after all there is strong public support for shared parenting.</p>
<p>Against this background, this week we play samples from the compelling podcasts compiled by a private practicing psychologist with 25 years experience who is driven by his own experiences and the experiences of many of his clients.

<p>This week we range across a wide variety of subjects, talking first up with the ever lively author of a new book on becoming a dad, <em>Be My Baby</em><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Humphreys"> <strong>Neil Humphreys</strong></a>. From the cheery to the rational, we then talk with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mensrights.com.au/"><strong>Sue Price</strong></a>, the founder of the <em>Menâs Rights Agency</em>, arguably the most articulate supporter, of the rights of men in our modern society.</p>
<p>This is followed by a fascinating interview with academic<strong> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.menshealthaustralia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=234&amp;Itemid=91">Dr. Michael Woods</a></strong>&nbsp; <em>UWS</em>, as we take a revealing look at the way the real statistics on Domestic Violence and Child Abuse have been kept from the general public, and how many Government Policies appear to be formulated based on inaccurate information.</p>
<p>We close the show talking with <strong>Benjamin Easton</strong> a <em>Political Busker</em>, who is participating in a demonstration outside the Bank of New Zealand, protesting their outrageous portrayal of all men as bashers and all women as victims, clearly themselves the victims of domestic violence hysteria. Somewhere along the line they forgot that half their customers are male and most of them object to being portrayed as Neanderthals.</p><p><strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dadsontheair.net/storage/shows/Dads_on_the_Air_2009-07-21.mp3">Listen Now (MP3)</a></strong></p><div class="feedflare">

<p class="p1">First up we talk with <b>Jeff Kennett</b>, former Victorian Premier from 1992 to 1999, a man always admired for his outspoken directness. He began the National Depression Initiative <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.beyondblue.org.au/index.aspx?"><span class="s1"><b>Beyond Blue</b></span></a> after the death of two of his daughterâs acquaintances. As Premier at that time he was shocked when it was revealed that both the deaths in question were actually as a result of suicidal intent. That started his investigation into what was being done and his involvement in the development of Beyond Blue.</p>
<p class="p1">Beyond Blueâs mission is âto provide a national focus and community leadership to increase the capacity of the broader Australian community to prevent depression and respond effectively to it. The aim is to build a society that understands and responds to the personal and social impact of depression, works actively to prevent it and improves the quality of life for everyone affected by it. The steps they have taken are to raise awareness of the problem, to de-stigmatize depression and mental illness in general, to conduct research into the problems of depression and impacts on our society, and to advocate for better government and corporate policies to accommodate and support sufferers of mental illness.â</p>

<p>With moves clearly afoot to wind back the modest reforms of the previous government on shared parenting legislation designed to encourage a relationship between both parents and children after separation, we take a look at the very strong case for shared parenting as the norm post-separation, with advocates arguing it works best for both children and parents - as well as saving the government a great deal of money by encouraging single parents to get off welfare and into work. <br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mauricevellacott.ca/"><strong>Maurice Vellacott</strong></a> is a <strong>Canadian Member of Parliament</strong> who has just introduced a bill promoting shared parenting into the Canadian legislature. He says a recent poll demonstrated that 78% of Canadians support equal shared parenting, with slightly more women than men supporting co-operative care of children post divorce.<br> <br> Surveys in Australia have shown similar high levels of support, with the main obstruction to the commonsense notion coming from government bureaucrats and the family law industry itself. Regular guest <strong>Sue Price</strong> from the unfashionably named <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mensrights.com.au/"><strong>Menâs Rights Agency</strong></a> will talk about the devastating impacts on individuals and the broader community of the sole-mother custody model which has done so much harm over recent decades. She dismisses the current spirited campaign by feminist lobby groups outside Family Courts as nothing but hysterical male bashing by people with absolutely no knowledge of family law. <br> <br> We close the show with an extended interview with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.michaelgreenmediation.com"><strong>Michael Green QC</strong></a>, author of the book <em>Shared Parenting</em>, who is also alarmed at the current moves to unwind shared parenting legislation. He argues that with legislation in many jurisdictions now enshrining shared parental responsibility and parenting time, there is ample research which indicates how important it is for children to continue meaningful relationships after family breakdown.</p>

</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong>Barbara Biggs</strong> has become the new âposter girlâ for the anti-shared parenting movement. While many fathers have been disturbed by her comments in the media against shared and co-operative parenting after divorce, this is the first opportunity for many to hear what she has to say directly. Barbara Biggs spoke at a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fortaustralia.com/"><span class="s2"><strong>Fellowship of the Roundtable</strong></span></a> forum at NSW Parliament House with the subject <em>Family Law - Is The Man The Loser?</em> This is the speech she gave followed by her answers to questions from the floor. Family law reformers around the country have been alarmed at the scurillous campaign, including a number of demonstrations outside family courts and other locations, to return family law to the dark ages when more than half of all children entering the Family Court arena rarely if ever saw their fathers again and almost no fathers were ever given any substantial time with their children.</p>
<p class="p1">The campaign is being conducted under the guise of preventing domestic violence against women and sexual abuse against children. Biggs claims that the shared parenting laws have forced children to spend time with abusive parents, but her target is clearly fathers. One simple point reformers make: child abuse is committed by both genders, it is a crime, and is a police matter, but Biggs only focuses on sexual abuse of children ignoring child homicide, infanticide, neglect, emotional and physical abuse where women make up the majority of perpetrators. Most sexual abuse of children occurs at the hands of other siblings, step parents, motherâs boyfriends/defactos and other relatives. Fathers are the least likely to sexually abuse their children.</p>
<p class="p1">For the vast majority of family law cases, the research is clear:&nbsp;children benefit from a continued relationship with both parents after separation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbara Biggs has made a career out of her colourful life, including alleging she was sold as a sex slave by her grandmother at 14 as well doing stints as a prostitute, mental health patient and property developer. Her books include <em>In Moral Danger, The Journey Home, The Accidental Renovator</em> and <em>Money and Sex: How To Get More</em>. Whether Biggs is a dangerous hysteric promoting irrational hatred against men or a true champion of the nationâs abused children, you can decide for yourself.</p>

<p class="p1">Dads on the Air was pleased to accept an invitation from the debating group <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fortaustralia.com/"><span class="s1"><strong>Fellowship of the Round Table</strong></span></a>. We were asked to contribute to their debate called <em>Family Law: Is the Man The Loser?</em> We argue men, women and children are all losers under the present system. With the current left-wing Labor government preparing to wind back the modest family law reforms of the previous conservative Howard government which encouraged shared and cooperative care of children after divorce or separation, there could hardly be a more controversial subject in Australia today. Prior to the reforms more than half of the countryâs dads barely if ever saw their children again after divorce. With the enormous pain this was causing parents, and the enormous damage the destruction of the relationship between children and their fathers was doing to the kids and to society at large, these reforms were long overdue. This week we play a fascinating speech from senior family law lawyer <strong>Mark Yousseff</strong> as well as speeches from DOTA representative <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.justisrecords.com.au/"><span class="s1"><strong>Peter van de Voorde</strong></span></a> and <strong>Warwick Marsh</strong> from the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fathersonline.org/"><span class="s1"><strong>Fatherhood Foundation</strong></span></a>.</p>
