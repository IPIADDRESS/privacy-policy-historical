<span class="a_body1">Menulog&nbsp;is committed to ensuring the privacy and security of all information collected from our users. In accordance with the privacy legislation applicable in Australia, this Privacy Policy outlines the information collection practices utilised by Menulog, how that information is used and the choices you can make about the way the information you provide to us is collected and used. <br><br> 
<p><span class="a_head3"><strong>The information we collect</strong></span><br>When You lodge a booking, place a takeaway order, purchase a restaurant voucher or rate/review a restaurant via the&nbsp;Menulog web site, we need to collect information about You in order to enable us to deliver our service. This information includes, but is not limited to, details such as your name, your contact details, your payment details, your delivery address,&nbsp;your requirements and relevant booking information. <br><br><span class="a_head3"><strong>How we use the information</strong></span><br>If You decide to complete an on-line form, the information that you enter into the on-line form will be collected and saved by us. The information You supply to us is used to assess your requirements and to enable the relevant restaurant or takeaway delivery partner&nbsp;to contact You in response to your enquiry. </p>
We may disclose your information to various third parties for the following purposes: 
<ul class="a_item1">
    <li class="a_item1">to send You marketing material for goods or services we think might interest You (whether or not related to your application) </li>
    <li class="a_item1">for administration purposes (including but not limited to processing your home delivery order or restaurant booking)<br></li>
    <li class="a_item1">for such other purposes as we shall in our discretion determine, including for our commercial advantage </li>
</ul><br>
<p>It is a condition of your use of the&nbsp;Menulog website that you agree to allow your data to be disclosed to these third parties and for them to establish contact with you. If at any point in time you would like your saved data to be deleted from our system, please contact us and we will arrange to have your records deleted from our database. <br><br>As a user of our service, You may occasionally receive email or SMS updates from us about new products or services being offered by Menulog, along with newsletters, noteworthy changes to the website and any other material we deem relevant. You can always unsubscribe and opt out from receiving these messages. <br><br>Unless otherwise prohibited by law or our contractual obligations, we may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, court order, or as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. Such situations may include: to perform, maintain or enforce contracts with our users or suppliers; to protect the rights or properties of Menulog, our business affiliates, our users, or others; or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing, or who may be threatening to cause, interference with or damage to our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise; or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. <br><br>Like most websites, there is certain information we automatically track, including the URL that You just came from, the browser You are using and your IP address. This data is utilised to improve the services of&nbsp;Menulog and does not include any personally identifying information.<br><br><strong>Our commitment to data security</strong><br>All user details captured by Menulog are stored securely at all times and will never be provided to any unauthorised third parties. While being transmitted over the Internet, all credit card details are protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. Menulog has been verified for security and compliance to SSL standards by Comodo, an independent third party. Credit card details are handled by a 3rd party Payment Gateway called Direct Payment Solutions(DPS), a leading PCI Compliant Provider of secure credit card processing solutions. Menulog will never save your actual credit card details. We will simply save a reference to your card, which is called a token.&nbsp; This token is provided to us by our Payment Gateway.&nbsp; Saving the token means that for future credit card transactions we can give you the option to&nbsp; charge the same card you used previously without having to re-enter the card details. You will still need to enter your Menulog password to use this credit card. If, at any time, you wish the token to be removed please email us at enquiries@menulog.com and we will have these removed.&nbsp; In that case you would need to re-enter your card details on the next order.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, Menulog will not in any circumstances be liable to You, or third parties, for loss or damage arising from credit card fraud or identity theft.<br><br><span class="a_head3"><strong>Cookies</strong></span><br>We may, from time to time, use "cookies" to store your preferences, record session information and collect information on how You visit and access our Web pages.
