		<h3 class="underlined">MENDELEY PRINCIPLES</h3>

		<p>Our mission is to help you manage and share your research data. Besides the data which you openly disclose on our website (e.g. public profile information, comments in public discussions), you can also back up your research library to your individual account on Mendeley Web. When you do so, this means that information about the articles on your computer  will be stored on our servers. We understand that this data contains private and confidential information, and we will do everything to preserve this privacy.</p>

		<p>In treating your data, Mendeley follows three core principles:<br><br>
			<b>1. No data is uploaded without your knowledge.</b><br>
			Data is only uploaded to your account when you explicitly choose to do so after being asked by the Mendeley Desktop software.
			<br><br>
			<b>2. You decide which data to share, and with whom.</b><br>
			Mendeley will never publish private or personally identifiable data. No one will ever see the contents of your research library, and no one will ever know what you are currently researching or reading, unless you explicitly decide to share this data with other researchers. In addition, it is your decision whether to share this data with selected colleagues only, or with the entire Mendeley community.
			<br><br>
			<b>3. Your data and your content is owned by you.</b><br>
			Whatever data and content you upload to your Mendeley account is owned by you. We do not claim any ownership rights. Of course, you can delete your data at any time.
		</p>

		<p>From all the users' individual accounts, we <em>anonymously</em> aggregate metadata and statistics, some of which will be made available to the Mendeley community. Nothing about you personally can be inferred from the aggregated statistics. One example: The Mendeley community will be able to see that a certain paper had 7,153 readers and was the most popular paper in Biology last week. However, nobody except you will know whether you were one of these 7,153 readers.</p>

		<p>We believe that aggregating the data in this way benefits both you and the community at large, because it</p>

		<ul class="beta">
			<li class="mendeley_features" style="padding-bottom:0px;">improves the automatic document recognition in Mendeley Desktop (see <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/faq/#automatic-metadata-extraction" class="red" title="Automatic Metadata Extraction">Automatic Metadata Extraction</a>),</li>
			<li class="mendeley_features" style="padding-bottom:0px;">allows you unprecedented insights into the statistics and research trends of your academic discipline,</li>
			<li class="mendeley_features" style="padding-bottom:0px;">allows you unprecedented insights into the statistics and research trends of your academic discipline,</li>
			<li class="mendeley_features" style="padding-bottom:0px;">gives you a better understanding of your own research habits and document collection,</li>
			<li class="mendeley_features" style="padding-bottom:0px;">lays the data foundation for a sophisticated research paper recommendation engine,</li>
			<li class="mendeley_features" style="padding-bottom:0px;">lets you evaluate your impact on the research community,</li>

			We hope you find these principles useful, understandable, and acceptable. For the full-length "legal language" version, please have a look at our Privacy Policy below. If you have questions, ideas, or concerns, please send them to <script type="text/javascript">

		<h3 class="underlined">PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

		<p>Mendeley Limited is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.<br><br>

			This policy (together with our <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/terms" class="red" title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a> and any other documents referred to in it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.<br><br>

			For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the "Act"), the data controller is Mendeley Limited of Second Floor, Cardiff House, Tilling Road, London NW2 1LJ ("we", "us" or "our").  We are registered under the Act under number Z1344315.

		<h3 class="underlined">OUR SOFTWARE</h3>

		<p>If you choose to download the Mendeley software ("our software"), it will monitor (even if you are not online) the articles and papers you catalogue, access, read and manage using our software. If you give your explicit consent, the information concerning your reading actions is sent to our servers for the purpose of:</p>
		<ul class="beta">
			<li class="mendeley_features" style="padding-bottom:0px;">generating recommendations for you including articles that you may be interested in reading and these recommendations are displayed in your private account;</li>
			<li class="mendeley_features" style="padding-bottom:0px;">preparing individualized statistical information which will only be made available to you via your private account; and</li>
			<li class="mendeley_features" style="padding-bottom:0px;">generating anonymous aggregate statistical information regarding all users' interests, habits and reading patterns. This statistical data does not contain any personally identifiable information and is made available to registered users and other interested third parties (such as publishers) on an anonymous and aggregated basis. For example, it is possible for us to know which articles are read by users and for how long. We do not store this information in a way that links it to a particular individual. So we do not know that Mr Smith spent 3 hours reading an article concerning stem cell research by Dr Jones. We only know that a researcher based in London spent 3 hours reading that article.</li>
