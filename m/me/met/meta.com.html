                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p><b>This Statement is an addition to the Terms of Use. Therefore, the general definitions and provisions of the Terms of Use apply here.</b></p>
                <p>Meta Inc. ("Meta") doing business as Meta operates the meta.com and Meta.Science Websites in full compliance with the Canadian laws on privacy and data protection. We respect your privacy and therefore protect your personal data.</p>
                <p> For your convenience, we have arranged all information on privacy and data amp; in a "Questions &amp; Answers" section. Nevertheless, this statement is a binding agreement between the Meta and each User. You, as the User, expressly consent to storage and processing of your personal data, as described and defined in this statement.</p>
                
                <p><b>What is master data?</b></p>
                <p>Master data, in this statement, means all data related directly to a User as a person, irrespective of your actual usage of the Service. This includes, for example, your Username, e-mail address and other contact information, information about which Research Institutes, Groups, Concepts, Geographical Locations, Author Names and Published Works you are associated with. This also encompasses information that is written into a User's Profile page.</p>

                <p><b>What master data is collected and stored by Meta?</b></p>
                <p>Meta stores data you enter and submit on the Meta service; i.e., if you submit your biography to your profile page, Meta will store it. Or, if you join a Group or Institute or follow a Topic, Meta will store that information. If you choose a Paper to Save to Library, Meta will store that information.</p>

                <p><b>What master data is processed by Meta and why?</b></p>
                <p>Meta will process your data in order to run the Web service. For example, if any internet user visits your profile page, we process your data in order to show your profile page. Very basic data (e.g. your name) is visible to all users. Meta reserves the right to process your master data to generate anonymous statistics, such as publication view counts. Such anonymous statistics will contain no information about you or any other individual user.</p>

                <p><b>Does Meta process my e-mail address and send e-mails?</b></p>
                <p>Meta will process your email address solely to send e-mails to you containing information or notifications about the Service. Meta reserves the right to attach some content to those e-mails, containing advertisements and endorsements for products and services of any third party.</p>

                <p><b>How can I see what master data is stored and how can I change or delete it?</b></p>
                <p>You can see and edit your data on your profile pages. You can also delete all your master data except for your name, your e-mail address and your password. If you wish to cancel your Meta account, contact the Meta Support team. Selecting to cancel your account will permanently delete your account, and remove all personalized data from our services. If you choose to have your account cancelled, Meta will not continue store to any personal data.</p>

                <h2> III: Traffic Data</h2>
                <p><b>What is traffic data?</b></p>
                <p>Traffic data is data about your Meta usage. This is mainly tracking information on log-in times, duration, and activities while logged in. Traffic data also includes your IP address/es and information sent automatically by your Web browser such as your browser software, and preferred languages.</p>

                <p><b>What traffic does Meta collect and store?</b></p>
                <p>Meta collects your traffic data, as defined above, and will store that data for the duration of your session. A session starts when you log in and ends when you log out. During that period, your data is connected to your IP address and your user account, which has your personal information. After your session ends, Meta reserves the right to store traffic data.</p>

                <p><b>What master data is processed by Meta and why?</b></p>
                <p>Meta will process your data in order to run the Web service. For example, if any internet user visits your profile page, we process your data in order to show your profile page. Very basic data (e.g. your name) is visible to all users. Meta reserves the right to process your master data to generate anonymous statistics, such as publication view counts. Such anonymous statistics will contain no information about you or any other individual user.</p>

                <p><b>What traffic data is processed by Meta and why?</b></p>
                <p>During your session, Meta needs to process traffic data to provide the Service. After the session, Meta reserves the right to process traffic data to generate anonymous statistics. Meta uses this information to improve its services and user experience. Meta may also process traffic data for security and fraud-detection reasons. The number of profile pages you viewed is a security measure for the protection of personal data. Processing this information helps Meta detect and prevent "data harvesting", meaning automatic retrieval of profile pages to gain many users' personal data.</p>

                <p><b>How can I view stored traffic data, change or delete it?</b></p>
                <p>Please contact the Meta support team for any requests related to viewing, changing or deleting your traffic data. When you cancel your Meta account, we automatically delete your personal traffic data.</p>

                <h2> IV: Cookies</h2>
                <p><b>What are cookies?</b></p>
                <p>Cookies are small files with information that are not stored by Meta, but by your Web browser. A cookie is generated when Meta sends such request to your Web browser and your Web browser accepts it; later, your Web browser will send that cookie back to Meta on request.</p>

                <p><b>What data is stored in cookies and why will it be processed?</b></p>
                <p>If you choose this option, there will be a cookie for your login information, so that you are automatically logged in when you visit Meta. Do not use this option if the computer you use is not under your exclusive control, because other people using your computer will be able to log in to Meta without your password. Furthermore, cookies can store information about the usage of certain pages or functions within Meta. To generate such pages or functions dynamically, the information stored in the cookie will be processed randomly. Meta will never store cookie data. Cookie data is always stored on your hard drive, and will never be processed independently from your usage of the Meta website.</p>

                <h2> V: Transmission of data</h2>
                <p><b>Will Meta sell personal data to any third parties?</b></p>
                <p>No. Meta will absolutely not sell personal data.</p>

                <p><b>What about other third parties processing data on behalf of Meta?</b></p>
                <p>Meta reserves the right to appoint certain tasks to third parties, such as database or software development. For that purpose, it might be necessary for personal data to be shared with and processed by such third parties. In this case, Meta remains fully responsible for your personal data and will bind any and all third parties to a written agreement ensuring they comply with this statement on privacy and data protection. Meta is committed to your privacy, hence we are dedicated to choosing contractors that are trustworthy and who will operate in strict accordance with laws on privacy and data protection.</p>
