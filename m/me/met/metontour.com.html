<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffff00" size="4">Metallica in partnership with Iventa Privacy Policy</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Iventa has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: <a href="http://www.metontour.com/" target="_blank">www.MetOnTour.com</a>.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I.&nbsp; Information Iventa gathers</font></b> <br><font face="Verdana" size="2">We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address), demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level), as well as other optional categories (like hobbies, interests, and online habits). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">II.&nbsp; Cookies<br></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">We use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site and for other tracking purposes.&nbsp; Cookies help customize your experience and make your visits more enjoyable.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">III.&nbsp; How the information is used<br></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners.&nbsp; The demographic and profile data that we collect is used to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.&nbsp; The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. An Iventa member's email address will only be used by Iventa to periodically contact that member about member-selected interests.&nbsp; Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used for those members wishing to obtain paid services and merchandise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">IV.&nbsp; With who information is shared<br></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Iventa does not provide individually identifiable information to third parties except as noted under "Limits of Confidentiality."&nbsp; Iventa uses proprietary technologies to preserve the anonymity of users while matching their interests with targeted information that may be viewed at Iventa's partner websites. Iventa will under no circumstance reveal any member's identity to an advertiser. It is solely at a member's discretion if he or she chooses to provide personally identifiable information to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or communicating directly with the company or organization after visiting its web site. Contact information provided by Advertisers and Partners is never provided to third parties except as noted under "Limits of Confidentiality."</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>V.&nbsp; Limits of Confidentiality</b><br>Iventa may, due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, be forced to disclose individually identifiable information to third parties. In the unlikely event we are forced to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can disclose any information to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This site contains links to other sites. Iventa<b> </b>is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>VI.&nbsp; Security Measures<br></b>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.&nbsp; Iventa has made a substantial investment in the latest server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect the information assets of the Iventa Network. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center. These investments mean that information about the identity and preferences of individual members is never accessible to anyone outside Iventa and its partner sites.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>VII.&nbsp; Children's Guidelines<br></b>Iventa's website meets the guidelines of TRUSTe's Children's program.&nbsp; We will not accept registrations from children under the age of 13 due to the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html" target="_blank">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</a> ("COPPA"). COPPA was enacted to prevent websites from collecting and/or distributing information from children without their parents' consent.&nbsp; In order to comply with the standards set forth in this Act, Iventa will suspend site registration by children under age 13 indefinitely. For more information on COPPA, please refer to the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/" target="_blank">Federal Trade Commission Website.</a>&nbsp; Iventa agrees to the following:</font></p>
