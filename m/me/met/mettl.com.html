        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="a-block last">
            <p>At Mettl, we respect your need for online privacy and protect any Personal Information that you may share with us, in an appropriate manner. Our practice as regards use of your Personal Information is as set forth below in this Privacy Policy Statement. As a condition to use of Mettl Services, you consent to the terms of the Privacy Policy Statement as it may be updated from time to time. In the event of a material change, we shall notify you via email or by means of a prominent notice on the website. This Privacy Policy Statement applies exclusively to www.mettl.com.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Statement explains what information Induslynk Training Services Private Limited ("Induslynk” or “Mettl” or “Mettl.com” or we), owners of the domain www.mettl.com collects on http://www.mettl.com and internet tools accessible from this web site ("Web Site"), how Mettl uses that information, your choices and this Web Site’s other privacy practices. This Privacy Statement only covers information collected at this Web Site, and does not cover any information collected at any other web site or offline by Mettl, our affiliates or any other company (unless specifically stated). Please read this Privacy Statement carefully.</p>
            <h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>
            <p>We collect two kinds of information from you: non-personal information and personal information.</p>
            <p>Personal information is information we collect through this Web Site that we can use to specifically identify you, and may include your:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>name, telephone number, social security number and e-mail address</li>
                <li>credit card or similar information</li>
                <li>past employment history</li>
                <li>information you provide in online tests, including responses to test questions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You have the right to request the modification or deletion of any personal information retained by Mettl that is inaccurate, except that information relating to your test scores and performance, as set forth below. You understand that Mettl, in its sole discretion, will determine whether personal information should be modified or deleted.</p>
            <p>We collect personal information from you through the Web Site only when you voluntarily share it with us, such as when you fill out a registration form, an online survey, or send us an e-mail; if you choose to purchase a product or apply for a job with us or our clients; or when you use one of our online forms.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-personal information</strong> is information we collect through this Web Site that does not identify you by name or as an individual person. It may include information like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the type of web browser software your computer uses;</li>
                <li>pages your computer visited and date and time your computer accessed our pages;</li>
                <li>personal information that has been de-identified; and</li>
                <li>the IP (internet protocol) address associated with your computer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cookies: We collect non-personal information from your computer’s web browser. A cookie is an information file that the Web Site places on your computer for record keeping and site navigation purposes. The cookie placed on your computer by the Web Site does not store your name, e-mail address or any other personal information about you. Your browser software can be set to reject cookies, including the cookie from our Web Site. However, please note that if you reject our cookies, you will not be able to use this Web Site.</p>
            <h2>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>We do not restrict the ways that we use or disclose non-personal information. We will use non-personal information from you to help us make this Web Site more useful to users and for other business purposes</p>
            <p>For instance, we may use non-personal information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>create reports to develop programs, products, services or content</li>
                <li>customize the information or services that are of interest to you, or</li>
                <li>share it with or sell it to third parties</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may use personal information we collect from you through this Web Site:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to respond to your requests, including your request to be evaluated for possible employment opportunities;</li>
                <li>to provide you with products or services that you request;</li>
                <li>to provide you access to Mettl’s products or services;</li>
                <li>to develop records, including records of your personal information;</li>
                <li>for analytical purposes and to research, develop and improve programs, products, services and content;</li>
                <li>To remove your personal identifiers (your name, e-mail address, social security number, etc). In this case, you would no longer be identified as a single unique individual. Once we have de-identified information, it is non-personal information and we may use and treat it like other non-personal information;</li>
                <li>contact you regarding any problems or questions we have relating to your use of the Web Site, or, in our discretion, notify you of changes to our Privacy Statement, Terms of Use or other policy or terms that affect you or your use of the Web Site;</li>
                <li>to enforce this Privacy Statement or the Terms of Use;</li>
                <li>to protect our rights or property;</li>
                <li>to protect someone’s health, safety or welfare; or</li>
                <li>To comply with a law or regulation, court order or other legal process.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2>
            <p>Unless otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Statement or at the time you provide your information, Mettl will only share your personal information with third parties under the following limited circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We may share the personal information you provide with the organization to which you are applying for a job, and with any of its suppliers who are involved in the application process.</li>
                <li>We may also share your personal information with our parent, subsidiary, or affiliated companies (Related Companies) for our or their internal business purposes; but we do not share this information for their independent marketing purposes. </li>
                <li>In the ordinary course of business, we also will share some personal information with companies that we hire to perform services or functions on our behalf. For example, we may use different vendors or suppliers to process your credit card information or to ship you products that you order from the Web Site. In such cases those third parties may have access to your personal information in order to provide the services on our behalf.</li>
                <li>We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting Web Site users who violate our rules or engage in behaviour which is harmful (or illegal) to other users. Mettl may transfer and disclose information about our users, including personally identifiable information, to enforce this Privacy Statement and the other rules about your use of this Web Site, protect our rights or property, protect someone else’s safety or welfare, or comply with a law or regulation, court order or other legal process.</li>
                <li>Mettl reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including personal information, in connection with a corporate sale, merger, dissolution, or acquisition, or similar transaction</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>RETENTION AND YOUR CHOICES AND ABILITY TO ACCESS PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>Even if you are no longer registered, we will maintain copies of your information in our internal records, systems, and databases. We will continue to treat your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
            <p>Mettl provides individuals reasonable opportunity to access and update their personal information, subject to the qualifications noted below. You have the right to obtain confirmation from Mettl that we have retained personal data about you, as well as a written description of the nature of that personal data, the purposes for which it is being used, the sources of the personal data and a list of the recipients with whom we have shared your personal data. You also have the right to request the modification or deletion of any personal information retained by Mettl that is inaccurate. Please contact us at the address appearing below to inquire about your personal information. Mettl reserves the right to charge a modest fee for providing you access to your personal information.</p>

Similarly, certain information you provide in preliminary question forms completed prior to or following a test session are immediately disclosed to the Test Administrator. Upon reasonable request, Mettl will provide you an opportunity to access and update your personal information that we have on file. We recommend, however, that you follow up as well with your Test Administrator to update the personal information held on file by that entity.
