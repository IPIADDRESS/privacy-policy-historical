    <h3><small>INFORMATION COLLECTED</small></h3>

    <p>We collect two kinds of information from you: non-personal information and personal information.</p>

    <p>
        Personal information is information we collect through this Web Site that we can use to specifically identify you,
        and may include your:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>name, telephone number and e-mail address</li>
        <li>credit card or similar information</li>
        <li>past employment history</li>
        <li>information you provide in online tests, including responses to test questions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We collect personal information from you through the Web Site only when you voluntarily share it with us, such as
        when you fill out a registration form, an online survey, or send us an e-mail; if you choose to purchase a product
        or apply for a job with us or our clients; or when you use one of our online forms.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Non-personal information</strong>
        is information we collect through this Web Site that does not identify you by name or as an individual person. It
        may include information like:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>the type of web browser software your computer uses;</li>
        <li>pages your computer visited and date and time your computer accessed our pages;</li>
        <li>personal information that has been de-identified; and</li>
        <li>the IP (internet protocol) address associated with your computer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We also proctor tests using webcam. We may capture live images through the web camera enabled tests. This is to
        prevent candidates from navigating away from the test window while the exam is ongoing. Also, to prevent
        impersonation and use of unfair means.
    </p>

    <p>
        You have the right to request the modification or deletion of any personal information retained by Mettl that
        is inaccurate, except that information relating to your test scores and performance, as set forth below.
        (You may request for modification or deletion of any personal information by emailing our Customer Support at
        privacy@mettl.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below .
        You understand that Mettl, in its sole discretion, will determine whether personal information should be modified
        or deleted. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days).
    </p>

    <p>
        We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Web site,
        to track user's movements around the Web site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
