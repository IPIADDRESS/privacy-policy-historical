          standards, protecting its users' privacy, observing

          expect from users of our site and what users can expect
          from us.</p>

          <p>King County links to external Web sites in the hope

          them. Moreover, in no way should an external link be
          considered any form of endorsement by King County.</p>

            <p><strong>Preface</strong></p>

            <p>King County, as a government entity, conducts public
            business and its records related to the business of
            King County are generally available for public review.
            Nevertheless, King County is committed, to the extent
            allowable by law, to protect and secure your personal
            information contained in King County records. This
            privacy commitment must be balanced with the rights of
            public access under Chapter <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/rcw/index.cfm?fuseaction=chapterdigest&amp;chapter=42.17">
            42.17 RCW</a> (external link, Washington Public
            Disclosure Act) consistent with <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/mkcc/code/05-Title%202.pdf">

            and any other applicable federal, state,
            and local statute or regulation.</p>

            <p>This privacy notice does not apply to personnel
            files, job applications, court records, law enforcement
            investigation, regulatory investigation, assessor
            records, and recorded documents maintained by the Records,
            Elections, and Licensing Services division.</p>

            <p><strong>Information privacy</strong></p>

            <p>King County gathers personal information when it is
            relevant and necessary to accomplish county business.
            We only obtain this information through legal means.
            When King County collects personal information from
            you, we:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Tell you why we are collecting this personal
              information;</li>

              <li>Limit the amount of your personal information
              that we collect to that which is necessary for the
              stated purpose;</li>

              <li>Take reasonable steps to use your personal
              information to the stated purpose;</li>

              <li>Take steps to ensure that your personal
              information is accurate, complete and current;</li>

              <li>Provide your personal information only to
              authorized King County employees and private
              contractors or public organizations on a need-to-know
              basis;</li>

              <li>Do not sell or make your personal information
              available to others without your consent except when
              legally required, needed to complete your transaction
              with the county, or in an extreme emergency that
              presents a threat of serious injury or loss of
              life;</li>

              <li>Retain personal information only as long as
              necessary to conduct county business or only to the
              extent required by law;</li>

              <li>Dispose of personal information in a secure
              manner that prevents disclosure;</li>

              <li>Take organizational, technological, and physical
              measures to securely safeguard personal
              information.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Information privacy specific to the
            Internet</strong></p>

            <p>We also collect information on our Web site, both
            anonymous and personal.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Anonymous information cannot be linked to a
              specific person, such as user hits, visits and
              sessions that we track by Internet service provider.
              We use this information to help us create a better
              overall experience for our Web site users.</li>

              <li>Cookies are another example of anonymous
              information that we use. Web site cookies are small
              text files that are placed on a user's computer
              by a Web server. We occasionally use cookies to
              tailor information to the needs of a user's
              specific browser. Our Web server is unable to
              determine any data about you nor does it do anything
              with these cookies.</li>

              <li>Personal information collected on certain King
              County Web pages is data that you provide to us about
              yourself. Providing information to us on our Web site
              is purely voluntary. This information is used to
              better serve you. Should you choose not to provide
              information to King County on the Internet, you may
              provide this information to us in another way, such
              as visiting a county office during normal business
              hours or, for some county services, completing your
              business by mail or telephone.</li>

              <li>When King County collects personal information
              from children using the Internet, it complies with
              the federal <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">Children's
              Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (external
              link).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>King County's Web site has links to other Web
            sites, including other government agencies, non-profit
            organizations and private businesses. When you link to
            one of these external Web sites, you are no longer on
            King County's Web site and this privacy notice no
            longer applies. Instead, you are subject to the privacy
            notice of that Web site.</p>

            <p><strong>Review and correct your personal
            information</strong></p>

            <p>Upon written request to a specific King County
            agency, you may review personal information that the
            agency maintains about you and ask that agency to
            correct errors.</p>

            <p>Upon written request to a specific King County
            agency, you may receive a written statement that
            generally identifies the known circumstances under
            which personal information in the agency's public
            records may be disclosed.</p>

            <p>To find out more, contact King County at the e-mail
            address or telephone number listed below.</p>

            <p><strong>Other King County privacy
            notices</strong></p>

            <p>Some King County organizations may have privacy
            notices that are more restrictive than this information
            privacy notice. In that case, the organization's
            specific privacy notice takes precedence over this
            information privacy notice. For privacy inquiries
            specific to a King County organization's privacy
            notice, please contact that organization directly.</p>
