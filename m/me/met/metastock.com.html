  <h4>
      Consent to Share Information
  </h4>
  <p>
      When you provide information to MetaStock we do not sell or share this information with third parties without your express consent. The only exception to this is defined in the Thomson Reuters, Exchanges, and Third Party Add-ons section(s) of the privacy policy. Third parties may from time to time offer deals or training on products that require that we share information, however, we will not share this information unless you give your express consent through an opt in process. Once you have shared your information with a third party, we cannot be held responsible for their privacy policies.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Consent to Transfer</h4>
  <p>

  <h4>Thomson Reuters</h4>
  <p>
    MetaStock uses Thomson Reuters permissioning and authentication systems to allow you access to MetaStock, MetaStock Pro, and MetaStock          XENITH.  By subscribing to or for any of these services your information will be automatically shared with Thomson Reuters to allow you access to the            products you have purchased.

  <h4>
    Exchanges</h4>
  <p>
    Exchanges reserve the right to contact any subscribers to their exchanges for any
    reason. When you subscribe to a real-time exchange (such as the New York Stock Exchange,
    or the London Metals Exchange), MetaStock is required to pass your contact
    information to that exchange. Typically client exchange communication will come
    from MetaStock but each exchange you have subscribed to reserves the right
    to contact you directly.</p>
  <h4>Third Party Add-ons</h4>    
  <p>
    Select MetaStock add-ons use third party systems to authenticate and
    authorize usage to allow you access to products. In order for you to be
    able to access an add-on that uses these third party systems, MetaStock
    must share your information with a third party. MetaStock strives to have
    confidentiality agreements with these vendors to ensure that your
    information is not misused or shared, however, we cannot guarantee the
    usage of third party systems through systems and services that we do not
    maintain. If you have questions on which of the add-ons use these third
    party systems please contact MetaStock sales. By using any of these
    products, you agree to have your information shared with a third party.
  </p>

  <p>
    These Web Sites contain links to third party sites as well as to other sites owned
    and/or operated by MetaStock. Please be aware that MetaStock is not
