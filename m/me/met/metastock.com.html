    Data Security</h4>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally identifiable

    risk.</p>
  <h4>
    Consent to Transfer</h4>
  <p>

    for personal information as the one in which you reside. We are taking appropriate
    steps to provide an adequate level of protection to your personal information and
    no matter where you live, your personal information will be processed in accordance
    with the other provisions of this Privacy Statement. By using our Web Site, participating

  <h4>Thomson Reuters</h4>
  <p>
    MetaStock uses Thomson Reuters permissioning and authentication systems to allow you access to MetaStock, MetaStock Pro, and MetaStock          XENITH.

  <h4>
    Exchanges</h4>
  <p>
    Exchanges reserve the right to contact any subscribers to their exchanges for any
    reason. When you subscribe to a real-time exchange (such as the New York Stock Exchange,

    information to that exchange. Typically client exchange communication will come
    from MetaStock but each exchange you have subscribed to reserves the right
    to contact you directly.</p>
  <h4>Third Party Add-ons</h4>    
  <p>
    Select MetaStock add-ons use third party systems to authenticate and
    authorize usage to allow you access to products. In order for you to be
    able to access an add-on that uses these third party systems, MetaStock
    must share your information with a third party. MetaStock strives to have
    confidentiality agreements with these vendors to ensure that your
    information is not misused or shared, however, we cannot guarantee the
    usage of third party systems through systems and services that we do not
    maintain. If you have questions on which of the add-ons use these third
    party systems please contact MetaStock sales. By using any of these
    products, you agree to have your information shared with a third party.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Links</h4>
  <p>
    These Web Sites contain links to third party sites as well as to other sites owned
    and/or operated by MetaStock. Please be aware that MetaStock is not
    responsible for the privacy practices of any third party sites. Please also be aware
    that the privacy policies of other MetaStock sites may differ significantly
    from the privacy policy of these Web Sites. Therefore, we encourage our users to
    read the privacy statement of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable
    information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by this
