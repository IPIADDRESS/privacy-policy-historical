 </p><p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer and tied to information about you. By using and browsing
                our Sites, you consent to the use by us and third parties of cookies and other technologies in accordance
                with this Policy. </p><p><strong>What are the different types of cookies?</strong>
 </p><p>First party cookies are our own cookies set by our Site, controlled by us, and used to provide information about
                the usage of our Site.</p><p>Third party cookies are cookies from any other domain. Some of our business partners (for example, third-party
                advertisers) may use cookies on the Site, in emails or in our advertisements on other websites to allow them
                to deliver the services they are providing. In order to create a user-friendly experience, some of our third-party
                promotions and advertisements are designed to automatically transmit users' information onto the third party's
                landing page when you choose to "click" upon a third party's advertisement or promotion. We do not control
                these third parties or their use of cookies. As such, this Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company
                and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party advertisers. Please check the websites of those
                third parties for details on how they use cookies.</p><p><strong>How long do cookies stay on your computer?</strong>
 </p><p>Two types of cookies may be used on the Site, session cookies and persistent cookies.</p><p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in your browser or device until you leave the site; they are
                deleted from your device once you leave the Service.</p><p>Persistent cookies are small files stored on your hard drive until you delete them or until they reach their
                expiry date. These may, for example, be used to remember your preferences when you use the Site, recognize
                you on your return, and enhance your experience on the Site (see more about profiles below). Use of a persistent
                cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Site except if you choose to
                store your user names and PINs so that you do not have to enter them each time you access your accounts.
                Then, a persistent cookie will be stored on your computer, which is linked to your account information. If
                you reject the persistent cookie, you may still use the Site but you will be limited in some areas of it.
                </p><p><strong>How do we use cookies?</strong>
 </p><p>We may use cookies for the following purposes (either on our own or by using third party services): </p><ul><li>Authentication and Preferences: Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit our Sites, remember your
                    preferences (such as languages and communication preferences), and customize your experience with using
                    our Sites and Services.</li><li>Security: Cookies may enable and support our security features and to help us detect malicious activity.
                    </li><li>Advertising: Cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off our Sites. We may also use a cookie
                    to learn whether someone who saw an ad later visited and took an action on the advertiser's site. Similarly,
                    our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we've shown an ad and how it performed, or provide
                    us with information about how you interact with ads. We may also work with a partner to show you an ad
                    on or off our Sites, such as after you have visited a partner's site or application.</li><li>Analytics: We use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features, and services, including
                    when you access our Sites from other websites, applications, or devices such as your mobile device.</li><li>Geo-Location Information: Some devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information
                    (for example, GPS). Some photos or other contact you place within our Service may contain recorded location
                    information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. Also, some of the information we
                    collect from a device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a device’s location.</li><li>Flash Cookies: We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as
                    video clips or animation. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface
                    that is different from the one provided by your web browser. This means that it is not possible to manage
                    Flash cookies at the browser level in the same way you would manage other types of cookies. Instead,
                    you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s website directly. </li></ul><p><strong>What other technologies do we use?</strong>
 </p><ul><li>Log Files: Like most websites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer our sites, track user’s
                    movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The log file information
                    consists of IP addresses, browser type, browser language, referring URL, platform type, etc., and is
                    not linked to identifiable personal information.</li><li>Clear Gifs: Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and we
                    may use them to track the online movements of our users. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are
                    much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may also use
                    clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This
                    allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing
                    campaigns. </li><li>Profile: We may store information that we collect to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information
                    that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information
                    may be tied to users' personally identifiable information to improve the content of the Site for users,
                    improve our Services and provide new services that are likely to be of interest to users and to direct
                    pertinent product updates and marketing promotions to users if they have opted in to receive those promotions.
                    We do not share personally identifiable elements of a user’s profile with other third parties. User profiles
                    are shared in aggregate form only.</li><li>Do Not Track Response: Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a “do not track” option that sends signals
                    to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different
                    from blocking cookies as browsers with the “do not track” option selected may still accept cookies. Right
                    now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to “do not track” signals, although
                    one may be adopted in the future. We do not respond to “do not track” signals at this time. If we do
                    so in the future, we will modify this Privacy Policy accordingly. More information about “do not track”
                    is available at www.allaboutdnt.org.</li></ul><p><strong>Can I Change My Cookie Preferences?</strong>
 </p><p>Browser settings allow you to choose whether or not to accept cookies or limit certain cookies. Most browsers
                also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies. If you use our Sites without changing
                your browser settings, we will assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on our Sites. Please be aware
                that if cookies are disabled, not all features of the Site may operate as intended. </p><p>Your mobile operating system may let you opt out from having your information collected or used for interest-based
                advertising on mobile devices. You should refer to the instructions provided by your mobile device’s manufacturer,
                but this functionality is usually available in the “Settings” section of your device. You can also stop us
                from collecting information through our applications by uninstalling our applications. For more information
                about these specialized cookies and other technologies, and to learn more about behavioral advertising or
                to opt out of this type of advertising for some companies, you can visit http://www.networkadvertising.org
