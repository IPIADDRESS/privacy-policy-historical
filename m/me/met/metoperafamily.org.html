</p>
<p>
	We have prepared this policy statement so you will be aware of what information is collected about visitors to our web sites and how that information is used.  From time to time, our practices may change necessitating changes to the policy as it exists now.

	<h4>What Information About You Is Collected and How Is It Used? </h4>
	
<p>
	<b>Anonymous Information</b>

Some anonymous, statistical information is automatically logged when you access one of our sites. These "access logs" allow us to make our sites more useful to you and others who use them by, for example, tracking which features of the site are most used by visitors.  None of this information, which is listed below, is associated with any personal information or contains anything identifying you personally: 
</p>	
<ul>
	<li>The date of the visit</li> 
	<li>The time of arrival and length of visit </li>
	<li>The browser used (e.g., AOL, Netscape, Safari, etc.) </li>
	<li>A list of files downloaded or pages viewed </li>
	<li>The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the machine through which the site was accessed</li>
	<li>Any errors encountered</li>
</ul>

<p><b>"Cookies"</b></p>

If you do not wish a cookie to be placed on your computer, however, you can adjust the settings on your browser accordingly, although doing so will limit the range of features that will be available for your use on our site.
