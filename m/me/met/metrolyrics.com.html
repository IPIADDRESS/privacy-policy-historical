	<h1>MetroLeap Media Inc. Privacy Statement</h1>

	<div id="PrivacyStatement">
		<h1>MetroLyrics,MetroPosts and MetroLeap Media Inc. Privacy Statement</h1>
	
		<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

		<p id="Intro">
			MetroLyrics is a web portal owned by MetroLeap Media Inc.<br>
			MetroPosts is discussion forum owned by MetroLeap Media Inc.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>
			MetroLeap recognizes that your privacy and the protection of your personal
			information is important to you. This statement discloses how MetroLeap helps
			protect your personal information while using the MetroLyrics Web Site 
			(<a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com">www.metrolyrics.com</a>) and its discussion
			forum MetroPosts (<a href="http://www.metroposts.com">www.metroposts.com</a>).
			Privacy statement is applicable to both MetroLyrics and MetroPosts, and whenever
			we refer to MetroLyrics it is applicable to MetroPosts too and vice versa.
		</p>
		<p>
			MetroLyrics provides lyrics and music information such as albums and artists'
			biographies, as well as discussion forum to its visitors and members. All
			lyrics are copyrighted material of artist and/or their representatives. Lyrics
			are submitted by MetroLyrics' visitors and members, and could be inaccurate
			or incomplete. Please see MetroLyrics' Terms of Use for more information
			about MetroLyrics offerings and limitations.
		</p>
		<p>
			The MetroLyrics Kids Privacy Statement is a separate statement that describes
			the collection, use and disclosure by MetroLyrics of personal information from
			or about children and the service for obtaining parental consent.
		</p>
		
		<h2>METROLYRICS'COLLECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
		
		<p>
			As described in greater detail below, we collect and process personal information
			for four primary reasons:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>to operate an authentication service;</li>
			<li>to provide you with better services based on your needs, demographic, and region either by MetroLyrics or our partners;</li>
			<li>to facilitate registration and effective participation at MetroPosts Forum, and</li>
			<li>to improve security and provide customer support for your MetroLyrics account.</li>

		</ul>
		
		<h3>What Information Is Collected by MetroLyrics</h3>
		<p>
			MetroLyrics collects only that information which is necessary to carry out the
			four purposes described above. MetroLyrics collects information about your online
			activity at the web site, such as number of submitted lyrics, in order to select
			winners in promotions and improve your on-line experience.. If using the Forum,
			you can select how much of your information will be shared with other members.
			You can change this information at any time from Forum Control Panel.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you register with MetroLyrics, you will be asked to provide certain personal
			information that will be stored in the MetroLyrics Members "profile." As
			described below, the amount of information requested will vary depending on your
			preference, where some information will be mandatory in order to register.
			MetroLyrics Members profile contains, at most, the following personal information: (1)
			e-mail address, (2) first and last name, (3) country or region, (4) state or
			territory, (5) ZIP code or postal code, (6) language, (7) time zone, (8) gender,
			(9) birth date, (10) occupation, and (11) alternate e-mail address.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you register for your Member's Account, you will be asked to create a password
			for your account. You may also be requested to provide secret questions and secret
			answers. You use your secret questions and answers to help verify your identity to
			MetroLyrics when there are account issues, such as needing to reset your password.
		</p>
		
		<h2>METROLYRICS' USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
		
		<h3>How MetroLyrics Will Not Use Your Personal Information</h3>
		<p>
			MetroLyrics <strong>will not</strong> use or share your personal information in a
			manner that differs from what is described in this Privacy Statement without
			your prior consent.
		</p>
		
		<h3>How MetroLyrics Uses Your Personal Information</h3>
		<p>
			MetroLyrics uses your personal information for the operation and maintenance of your
			account and the MetroLyrics Service. For example, MetroLyrics may use your e-mail address
			to send you a welcome e-mail message when you first register informing you about
			the service, telling you how to manage your account. You will receive a separate
			e-mail to which you must respond in order to validate that you are the owner of
			the e-mail address associated with your account at MetroLyrics. Failure to
			respond to the e-mail and verify the address within four days will cause the
			members account to become inactive. This process is designed to verify the
			validity of the e-mail address and to help prevent e-mail addresses from being
			used without permission in the creation of MetroLyrics accounts.
		</p>
		<p>
			MetroLyrics may also send you e-mail about periodic service or recommended security
			updates. These periodic e-mails are considered essential to the provision of the
			service you have requested. You cannot unsubscribe from these mailings. In addition,
			you may subscribe to receive MetroLyrics e-mail newsletter. You can unsubscribe from
			this service at any time.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you need to reset your password and cannot access your primary e-mail account,
			MetroLyrics may send password reset e-mail to your alternate e-mail address.
		</p>
		
		<h2>METROLYRICS' GENERAL DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
		
		<p>
			MetroLyrics occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our
			behalf, such as answering customer support inquiries or performing statistical
			analyses of our services. MetroLyrics will only provide these companies with those
			pieces of your personal information needed to deliver the services, and the companies
			and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any
			other purpose.
		</p>
		<p>
			MetroLyrics may provide your e-mail address to our partners to be used at their
			discretion. This may be done only if you allowed us to do so. Your approval is done
			by checking the form box stating clearly that you allow us to share your e-mail,
			which could be done either during the registration process or from your account
			control panel.
		</p>
		<p>
			MetroLyrics may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the
			good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements
			or comply with legal process served on MetroLyrics; (b) protect and defend the rights or
			property of MetroLyrics; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the
			personal safety of users of the MetroLyrics' Service, or the public.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Your MetroLyrics Profile Information</h3>
		<p>
			You can choose the type of information in your MetroLyrics profile to share with
			other members and general public on the MetroLyrics' Forum. You can also choose
			how much of your information we can share with our partners. You can use the
			check boxes on the 'Your MetroLyrics Profile' page to choose whether to share
			your e-mail address, your name, and/or the non-identifiable profile information,
			such as country.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Use of Shared Information by MetroLyrics' Partners</h3>
		<p>
			MetroLyrics' partners that we shared information with can use it for a variety of
			purposes. These can include personalizing your experience at their sites. MetroLyrics
			partners may share your personal information and/or unique identifier with third
			parties in order to fulfill a service or transaction you may have requested.
			In addition, they may send you unsolicited offerings based on your profile.
			If sending you unsolicited offering, they have the obligation to include
			instructions on how to take you off of their communication in the future, should
			you decide to do so.
		</p>
		
		<h2>MANAGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
		
		<h3>Access to Your Personal Information</h3>
		<p>
			You can always add, update, or make other changes to the information in your
			MetroLyrics profile.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Closing Your MetroLyrics Account</h3>
		<p>
			You may close your MetroLyrics account at any time by going to MetroLyrics Member
			Services and clicking Close my MetroLyrics account, or by contacting MetroLyrics
			customer support
		</p>
		<p>
			If you attempt to register for a MetroLyrics account and find that someone else has
			already created a MetroLyrics account with your e-mail address, you have the
			option of contacting MetroLyrics customer service and requesting that the MetroLyrics
			account using your e-mail address be forced to change so that you may use your e-mail
			address as your Account.
		</p>
		
		<h2>SECURITY AND STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
		
		<p>
			MetroLyrics is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.
			We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your
			personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
		</p>
		<p>
			You must type the correct password to access your MetroLyrics information. It is
			your responsibility to ensure the security of your MetroLyrics account password
			and not to reveal this information to others.
		</p>
		<p>
			Personal information collected by MetroLyrics may be stored and processed in
			Canada, the United States or any other country in which MetroLyrics or its affiliates,
			subsidiaries, or agents maintain facilities. By using the MetroLyrics Service,
			you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
		</p>
		
		<h2>USE OF COOKIES</h2>
		
		<p>
			A cookie is a very small text file that a Web site saves to your computer's hard disk
			to store information that you provide about yourself or to store your preferences.
		</p>
		<p>
			MetroLyrics uses cookies whenever you sign in to a MetroLyrics site. MetroLyrics
			stores your unique identifier, the time you signed in, and whatever MetroLyrics
			profile information you have chosen to share with our partners, in an encrypted
			cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page without
			having to sign in again on each page.
		</p>
		<p>
			MetroLyrics also uses cookies to improve the sign in experience. For example,
			MetroLyrics may store your e-mail address in a cookie that will remain on your
			computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be
			pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time
			you sign in.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sites or services you visited may store their own cookies on your computer.
			MetroLyrics recommends that you read each participating site's privacy statement
			to understand their policies and practices regarding the use of cookies. You have
			the ability to accept or decline cookies using the settings on your browser.

		We feature over 275,000 music lyrics and we are one of the first free sites to add the latest lyrics as new songs come out. All of our lyrics are either submitted in by users or added by moderators. If you have a lyric of song that you wish to request please do so. There is a "Request Lyrics" menu. One of the most popular entires we have are Eminem lyrics, Rihana lyrics, Christina Aguilera lyrics, Jessica Simpson lyrics, Justin Timberlake lyrics, Beyonce Knowles lyrics, and Nelly Furtado. Those average out to almost 20% of our current traffic. Our lyric search allows you to search though our lyrics database and if a match is not found you may request the lyric and it will get uploaded within a few days at the maximum. Furthermore recently we've been receiving e-mails in regards to Mp3 files. We do not distribute nor produce Mp3 files. If you wish to download Mp3s on the Internet we highly urge you to visit any Mp3 download site and download Mp3s at a rate of $1 / file which helps the music industry tremendously. The request form above is not used for Mp3s but lyrics only.
