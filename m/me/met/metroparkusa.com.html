                International Shipping</h3>
            <p>
                For orders shipped outside the United States, the billing and shipping address must
                be the same. Shipping will be provided via your choice of UPS or Global Express
                Mail through the United States Postal Service. Please use a valid street address,
                as we cannot ship to PO or APO boxes. International orders are not guaranteed to
                ship the next business day because additional verification is often necessary. UPS
                and the USPS state that most shipments are delivered within 4-5 business days. However,
                some shipments may take up to 3 weeks to arrive. Please allow time for your package
                to clear customs. This may take from a couple of days to several weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are able to ship to countries other than those listed above. Such orders cannot
                be processed on line, but you may email, fax or phone in your order. We recommend
                faxing or phoning in your credit card number; for security purposes, email is not
                advised. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@METROPARKUSA.com">
                    customerservice@METROPARKUSA.com</a>. International
                shipping fees range from $20 - $135 USD, depending on the country you live in, the
                shipping service you select, and the weight of your package. If you exchange an
                item, you will be responsible for shipping charges that apply to the reshipment
                of the item.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Customs Duties and Other Fees</h3>
            <p>
                Please note that shipping charges do not include taxes or duty. The customer is
                solely responsible for any customs, duties, foreign taxes or other fees that his/her
                country may impose to take delivery of his/her order. In order to comply with export
                regulations, we are required by U.S. law to declare the exact value of all items
                ordered and to mark them as dutiable "merchandise." Declaring less than the true
                value is both a violation of American law and the laws of most other countries.
                In addition, we could lose the right to export to your country should it ever be
                discovered that we were misrepresenting the value. Because we are a retailer, we
                are prohibited by law from marking your order as "gift," even if the order is intended
                as a gift by its recipient. Call your local customs office for details about these
                charges.

                Tips on sending the perfect return package:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Send via UPS or insured parcel post for proof of delivery. If your return package
                    is lost, we are not responsible for reimbursement or compensation for the lost merchandise.</li>
                <li>No COD (Cash/Check on Delivery) packages will be accepted.</li>
                <li>Note your RA number on the package for proper and timely handling and processing.</li>
                <li>Include a completed RA form with the merchandise. Otherwise processing will be delayed.</li>
                <li>Package your return carefully, as we cannot return or exchange items that arrive
                    damaged due to poor packaging.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Your return will be processed within 2-3 business days of receipt. We will issue
                a refund to the credit card originally used for the purchase. You will receive an
                email notice when the credit has been issued. If you have an inquiry, call
                888.273.1125
