                    <p>Metro Trains Melbourne Pty Ltd ("MTM") ACN 136 429 948 is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals.</p>
                    <p>The protection of personal information in the private sector is required by the Privacy Act 1988 as amended by the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 ("Act"). All employees and officers of MTM are expected to comply with the Act and MTM's policies and procedures concerning the protection of personal information.</p>

It explains our practices with regards to collection and processing of any personal information (i.e. information from which an individual's identity is apparent or can be reasonably ascertained) and that may be collected as a result of your use of the Site.</p>
                    <p>This policy is based on the following principles:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>privacy of personal information is of paramount importance to MTM; </li>
                    <li>your personal information will not be shared, other than in accordance with this policy without your permission or in accordance with the Act; and </li>
                    <li>we will only use your personal information for the purpose for which it was provided.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
                    <p>This Site allows you to contact MTM and companies associated with MTM by sending e-mails, for the purposes of:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>requesting information about MTM; or </li>
                    <li>making other enquiries.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By sending emails, you will be providing us with certain personal information, which may include your name, e-mail address and any other details you include in your e-mail.  This information is collected by us for the purpose of dealing with your request.  We may not be able to deal with your request without this information.</p>
                    <p>We do not collect any other personal information via the Site. We do not use cookies, personal web tracking or other devices to collect your personal information.</p>
                    <h3>What do we use personal information for?</h3>
                    <p>Any personal details that you provide as a result of accessing the Site or sending e-mails will be used for the purpose of dealing with your request or enquiry.</p>
                    <p>Your details and information about the communications you wish to receive will be held in a Database and used for the purpose of administering your request.  This may involve disclosing your personal information to other companies associated with MTM.   These organisations are required by MTM to comply with this policy. The Corporate Relations Department may use your e-mail details to contact you from time to time to provide you with information about MTM.</p>

                    <h3>Disclosing Personal Information</h3>
                    <p>
                    As noted above, we may share personal information with related companies or with contractors performing services for MTM which are required by MTM to comply with this policy.  MTM will only make such disclosures to achieve the purpose for which the information was provided.

                    <h3>Email Security</h3>
                    <p>Any emails you send will be automatically scanned, which could result in certain attachments and styles of message being automatically blocked and forwarded to our IT administrators in order to authorise the content. This is done purely for IT security purposes and our IT administrators will not access the contents of your e-mails once this process is complete.</p>
                    <h3>Security of Information</h3>
