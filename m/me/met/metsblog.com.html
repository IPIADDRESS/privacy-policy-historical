					<h1>MetsBlog.com’s Privacy Policy</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="format_text">
<p>We are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. This Privacy Policy is applicable to this Website only.</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>You can visit and enjoy the Website without disclosing any personal information about yourself. However, we offer some special services, and for these services to work properly we will need you to share with us certain personal information about yourself. The personal information we collect may include, but is not limited to, first and last name, street address, e-mail address, telephone number (e.g., home, work, mobile and/or fax), and birthdate. We may also collect other personal information that will be identified on the applicable page(s) of the Website. If you submit any personal information to us, or to our third party service providers acting on our behalf, you can be assured that we will not sell, lease, or share your personal information with or to anyone else, except as follows: (1) to our third party service providers, and only so that they may help us provide the services you’ve requested and in certain circumstances to provide you with ticket related offers; (2) upon notice posted on an applicable location of our Website where we collect your personal information for an economic transaction and notify you that we will be sharing such information with a third party, where such third party is clearly identified; and (3) on occasion, we may offer a special promotion (such as a sweepstakes, contest, fantasy game or a free subscription to goods and services) on the Website in conjunction with a third party service provider, sponsor, or promotional partner, and share your information with that third party service provider, sponsor, or promotional partner so that it can send you other special promotions it offers, but only if you give us permission to do so.</p>
<p>Special Offers and Promotions.</p>
<p>With your permission, we may also send you e-mails and text messages with special offers and promotions. If you don’t want to receive these, you may change your preferences.</p>
<p>Cookies.</p>
<p>To help us serve you better, we collect information that does not identify you personally, but rather identifies your computer or browser. This is done by using little files called “cookies” and by tracking IP addresses. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a Website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies operate in the background, and you can turn them off if you wish, but doing so may impair your ability to use some of the features on the Website.</p>
<p>Aggregated Demographic Information.</p>
<p>We may share aggregated demographic information with third parties, but this information is not linked to any personal information that can identify you or another individual person. Therefore, no personal information is disclosed in this manner.</p>
<p>Business Transfers.</p>
<p>As time passes, MetsBlog.com may be sold along with its assets, or other transactions may occur in which customer information is one of the business assets transferred. In such a case, the customer information which we have gathered may be one of the business assets we transfer.</p>
<p>Disclosure for Legal Purposes.</p>
<p>The law requires that we may be required to share your personal information and non-personal information (see “Cookies” section above for examples of non-personal information) pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants or orders. If we are required to do so, we will, of course, obey the law. In addition, notwithstanding any term to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to use and disclose share your personal and non-personal information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Website’s Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>Links</p>
<p>The Website may contain links to other sites operated by unrelated third parties. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party websites. We encourage you to be aware of this when your leave the Website and to read the privacy policies of every website that collects personally identifiable information from you.</p>
<p>The Privacy Policy applies only to this Website.</p>
<p>Special Rules For Children</p>
<p>Because of federal law, we cannot collect any personal information from a child under the age of thirteen without the consent of that child’s parent. The statements in this Privacy Policy generally about our collection and use of personal information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, where permission has been granted by a parent or guardian.</p>
