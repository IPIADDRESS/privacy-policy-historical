    <p>
        You may use www.metmuseum.org without registering or submitting any personally 
        identifiable information. However, registration in My Met Museum enables you to 
        maintain your contact information and sign up for exclusive online features such 
        as My Met Calendar, My Met Gallery, and free email newsletters. Registration in 
        Concerts &amp; Lectures enables you to store your contact information, preferences, 
        and interests to make purchasing tickets faster, and to receive notifications 
        about events that interest you. Registration in The Met Store provides access to 
        features such as your order history and address book.</p>
    <p>
        If you choose to register in any of these areas of the site, you will be asked 
        to provide personally identifiable information that may include a user name and 
        password, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and your 
        Membership number, if applicable. We store this information, along with your 
        other preferences, on a secure server so that you need not re-enter it when you 
        return to the website. When registering in My Met Museum, if you select 
        "Remember My Log-in," your information will be displayed automatically the next 
        time you return to My Met Museum. You may review or change your account 
        information in My Met Museum, Concerts &amp; Lectures, or The Met Store at any time.</p>

    <h4 class="linerule" id="donation">When You Make a Donation or Purchase a Membership</h4>
    
    <p>
        The Museum will ask you to provide personally identifiable information necessary 
        to process and service your donation or Membership purchase online, which may 
        include your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, email 
        address, and credit card number. Your credit card information will be 
        temporarily stored on a secure server and used only for processing your online 
        transaction. We will retain the personally identifiable information you provided 
        for our records, and to facilitate customer service. The Museum never shares the 
        personally identifiable information you provide when making a donation or 
        purchasing a Membership online, through the mail, in person, or by telephone 
        with third parties for marketing purposes, except as required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        In certain cases, you may be asked for additional information required to 
        complete and service your request, such as the names of your children when 
        joining The Met Family Circle. (See <a href="#children">Children Under Thirteen 
        Years of Age</a>.)

        necessary to fulfill your online order or catalogue request, which may include 
        your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, and credit card 
        number. This is the same information requested when you place an order by 
        telephone or through the mail. For online orders or catalogue requests, we also 
        require your email address so that you can receive order and shipping 
        confirmation emails, and so that we can communicate with you if we have 
        difficulty processing your order or request. When you make a purchase, your 
        credit card information will be stored temporarily on a secure server, and we 
        will retain the personally identifiable information you provided with your order 
        for our records, to facilitate customer service, and to inform you of our 
        products and promotional offers. If you are a registered customer at The Met 
        Store, your credit card information will be saved for the next time you shop

        shopping registration process. You may also email us at

        identifiable information with third parties for marketing purposes.
