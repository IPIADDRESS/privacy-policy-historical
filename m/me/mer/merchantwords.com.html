<p><strong>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We and our service providers use cookies in connection with our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is stored on your computer’s or mobile device's memory. Some cookies help you navigate our Services, including setting a cookie to remember your login details. Cookies also help us better understand the effectiveness of our Services and to highlight areas we can improve (for example, by tracking the way in which you respond to, select and interact with our Services, by allowing us to evaluate aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services). If you submit an inquiry through our Service and provide your name and email and similar information, that personal information will not be tied back to you for interest-based advertising purposes across websites and applications, however, you may receive email marketing communications from us, and you may received interest-based advertising from third parties based on cookies dropped on your device by our third party service providers. &nbsp;To opt out of marketing communications and interest-based advertising by third parties, see “</span><strong>Choices</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We and our service providers may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons", "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively "Pixel Tags") to analyze usage patterns of consumers. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, which is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page or in a mobile application and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive.

<p><strong>LEGAL BASIS RELIED ON FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA INDIVIDUALS </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MerchantWords is a data controller with respect to the personal data collected or received by us (such as email address and credit card numbers) through our Services. &nbsp;In this case, the data controller is Merchant Words, LLC. &nbsp;Depending on the data processed, we rely on various legal bases for the processing. We may process personal information (such as your email address and credit card number) with your consent or to fulfill our obligations under our contract with you, such as our obligation to give you access to our Services that you paid for and to process payment. &nbsp;On certain occasions, we may also rely on the consent of the individual to process personal information (for example, in some jurisdictions, when the user inputs personal information into the Services and consents to receive marketing communications). On other occasions we may rely on legitimate interest as a basis for processing, when it is in our legitimate interests to do so and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights. Those legitimate interests include performing our obligations with respect to providing the Services and improving our Services.</span></p>
<p><strong>RETENTION </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or an individual requests deletion in accordance with applicable law. &nbsp;See “</span><strong>Access and Rights regarding Personal Information</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><strong>CHOICES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of Marketing</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We give you choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may opt-out from receiving electronic communications from us. If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing related emails by contacting us at </span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9dedeff4ebfcfee4ddf0f8effef5fcf3e9eaf2eff9eeb3fef2f0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bfcfcdd6c9dedcc6ffd2dacddcd7ded1cbc8d0cddbcc91dcd0d2">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by clicking on the opt-out link within the email message that you receive from us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still be required to send you administrative messages relating to the Services from time to time. </span></p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of MerchantWords’ cookies</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may disable cookies, including MerchantWords cookies, by modifying the settings in your browser. &nbsp;However, please note that certain features of the Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising from Third Parties’ Cookies</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some third parties who use cookies when you visit our websites, also have opt out mechanisms either directly from their website or through an industry-developed web page. When you opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, note that the opt out only applies to the applicable browser in which you set it. Note also that most opt out tools are cookie-based. This means that, if you have cookies blocked, you will not be able to use it. Note also that if you delete cookies entirely then you will need to opt out again. Finally, note that once the opt-out has been completed, you will still receive advertisements, but such advertisements will not be interest-based ads. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you go to optout.aboutads.info or </span><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.aboutads.info/choices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can learn how to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across multiple third-party websites, online services, devices, and applications for interest-based advertising purposes.</span></p>

<p><strong>THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy does not cover, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, data or other practices of any third parties (except as required by applicable law), including any third parties operating any site or service to which our Services link. The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. These third parties are bound by their own privacy policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except as required by applicable law, we are also not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of our social media platform providers, operating system providers, wireless service providers or device manufacturers, including any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Services.</span></p>
<p><strong>SENSITIVE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose to us, any sensitive information (e.g., social security numbers or other government identifiers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, medical or health conditions, criminal background, trade union membership, or sexual orientation) on or through the Services or otherwise to us, except where such information is legally required.</span></p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information that we collect is stored using procedures and practices reasonably designed to help protect from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed by us. </span></p>
<p><strong>USE OF SERVICES BY MINORS</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Services are not intended for, nor directed to, individuals under the age of 18, and we request that these individuals, and any other individual considered a minor under applicable law, not provide personal information through any of the Services. </span></p>
<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS AND MODEL CLAUSES</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that the information we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location. Please be advised that we process and store information in any country where we have facilities and/or employees, including the United States, or in which we engage service providers (for example, payment providers who charge your credit card for our services or vendors who provide us with cloud storage services or other vendors who provide email management services or customer service). Your consent to this Privacy Policy or your use of or access to any of the Services or your submission of your information to us, represents your consent to such transfer, storage and processing outside of your country of residence, including the United States or in other countries of our service providers, which may have different data protection rules than those of your country of residence.

This means that we may transfer your information to service providers outside the EEA for the purpose of providing our Services to you. &nbsp;We take steps to ensure that where your information is transferred outside the EEA by our service providers, appropriate measures and controls are in place to protect that information in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. In each case, we ask our service providers to transfer and process the personal information in accordance with the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In some instances, the transfer may be based on the use of the European Commission’s Standard Model Clauses for transfers of personal data outside the EEA. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
