                  website visitors. We do not sell or share individually 
                  identifiable information to any third party outside Wolverine 
                  World Wide, Inc. You will only receive communication from the 
                  branded Web site you purchased or requested information 
                  from.</p>
                  <p>Information collected on this website will be used 
                  according to the following guidelines:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
            <li>  Merrell&nbsp;collects individually identifiable information, 
            and other information that can be associated with an identifier. 
            This information is collected to provide information and services 
            to website users, and to allow Merrell to (i) analyze 
            and monitor consumer and customer activity; (ii) promote and support 
            Wolverine products; and (iii) develop a knowledge base regarding 
            its Web site users and customers. Do not submit information 
            that you do not want Wolverine to access.<br>
            <br>&nbsp; 
 
            </li><li> As is commonly done on 
                    retail websites, Merrell may use “cookies” or similar technology to keep track of its 
            customers and the goods or services they are ordering. For example, 
            we use cookies to keep track of items that you might wish 
            to store in your Shopping Cart between visits. If you do not wish to 
            accept cookies, the “help” selection on your browser’s toolbar will likely tell 
            you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies, how to 
            have the browser alert you when you receive a new cookie, 
            or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies, however, you will 
            not be able to take advantage of all of the features 
            on this Web site; therefore we recommend that you leave them turned 
            on.<br>
            <br>&nbsp;

                We may use third-party advertising companies to serve 
            ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and 
            action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) 
            to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via 
            cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.<br>
            <br>&nbsp; 
 
            </li><li>         When we ask 
            for your personal information, it is so that we can provide 
            a product or service to you and to communicate with you about 
            those products and services. This may require us to share information with our 
            business partners. For example, if you purchase goods through this website, 
            like any other retailer we will have to provide your credit 
            card information to our credit card processor and authenticator for payment purposes, and 
            your name and address to the company that ships our 
            merchandise.<br>
            <br>&nbsp; 
 
            </li><li>When we ask for your personal 
                    information, we also give you an option to opt out of 
                    additional uses of your personal information for marketing 
                    purposes. For example, we may from time to time send you an 
                    e-mail message informing you of on-line sales that you may be 
            interested in hearing about. If you do not wish to 
            receive such messages, please click on the appropriate box 
            when providing your personal information. We do not sell or 
            share identifiable information to any third party outside Wolverine World Wide, Inc. You 
            will only receive communication from the branded Web site you purchased or requested 
            information from.<br>

            activity or other governmental request, to enforce its contract or property 
            rights, or when otherwise required by law. Information we collect 
            may also be transferred in connection with any sale 
            or merger of the company or any division or 
            business line of the company to which the information relates.<br>

            partners and service providers for these purposes only upon terms

            data with third parties or otherwise making it publicly available.<br>
