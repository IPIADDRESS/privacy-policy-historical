	<h2>
		Protecting Your Privacy</h2>
	<p class="PageContent JustifiedText">
		Our Privacy Pledge is provided to help you understand how we protect your financial
		privacy. It provides you with an opportunity to make informed choices about the
		management of personal information about you. At Merrick Bank, we maintain high
		standards to safeguard Personal Information. We will remain vigilant in protecting
		that information and in using it in a fair and lawful manner.
		<br>
		<br>
		This Pledge explains our privacy commitment. It is not intended to be a contract.
		It identifies the Personal Information that we collect and hold, and describes how
		we use, share and secure it. It also tells you how to contact us if you have any
		questions regarding this Pledge or our privacy practices.
	</p>
	<p class="PageContent JustifiedText">
		<span class="BoldText">To whom and what does this Pledge apply?</span>

		and funds transfers.<br>
		<br>

		agencies, verification services, entities that provide us with mailing lists, and
		publicly available reference sources.<br>
		<br>
		•&nbsp;<span class="BoldText">From your visits to our Web site</span>, information

		<span class="BoldText">How do we use Personal Information?</span><br>
		<br>
		We use Personal Information to operate our business in a prudent and efficient manner.
		This may include, depending on the nature of your relationship with us, using it
		to evaluate financial needs; offer products and services (such as our insurance
		offerings); process and service transactions; respond to inquiries and requests;
		fulfill our obligations to you; verify income, asset and obligation information;
		resolve disputes; prevent fraud; and perform risk control. Additionally, we may
		use your Personal Information to verify your identity, including, where applicable,

		uses described above (for example, processing your application with us), we may,
		depending on the nature of your relationship with us, transfer some or all of your
		Personal Information to nonaffiliated third parties. These nonaffiliated third parties
		may be financial service providers (such as VISA USA, Inc., MasterCard International,

		non-financial companies (such as government entities in response to subpoenas, consumer
		reporting agencies or technology companies) or others (such as professional services
		organizations or other service providers).
		<br>
		<br>
		To the extent the law permits, Merrick Bank may also disclose certain Personal Information
		to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial

		Merrick Bank typically provides consumer services to adults only and does not intend

		identifying information. When such information is received and Merrick Bank is aware
		that the individual providing the information is a child, the information is used
		only to reject the child's application. Such information is never shared with third
