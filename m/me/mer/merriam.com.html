        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. We understand that you are aware of and care about your privacy rights, and we take that seriously. This Privacy Policy sets forth your privacy rights and applies to personal data we may collect:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet_indent_list">
            <li>Through our free, ad-supported website products, services and platforms;</li>
            <li>Through our free, ad-supported and subscription-based mobile applications (apps);</li>
            <li>Through emails and other electronic communications between you and us (with your consent, where required by law); and</li>
            <li>Through any software provided on or in connection with our website products, services and platforms, apps, and emails (collectively, the Services).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your decision to use the Services and provide your personal data is voluntary. We indicate on our online, mobile, and other registration forms what types of personal data are requested. You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> and  <a href="#toc5">Your Rights &amp; Choices</a> below for more information), but that may limit the services Merriam-Webster is able to provide to you.</p>

        <p>The Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect personal data from, minors under 16 years of age. We request that these individuals do not provide personal data through the Services.Please see <a href="#tocCOPPA">COPPA Compliance</a> below for more information.</p>

        <p>We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to time update this Privacy Policy as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>COPPA Compliance</h2>
        <p>In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, personally identifiable information from users known to be under thirteen (13) years of age without the consent of their educational institution or the child's parent or guardian. We do, however, use COPPA-compliant, third party services that automatically collect or share certain information and usage data with us to support our internal operations as described under <a href="#tocHowWeUse">How we use your information</a> and <a href="#tocPukuThirdParty">Puku third-party service providers</a> below.</p>
        <p>If an educational institution with students that are under thirteen (13) years of age uses our <a href="http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/">Merriam-Webster Unabridged</a> Service, the educational institution also may provide us with personally identifiable information about its students. We use student information to provide this Service to the educational institution and its students, consistent with our Merriam-Webster Unabridged <a href="http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/info/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Notice.</a></p>

                <h4>Purposes for processing (using) personal data provided directly by you</h4>
                <p>As explained above, Merriam-Webster processes your data to provide you with the products and services you have requested or purchased from us, including special features, subscriptions, newsletters, and other content. Sometimes we use third-party providers to facilitate the delivery of the services described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to your personal information for the sole purpose of providing services to you on our behalf, such as Word of the Day. Also, we may disclose your personal information in special legal circumstances. For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.</p>

                <p>To carry out these activities, Merriam-Webster may rely on many legal bases to process your personal data, including where:</p>
                <ul class="bullet_indent_list">
                    <li>necessary to perform the contractual obligations in our Terms of Service and to provide the requested Services to you;</li>
                    <li>necessary for a third party's, or our, legitimate interests;</li>
                    <li>necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to defend legal claims;</li>
                    <li>necessary to protect the public interest or vital interest of others;</li>
                    <li>you have expressly made information public; or</li>
                    <li>you have consented to the processing, which may be revoked at any time.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>We also use your data for legitimate business purposes that enable us to refine our products and services to better tailor them to your needs, communicate with you about other products and services offered by Merriam-Webster, secure your personal data, or comply with regulatory and legal obligations.</p>

                <p>You can update your personal information and change your marketing preferences at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@m-w.com">privacy@m-w.com</a>.</p>

                <h4>Payment card information</h4>
                <p>You may choose to purchase goods or services from Merriam-Webster using a payment card. Typically, payment card information is provided directly by users, via the Services, into the PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing service to which the Merriam-Webster subscribes, and Merriam-Webster does not, itself, process or store your card information. We strongly encourage you not to submit this information by email. When Merriam-Webster employees receive payment card information from users by email, fax, phone, or mail, it is entered as instructed and then deleted or destroyed.</p>

        <h2>How we respond to “Do Not Track” signals</h2>
        <p>When you visit a website in any browser, you automatically share information with that website, such as your IP address, and other standard PC information. If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider.  This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, Merriam-Webster does not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>
