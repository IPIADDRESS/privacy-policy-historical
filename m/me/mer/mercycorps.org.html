When providing your information to us via these channels, you should check the privacy policy and settings of these companies to understand how they will use and share for processing any information you have provided to them. Please find below documents on the following: Mercy Corps Europe's Data Protection Statement Mercy Corps Europe's Person's Rights Statement What information do we collect? Personal information is any information that can be used to identify you. For example, this can include your name, address, telephone number, personal or work email address, date of birth, bank details, and credit or debit card details. We only collect personal information that is relevant to the type of interaction you have with Mercy Corps Europe. For example, we will collect your credit or debit card details in order to process a donation or purchase but will not keep or store these after the transaction has been completed. Debit and credit card transactions are processed through a third party supplier; SecureHosting (powered by Monek). A description of how they meet data protection standards and protect your data can be found here. Direct Debit donations (recurring gifts) are processed through a third party supplier; Rapidata. Their terms and conditions can be found here. How do we use your information? How we use your information largely depends on the reason you have provided it to us. We may use your information in the following ways: To keep a record of your relationship with Mercy Corps Europe and for internal purposes, such as administration and accounting. To look into complaints or legal issues. To claim Gift Aid on your donations. To give you information you have asked for, update you on our work and provide you with opportunities to support and get involved with Mercy Corps Europe (see section on Direct Marketing below). To understand your needs and wishes in order to give you the best possible personalised service. To carry out analysis and research which helps us understand how we are doing and improve our communications with you. The system used to manage the administration of our contact database is called the Raiser’s Edge and is provided by Blackbaud. Their privacy policy can be found here. Direct Marketing and Consent If you have given us consent to do so, we may use your information to send you communications about our work and ways that you can get involved and provide your support. This includes information about; our fundraising appeals, volunteering opportunities, updates on our work, taking part in events and other ways to support Mercy Corps Europe. This is different from times when we are required to contact you, for example; to enable us to administer and/or confirm receipt of your donation, to reply to your questions, or to provide you with administrative updates. This section relates to fundraising and marketing communications and does not cover administrative communications such as these. Any time you provide your details to us, we will always include clear questions asking you about your preferences regarding our communications with you. You can also let us know if you wish to withdraw your consent or if you want to change your preferences at any time by contacting eu-fundops@mercycorps.org or by calling 0131 662 5160. You can also contact us in writing at the address below. Further information about communicating with you in different ways is outlined below. Data for some of our direct marketing appeals will be shared with carefully vetted suppliers for the purposes of fulfilling the appeal. These &quot;data processors&quot; will only act under our instruction and are subject to pre-contract scrutiny and contractual obligations containing strict data protection clauses. We do not allow these suppliers to use your data for their own purposes or disclose it to other third parties without our consent and we will take all reasonable care to ensure that they keep your data secure.  Contact by Email and Telephone We will only contact you by email or telephone for fundraising and marketing purposes if you have given us express permission to do so. This means you have provided your email address or telephone number to us and said that we can contact you by these means. We will hold a record of your consent which can be withdrawn or changed at any time you wish to do so. We will never conceal our identity when contacting you by email or telephone and we will always respect your preferences regarding contact of this kind. How long do we keep your information? We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity. For example, we will keep a record of donations subject to Gift Aid for six years after the accounting period relating to that donation to comply with HMRC rules. We will generally treat any consent that you give us as lasting no more than 36 months (3 years) from the date you give your consent, or from the date of your last donation or interaction you have with us. If at any time you withdraw your consent or change your preferences, your wishes will be acted on immediately and will take effect within the timescales laid out below. Who do we share your information with? Mercy Corps Europe will only use your information within our organisation for the purposes for which it was provided and for our own planning and analysis. We will not, under any circumstances, sell your personal data to any third party, and will only share data with our suppliers for the purposes described below. You will not receive marketing from any other companies, charities or organisations as a result of giving your details to us. Our Suppliers We have shared your information with carefully selected service providers and suppliers who help us to deliver our projects, fundraising activities and appeals. For example, we will share name and address details with mailing houses to allow them to print and post our letters to you, our supporters. Such “data processors” will only act under our instruction and are subject to contractual obligations regarding their data protection standards and policies. Some of these key systems and suppliers are named above. No data we hold about you is retained by any third party after it has been used for the purposes advised by Mercy Corps Europe and all personal data belonging to us is erased by a third party following the termination of a supplier contract. Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information If you let us know about any changes to your personal circumstances, we will always comply with your wishes. Our service levels for different types of communication are: Email – 48 hours from the receipt of your request Telephone – 48 hours from the receipt of your request Mail – 28 days from the receipt of your request. Due to the production timescales for our postal communications, it can often take longer for this type of change to take effect. In most cases we would expect the change to be effective much more quickly and will do our best to stop any further communications within this period, where we can. Sometimes we may have to contact you about something that is not related to fundraising or marketing. For example, if you have a direct debit with us, we are required to let you know about any changes to your direct debit. Opting out of postal communications will not stop this type of communication unless you cancel your direct debit. If you have any concerns about this type of contact, please get in touch with us.

<p>We are committed to respecting the privacy rights of all donors and visitors to our website. The following information details Mercy Corps' collection, protection, and use of the data we receive from donors and visitors to this website.

</p><p></p><h2>Our General Policy</h2>

<p>Mercy Corps recognizes the importance of protecting information we may collect from donors and visitors to our site. We maintain appropriate security measures to keep this information private.

</p><p>If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet for the purposes of correspondence, processing a donation or subscribing to our email newsletter, then it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information.

</p><p>Mercy Corps will remove your name from our mailing list, email list or telephone solicitation list at any time, at your request. We will not sell, rent or trade your email address to a third party.

</p><h3>Email Updates</h3>

<p>We use a third-party email marketing platform to deliver emails. This company employs techniques for tracking open rates and click-throughs that use email address as an identifier.

</p><p>You will be given the option to remove your name from our email list at the bottom of each email update. And, again, we will not sell, rent or trade your email address to a third party.

</p><h3>Online Donations</h3>

<p>Our online donation processor meets the highest industry standards and guidelines for PCI compliance, utilizing high-grade encryption to ensure secure transactions.

</p><p>Independent external and internal audits ensure the privacy, security and appropriate processing of your information on our site.

</p><p><b><a href="/about-us/donor-pledge">Read our seven promises to donors here.</a></b>

</p><p></p><h3>Use of Third-Party Software and Advertising Services</h3>

<p>We also use third-party services to better understand the needs of people who visit our site. These services tell us information about technical aspects of our visitors' computers and some demographic information. We use this information to improve our content and structure, leading to a better user experience.

</p><p>We do not receive or request any personally identifiable information from you unless you provide it.

</p><p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <b><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here.</a></b>

</p><p></p><h3>Spam filter</h3>

<p>To help us filter out spam we use a service called <b><a href="http://drupal.org/project/honeypot" target="_blank">Honeypot</a></b>, and <b><a href="http://akismet.com" target="_blank">Akismet</a></b>. For more information about those filters, please follow the links to each.

</p><h3>Donations by Mail</h3>
 
<p>In order to increase our base of support and keep our costs low, Mercy Corps sometimes exchanges a segment of our mailing list with other carefully selected organizations. Donors who make their first gift to Mercy Corps in response to an appeal letter may be included on this exchange list; all other donors are automatically excluded from the exchange. All donors who made their first gift to Mercy Corps before January 31, 2004 are also excluded from the exchange. At least once a year, we will inform all donors who are eligible to be included on the exchange list, and give them an opportunity to opt out of future exchanges. Donors who wish to have their names removed from the exchange list can call 1-888-842-0842 or email donorservices@mercycorps.org.

</p><h3>State Registrations</h3>

<p><b><a href="/about-us/privacy-policy/state-nonprofit-disclosures">Click here</a></b> to see our state registrations.

</p><p>If you would have additional questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us via email at donorservices@mercycorps.org or 1-888-842-0842.
