  PRIVACY POLICY
  <br><br>
  Last updated on May 3, 2013
  <br><br>
  Our Privacy Policy is designed to provide clarity about the information we collect and how we use it to provide a better user experience. By accepting our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service in registration, you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us as described in Section 12 (“Contact Us”).
  <br><br>
  1.  INTRODUCTION
  <br><br>
  CopThis operates applications for mobile devices and CopThis branded websites (the “Service”). In this policy, “CopThis” refers to CopThis, Inc. and its Affiliates, which means subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership. We may also refer to CopThis as “we” or “us”.
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy describes:
  the information we collect, how we do so and the purposes of our collection
  how we use and with whom we share such information
  how you can access and update such information
  the choices you can make about how we collect, use and share your information
  how we protect the information we store about you
  <br><br>
  2.  INFORMATION WE COLLECT
  <br><br>
  When you interact with the Service, via any CopThis mobile application, at www.copthis.com, or any CopThis-owned or Affiliate-owned website, we may collect and store information from you directly as described below:
  <br><br>
  2.1  Registration Information
  <br><br>
  We may allow you to “register” with us to create an account or profile within the Service. In the registration process you may be required to provide the following information: your age or birthday (for age screening and/or to better understand who our users are); your first and last names; your e-mail address; a password and other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account.
  <br>
  We may also offer you the option to complete a user profile that is visible to other CopThis users. Your user profile may include: a profile photo; one or more usernames; your gender; biographic details that you provide; links to your profiles on various social networking sites; and a CopThis user ID number that is created by CopThis and used to identify your profile.
  <br>
  The CopThis user ID number used to identify your account and profile will be public and will appear in the URL of your profile page, but will only permit access to information that is considered public or that you have designated as public in your settings.
  <br>
  Your first and last names and profile picture are considered “public” on CopThis websites and search engines may index this publicly available information. When we offer profiles, we may also offer functionality that allows you to opt-out of public indexing of your public profile information.
  <br>
  2.2  Information We Receive or Collect When You Use the Service on a Mobile Device
  <br>
  If you access the Service from your mobile telephone or other mobile device, including iPads and tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers, including MAC Address, and IP Address. We may create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number. We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name or e-mail address. We may also collect geo-location information each time you access the Service from a mobile device unless you have disabled the geo-location feature in the device settings.
  <br><br>
  2.3  Payment Information
  <br><br>
  If you make a purchase in connection with the Service, we will collect the billing and financial information necessary to process your charges, which may include your postal and e-mail addresses. CopThis may also receive the billing and payment information that you provide when your purchase is processed by another party.
  <br><br>
  2.4  Customer Support Correspondence
  <br><br>
  When you ask for assistance from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the contact information you provide (generally your name and e-mail address), information about your activity on the Service, and your user ID number. We will also store the correspondence and any information contained within.
  <br><br>
  2.5  SMS Notifications, Push Notifications &amp; Local Notifications
  <br><br>
  We receive and store the information you provide, including your telephone number, when you sign up to have SMS notifications sent directly to your mobile phone. You can adjust the types of notifications you receive and when you receive them by editing your SMS notification settings.
  <br>
  With your consent we may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide updates and other relevant messages. You can manage push notifications from the “options” or “settings” page. You may also be able to manage them from your device’s settings page for the Service.
  <br><br>
  2.6  Technical and Usage Information
  <br><br>
  When you access our websites or the Service, we collect (i) certain technical information about your mobile device or computer system, including MAC Address, IP Address and mobile device ID; and (ii) usage statistics about your interactions with the Service. This information is typically collected through the use of server log files or web log files (“Log Files”), mobile device software development kits and tracking technologies like browser cookies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information. Some of the cookies the Service places on your computer are linked to your user ID number(s). For more information on how we utilize cookies and other tracking technologies please review the “Cookies and Automated Information Collection” portion of Section 3 (“How we Collect Information about You”).
  <br><br>
  3.  HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
  <br><br>
  We may collect information about you in any one or more of the following ways:
  <br><br>
  3.1  Information about Users
  <br><br>
  When you use the Service, CopThis collects and stores certain information that you provide directly or through a third party website. We may also collect information about your interaction with other users of the Service. The bulk of this information is collected and stored through the use of Log Files, which are files on our web servers that record actions taken on our websites.
  <br><br>
  3.2  Communications Features
  <br><br>
  You may be able to take part in certain activities on our websites or by using the Service that give you the opportunity to communicate or share information not just with CopThis, but also with other users of our Service.
  <br>
  We may record and store archives of these communications on our servers to protect the safety and well being of our users and our rights and property in connection with the service. You acknowledge and consent to the recording and storage of such communications for these purposes.
  <br><br>
  3.3  Cookies and Automated Information Collection
  <br><br>
  When you access the Service, we collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and services; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; and (iii) manage advertising. We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, use Log Files and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information, including cookies, IP addresses, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of activity on our websites, and other similar information. In some cases, we will associate this information with your user ID number for our internal use.
  <br>
  We may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your in-Service preferences and speed up load times.
  <br>
  You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of the Service, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your activities within the Service.
  <br><br>
  4.  HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
  <br><br>
  In general, we collect, store and use your information to provide you with a safe, efficient, and customized experience. For example, we may use information collected from you in any one or more of the following ways:
  <br>
  to create your user accounts
  <br>
  to identify and suggest connections with other users
  <br>
  to enable user-to-user communications
  <br>
  to provide technical support and respond to user inquiries
  <br>
  to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Service
  <br>
  to deliver and target advertising
  <br>
  to notify users of updates
  <br>
  to solicit feedback to improve CopThis products and services and customize your user experience
  <br>
  to inform users about new products or promotional offers
  <br>
  One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to CopThis, we’ll use it to respond to (i) customer support inquiries, and (ii) keep you informed of your activity within the Service. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages (“Promotional Communications”) directly or in partnership with parties other than CopThis. Each Promotional Communication will generally offer recipients choices about receiving additional messages.
  <br><br>
  5.  SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION
  <br><br>
  We will share your information (in some cases personal information) with third parties, that is parties other than CopThis, in the following circumstances:
  <br><br>
  5.1  Third-Party Service Providers
  <br><br>
  We will provide your information to third-party companies to perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, product delivery, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to assist us in our marketing efforts.

  5.2  Other Users
  <br><br>
  The Service supports and may encourage interaction among users. Other users may see your name, profile and descriptions of your activity.
  <br><br>
  5.3  Advertising of Third-Party Products and Services
  <br><br>
  We may share personal information, including your email address, with third-party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes.
  <br>
  We may also share (i) aggregated information (information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you); (ii) anonymous information; and (iii) certain technical information (including IP Addresses, MAC Addresses for mobile devices and mobile device IDs) to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Service and on the websites of third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect these types of information within the Service and they may share it with us. Advertisers may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience).
  <br>
  Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous or aggregated information are not subject to any of the restrictions in this Privacy Policy.
  <br><br>
  5.4  Safety, Security and Compliance with Law
  <br><br>
  Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications (including without limitation chat text, voice communications, IP addresses and your personal information) may be accessed and monitored as necessary to provide the Service and may be disclosed: (i) when we have a good faith belief that we are required to disclose the information in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to satisfy any applicable laws or regulations (iii) where we believe that the Service is being used in the commission of a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; (iv) when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally; and (v) in order to protect the rights or property of CopThis, including to enforce our Terms of Service.

  5.5  Sale or Merger
  <br><br>
  In the event that CopThis undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in such transition. If material changes to our privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, we will notify you and other users of the business transition prior to transferring your personal information.
  <br><br>
  6.  OUR POLICIES CONCERNING CHILDREN
  <br><br>
  Our Service is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from such children. Children under the age of 13 should not use our websites or the Service at any time. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records.

  9.  PRIVACY POLICIES OF LINKED SITES AND ADVERTISERS
  <br><br>
  Our websites may contain advertisements from companies other than CopThis that may link to their own websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

  <br><br>
  10.  SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
  <br><br>
  CopThis implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer information.
  <br>
  For user accounts registered with CopThis, profile information is protected by the password each member uses to access their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your CopThis account, the website allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”).
  <br>
  While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our websites and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use.
  <br>
  Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access.
  <br><br>
  11.  CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
  <br><br>
  We may make P3P – compact machine-readable – policies and headers available. If we do so, we will try to ensure that they are consistent with this human readable policy. However, in the event of a conflict between a machine-readable policy and this policy, this (human readable policy will control.
  <br>
  If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you and other users by placing a notice on our website or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you. You should periodically check www.copthis.com and this privacy page for updates.
