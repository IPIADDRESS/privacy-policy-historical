            <h3>Privacy Policy - Effective Date of December 1, 2004</h3>
            Mercedes Homes, Inc. respects your privacy. That's why we have this Privacy Statement to explain how and why we collect certain information online, and how we use that information. Mercedes Homes will not knowingly share information provided by you with anyone other than its subsidiaries except as required or permitted by applicable law. We do not sell our names or lists. However, viewers should note that while it is our intent to hold private the information you transmit via our website or by way of an internet electronic mail system or service, Mercedes Homes cannot promise or ensure that such information will remain confidential or secure.

            <p>We may share information about you, as a current or former customer, within our Mercedes Homes 
            family of companies in order to provide you with better service and information about financial or 
            other products that may interest you. For example, we may share transaction and account experience 
            information about you within our family of companies. However, we do not share personal financial 
            information obtained from applications or credit reports with another Mercedes Homes company unless 
            it is helping us respond to your request or service your existing relationship with us, such as 
            helping us evaluate your application or review your existing loan.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sharing of personal information with third parties</strong></p>
            
            <p>Individuals or companies outside of the Mercedes Homes, Inc. family of companies are considered 
            third parties. Mortgage lenders are permitted (and sometimes even required) to share customer 
            information with third parties for certain purposes, such as servicing customer relationships, 
            fraud and risk management, and responding to transaction requests.  We may share personal 
            information with a third party company in order to offer or support a product or service that 
            we provide to you. For example, we share payment information with the third party service 
            provider that creates monthly statements for us.  We also share personal information as legally 
            required. We may share personal information with law enforcement agencies or other third parties to 
            prevent or investigate suspected fraudulent activities.  We also provide personal information 
            regarding our customers' accounts to credit bureaus for credit reporting purposes. </p>
