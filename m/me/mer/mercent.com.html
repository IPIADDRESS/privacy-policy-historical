<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Commerce Technologies, LLC dba CommerceHub, located at 201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor, Albany, NY 12203, United States of America (“<span class="term">CommerceHub</span>”, “<span class="term">we</span>”, “<span class="term">us</span>”, or “<span class="term">our</span>”) is a trusted partner to the clients we serve to help them power their engines of e-commerce, and we value that trust. This privacy policy (the “<span class="term">Policy</span>”) describes how we collect and use information, and the choices we provide with respect to our collection and use of information. This Policy applies to information collected (1) through the services we provide; (2) through websites owned by CommerceHub and its wholly owned subsidiaries including CommerceHub (UK) Ltd.; (3) through our client portals (including those for our offerings such as OrderStream, ProductStream and DemandStream); (4) through any other websites, applications, widgets, services, and interactive properties linking to this Policy or on which this Policy appears (each, a “<span class="term">Property</span>“), regardless of how accessed or used; (5) and through email, electronic newsletters and other online means.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Policy, “personal information” means information that personally identifies a data subject. In addition to other types of information, CommerceHub collects business contact information from users of its Properties, products and services. To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, business contact information does not constitute personal information.</p>
<p>Please read this Policy carefully. To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, your use of this Property and/or CommerceHub’s services and technology indicates your consent to this Policy and to CommerceHub’s use, collection, transmission and processing of data and information you or others provide to CommerceHub, in each case, in the manner described herein. If you disagree with the way we collect and process information, do not use this Property.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="personal-information"></a></p>
<h3>Personal Information We Collect</h3>
<p><em>Order Data</em>. Our retailer and merchant clients and their suppliers, and the marketplaces, carriers, marketing channels, and other third-party providers with whom they work (each, a “<span class="term">Participant</span>”) use our services to establish connections for the exchange and analysis of information relating to their e-commerce operations and transactions. Participants provide us with information regarding orders transmitted to or received from or for their customers and trading partners, including sufficient personal information to ship orders to customers (“<span class="term">Order Data</span>”). We organize that Order Data and transmit it to other Participants so they can fulfill or process those orders (including returns and order cancellations). Examples of the type of personal information in an Order Data record include, but are not limited to, a consumer’s name, e-mail address, physical address, phone number and items ordered.</p>
<p>CommerceHub acts as a service provider to Participants, and is neither the seller of record, merchant of record, nor fulfiller of products sold to consumers. CommerceHub does not process consumer payments or handle any consumer payment account information, nor is it subject to PCI rules.</p>
<p><em>Information Provided by You</em>. We collect personal information provided to us by visitors to and users of our Properties, including but not limited to through the use of our client portals; through requests to receive information from us; by completing a registration through a Property such as for a webinar; through comments on our blogs; and through contact with customer service. Examples of the type of personal information we collect include but are not limited to name, e-mail address, company address, and phone number. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all personal information you provide to us. We use third-party tools to collect information from current and prospective users of our services, which may include personal information, but primarily consists of business contact information.</p>
<p><em>Information Provided by Social Networking Providers</em>. If you “like,” “share,” or post comments to CommerceHub content through a social networking provider, the provider may share information about you with us such as your public profile, e-mail address and friend list and may publicly display this information in connection with our account. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of your social networking providers and your privacy settings through that provider. If you post information on a social networking or third-party service that references CommerceHub or its products or services (e.g., via a Twitter hashtag), your post may be cross-published on our Property or through our social media account.</p>
<p><em>Information from Third-party Services</em>. We use third-party services to update or supplement personal information in our systems, such as to validate or update address information. We may also receive information from our service providers engaged to collect and/or process information on our behalf; for more information, see the “<a href="#service-providers">Service Providers and Onward Transfer</a>” section below.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="information-collected"></a></p>
<h3>Information Collected Through Access and Use of Our Properties</h3>
<p>We, our Participants, and our third-party service providers use cookies, tracking pixels (also known as web beacons), embedded scripts, and similar web technologies (collectively, “<span class="term">Web Technologies</span>“). These Web Technologies are used to provide our services and operate our Properties; to associate traffic to or from a Participant’s website with an order sent through our systems; and to analyze the use of, and to improve, our Properties and services. The type of non-personal information we collect through Web Technologies includes the areas of our Property visited, the services and functionality accessed, duration of such access and information about the web browser and/or device used.</p>
<p><em>Web Browser or Device Information</em>. We and our service providers collect information sent by your web browser or device, including your IP address, geolocation, browser and operating system type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. The information received depends on the settings on your web browser or device. Please review the settings of your web browser or device if you want to learn and change what information is sent by your browser or device. If you access a Property through a mobile device or application, certain of your information may be shared with the mobile carrier or application provider.</p>
<p><em>“Do Not Track” Headers</em>. “Do Not Track” (DNT) is a web browser setting which lets the websites you visit know that you do not want them collecting information about you. We do not respond to DNT settings or signals.</p>
<p><em>Analytics Providers</em>. We may use analytics information collected through third-party services, such as Google Analytics, to better understand the manner in which Participants and their users access and use our Properties, including without limitation for reporting, maintenance and development/enhancement purposes. You can manage how Google Analytics collects information about you as described in the “<a href="#your-choices">Your Choices</a>” section of this Policy.</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em>. We may place one or more cookies or other similar tracking technology on your computer. A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer’s hard drive by a web server. Some cookies are used to assist you with your session on our Property. Depending on the cookie, the cookie may expire at the end of your browser session or may stay (or “persist”) on your computer until the expiration date specified in the cookie. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies can only be accessed or read by the Internet domain (generally a web site) that placed them. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies as further described in the “<a href="#your-choices">Your Choices</a>” section below. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use certain features of our Property that depend on your web browser accepting cookies.</p>
<p><em>Web Beacons</em>. We use small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs,” “clear GIFs,” “single-pixel GIFs,” “pixel tags,” “JavaScript tags,” “web bugs,” and “action tags”) on a Property or in our email communications. We use web beacons for a number of purposes, such as to track browser types, to track the search terms and domain names that bring visitors to our Property, to count visitors to a Property, to monitor how users navigate a Property, and to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or how many particular links or content elements were actually viewed.</p>
<p><em>Embedded Scripts</em>. We use embedded scripts, which is programming code designed to collect information about how visitors interact with a Property, such as identifying the website that referred and linked the visitor to a Property and the manner in which they use a Property. Embedded scripts are downloaded onto your device’s cache from our web server or a third-party service provider and are deactivated or deleted following the end of your session once your browser cache is cleared.</p>

<p>In addition, we use personal information (including Order Data) to generate anonymous data, by either (a) using it to generate anonymous transaction and performance data, or (b) “de-identifying” it to remove any information that identifies a person specifically, and use the resulting anonymous data and information (“<span class="term">Anonymized Data</span>”) for the purposes set forth above.</p>
<p><em>To Comply with Legal Requirements and Protect You, CommerceHub and Others</em>. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may disclose information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with local or national security, law enforcement, or regulatory processes, requirements or orders; to cooperate formally or informally with law enforcement or other governmental investigations; to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce a contract; to protect the legal rights, property, or safety of CommerceHub, its corporate affiliates, and their respective employees, clients, partners and agents, other users or the public in general; to protect the security of CommerceHub’s systems, and the data and information we process or control; or to protect your vital interests if determined necessary by us. In addition, from time to time we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs – which may contain visitors’ IP addresses – with the appropriate investigative authorities who use that information to trace and identify individuals. We also reserve the right, without notice, to report to appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe are in violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations.</p>
<p><em>In Connection with Corporate Events</em>. If one of our corporate affiliates or a third party has acquired all or part of our business, specific assets or the business of one of our operating divisions through which you have provided information to us, e.g., as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution, liquidation or distribution, ownership of our records and data (including your personal information within them) will be transferred to that successor company. In that event, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be governed by this Policy and any privacy preferences you have expressed to us.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" name="privacy-shield"></a></p>
<h3>US-EU Privacy Shield and Consent to Transfer Information to the United States</h3>
<p>CommerceHub complies with the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from individuals in European Union member Countries. CommerceHub has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Privacy Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Privacy Principles, the Privacy Shield Privacy Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has jurisdiction over CommerceHub’s compliance with the Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>CommerceHub’s servers are located in the United States and we may also locate servers in the United Kingdom or the European Union. If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including personal information, may be transferred to, processed in, and stored in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, be aware that data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your personal information can be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States in accordance with and subject to the laws of the United States. By using a Property or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States. You are also consenting to the application of United States federal and New York state law in all matters concerning the Property and this Policy.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="service-providers"></a></p>
<h3>Service Providers and Onward Transfer</h3>
<p>We use third-party service providers to perform and provide certain services in connection with our business, such as but not limited to verifying and validating information, hosting all or part of Properties, providing usage analytics, sending communications, customer support, log storage, providing marketing assistance and data analysis, and providing other administrative services. We provide service providers access to information only for the purpose of carrying out services on our behalf. Information provided through a portion of a Property that is hosted by a CommerceHub service provider may be stored on the systems of our service provider and processed by that service provider in accordance with our agreement with that services provider.</p>
<p>We may provide personal information to service providers that act as our agent, consultant, or contractor to perform tasks on behalf of and under our instructions. For example, we may store personal information in the facilities operated by a service provider or use a third-party provider to perform data analysis. Such service providers must agree to use such personal information only for the purposes for which they have been engaged by CommerceHub, and they must either:</p>
<ul>
<li>comply with the Privacy Shield principles or another mechanism permitted by the applicable EU data protection law(s) for transfers and processing of Personal Data, or</li>
<li>agree to provide adequate protections for the personal information that are no less protective than those set out in this Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the US-EU Privacy Shield, CommerceHub is liable for its onward transfer of personal information to its service providers.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="third-party"></a></p>
<h3>Third-party Content and Links</h3>
<p>A link on one of our Properties to a third-party website does not imply our endorsement of that website, advertiser or product. We do not control the websites to which we may link, including without limitation Participant websites, and we assume no responsibility for their content or privacy policies. Any information that you provide to linked websites or other third parties is provided directly to such third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. Therefore, you should carefully review the privacy policies that apply to any websites you access.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="data-integrity"></a></p>
<h3>Data Integrity and Security</h3>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that we collect only personal information that is relevant to our provision of our services, and we process your personal information in a manner that is compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or provided to us. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure your personal information is usable for its intended purpose and remains accurate, complete and current.</p>
<p>We keep personal information for the purposes for which it was originally collected (or to which you have subsequently consented) and for other legitimate purposes (such as regulatory compliance), as permitted or required by applicable law.</p>
<p>We have implemented reasonable and appropriate safeguards, security technologies and procedures designed to protect personal information from unauthorized loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. It is important that you understand, however, that no website, application, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.”</p>
