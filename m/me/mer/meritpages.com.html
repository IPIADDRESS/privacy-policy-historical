        <p>
        Merit Pages, Inc.  (referred to herein as "meritpages.com," "we," "us, or "our") is committed to providing its online profile users with services and information in an efficient and secure manner. This privacy policy explains what personal information is collected on meritpages.com and from users of Merit Pages, Inc.’s various online services (collectively, the “Profile”), how that information is used and what measures Merit Pages, Inc. takes to safeguard its users’ privacy.
        </p>
        <h3>What personal information is collected through the Profile?</h3>
        <p>
        When you claim or create a Merit Pages, Inc. account, you provide some or all of the following information: name, user-name, password, and email address. Some of this information, including your name and user-name, may be listed publicly on the Profile, such as on your profile page and in the search results. Some services of the Profile, including general browsing, do not require registration. You may also provide additional information that you would like to be made public on your profile page, such as biographical information, your location, and photos. Your profile page will also include public directory information such as your hometown, college, major and year of graduation, if applicable, which is provided by third-parties, such as colleges, universities and public agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Please note</strong> that by voluntarily providing us with this personal information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Does Merit Pages, Inc. provide personal information collected through the Profile to third parties?</h3>
        <p>
        Merit Pages, Inc. does not sell, trade or rent personal information collected online and will not knowingly disclose any individual personal information to third parties except as follows:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:decimal;">
          <li><span class="underline">Non-private or Non-Personal Information.</span> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public bio and the information displayed in your profile.</li>
          <li><span class="underline">With your Consent.</span> We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your Merit Pages, Inc. account.</li>
          <li><span class="underline">Related Third Parties.</span> In order to provide you with requested services, Merit Pages, Inc. may provide contact or other necessary information to affiliated sites for syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of your information.</li>
          <li><span class="underline">Legal Action.</span> When disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with the rights (including property rights) or safety of other users or third parties or of Merit Pages, Inc..</li>
          <li><span class="underline">Compliance with Law.</span> When Merit Pages, Inc. reasonably believes that disclosure is required by law or to comply with legal process served on Merit Pages, Inc..</li>
          <li><span class="underline">Terms of Service.</span> In order to enforce our Terms of Service.</li>

        </ul>    
        <em><strong>How can I change or update the information I provide through the Profile?</strong></em>
        <p>
        For Profile services and products, where user profile information is collected and stored in order to provide you with requested services, Merit Pages, Inc. offers you the opportunity to change or update your profile information at any time by visiting the “My Account” section of the Profile.
        </p>
        <em><strong>Does the Profile use cookies (information that the computer that hosts our Profile gives to your browser when you access the Profile)?</strong></em>
        <p>
        The Profile may use cookies, however Merit Pages, Inc. will only use cookies to facilitate functions of the Profile and to analyze Profile usage and will not record or store any information about your movements on the Internet outside of your use of the Profile. For example, the Profile may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Profile without needing to remember and enter a password more than once during a visit to the Profile. Please note that if you click on a link to a third-party website from the Profile, the linked-to site may have different policies and practices with regard to cookies and Merit Pages, Inc. has no control over and is not responsible for such policies or practices. You should always consult the privacy policy governing any website you visit on the Internet for complete information about their policies and practices.
        </p>
        <em><strong>What measures does Merit Pages, Inc. take to safeguard its online users’ privacy?</strong></em>
        <p>
        Information you submit to Merit Pages, Inc. upon registration for specific services is password-protected so that the only parties who have access to the information besides Merit Pages, Inc. and its agents and affiliates are you and those you provide that information to. In order to protect the integrity of the password system, members and profile users should refrain from disclosing passwords and immediately change any passwords that may have been compromised. Merit Pages, Inc. will never ask you for your password by e-mail, so members and their employees should not respond to unsolicited e-mail requests asking for password information even if such requests appear to be from Merit Pages, Inc..
        </p>
        <p>
        Please be advised that no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Merit Pages, Inc. is committed to protecting users’ personal information, but cannot guarantee or warrant the security of this information when it is sent to or through the Profile. Transmission of such information is therefore at the risk of the user.
