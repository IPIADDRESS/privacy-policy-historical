    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        meritpages.com is committed to providing its online profile users with services and information in an efficient and secure manner.  This privacy policy explains what personal information is collected on meritpages.com and from users of meritpages.com’s various online services (collectively, the “Profile”), how that information is used and what measures meritpages.com takes to safeguard its users’ privacy.

    </p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        When you interact with meritpages.com through the Profile, we receive and store non-identifiable information, which is collected passively using various techniques, but cannot presently be used to specifically identify you.  This information may be aggregated to better understand the demographics and behaviors of our profile users.  For example, meritpages.com tracks aggregate anonymous statistics regarding usage of the Profile and may provide this anonymous information to members, affiliates, advertisers and for other lawful purposes.
    </p>
    <em><strong>Does meritpages.com provide personal information collected through the Profile to third parties?</strong></em>
    <p>
        meritpages.com does not sell, trade or rent personal information collected online and will not knowingly disclose any individual personal information to third parties except as follows:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:decimal;">
        <li><span class="underline">Non-private or Non-Personal Information.</span>  We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public bio and the information displayed in your profile.</li>
        <li><span class="underline">With your Consent.</span>  We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your meritpages.com account.</li>

        <li><span class="underline">Legal Action.</span> When disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with the rights (including property rights) or safety of other users or third parties or of meritpages.com.</li>
        <li><span class="underline">Compliance with Law.</span> When meritpages.com reasonably believes that disclosure is required by law or to comply with legal process served on meritpages.com.</li>
        <li><span class="underline">Terms of Service.</span> In order to enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
        <li><span class="underline">Business Transfers.</span> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.  In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal information may be part of the transferred assets.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong><em>How can I change or update the information I provide through the Profile?</em></strong>
    <p>
        For Profile services and products, where user profile information is collected and stored in order to provide you with requested services, meritpages.com offers you the opportunity to change or update your profile information at any time by visiting the “My Account” section of the Profile.
    </p>
    <strong><em>Does the Profile use cookies (information that the computer that hosts our Profile gives to your browser when you access the Profile)?</em></strong>
    <p>
        The Profile may use cookies, however meritpages.com will only use cookies to facilitate functions of the Profile and to analyze Profile usage and will not record or store any information about your movements on the Internet outside of your use of the Profile.  For example, the Profile may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Profile without needing to remember and enter a password more than once during a visit to the Profile.  Please note that if you click on a link to a third-party website from the Profile, the linked-to site may have different policies and practices with regard to cookies and meritpages.com has no control over and is not responsible for such policies or practices. You should always consult the privacy policy governing any website you visit on the Internet for complete information about their policies and practices.
    </p>
    <strong><em>What measures does meritpages.com take to safeguard its online users’ privacy?</em></strong>
    <p>
        Information you submit to meritpages.com upon registration for specific services is password-protected so that the only parties who have access to the information besides meritpages.com and its agents and affiliates are you and those you provide that information to.  In order to protect the integrity of the password system, members and profile users should refrain from disclosing passwords and immediately change any passwords that may have been compromised. meritpages.com will never ask you for your password by e-mail, so members and their employees should not respond to unsolicited e-mail requests asking for password information even if such requests appear to be from meritpages.com.
    </p>
    <p>

Transmission of such information is therefore at the risk of the user.
