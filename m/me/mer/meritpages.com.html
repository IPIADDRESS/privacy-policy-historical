    <p>
      Information you submit to Merit Pages, Inc. upon registration for specific services is password-protected so that the only parties who have access to the information besides Merit Pages, Inc. and its agents and affiliates are you and those you provide that information to. In order to protect the integrity of the password system, members and profile users should refrain from disclosing passwords and immediately change any passwords that may have been compromised.
