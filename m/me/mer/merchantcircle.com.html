We believe you should be able to share and collaborate on our platform in a secure, hosted environment.</p>
		  <p>Because we want you to understand the collections and uses of data that are necessary and possible on the MerchantCircle platform, and to show our respect for your privacy and security, we have established this privacy and security policy. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification of any material change at least thirty (30) days prior to the change taking effect. You may contact us with any questions pertaining to this policy at <a href="mailto:privacy@merchantcircle.com">privacy@merchantcircle.com</a>.</p>
		  
		  <h4>Collected Information</h4>

		  <p>In the registration process, we collect registration information from our users, including name, user name, and password, contact information such as email, address and telephone number, and billing information such as credit card number. Each of these different types of information is used to provide the MerchantCircle service. Registration information is used to authenticate users and recall their merchant sites, contact information is used to provide information on service updates, and billing information is used to charge for our services.</p>
