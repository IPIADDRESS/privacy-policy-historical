		<h1>MerchantCircle Privacy and Security Policy</h1>
		<p>At MerchantCircle we provide the intelligent connection of customers with neighborhood businesses. Whether you are a consumer seeking a deal or a merchant trying to acquire or keep customers, we want to keep offering you outstanding value so that you continue to use our services. We believe you should be able to share and collaborate on our platform in a secure hosted environment.</p>
		<p>Because we want you to understand the collections and uses of data that are necessary and possible on the MerchantCircle platform, and to show our respect for your privacy, we have established this privacy policy. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification of any material change via a posting to the merchantcircle.com website. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. You may contact us with any questions pertaining to this policy at <a href="mailto:privacy@merchantcircle.com">privacy@merchantcircle.com</a>.</p>
		<h4>Collected Information</h4>
		<p>In the registration process, we collect registration information from our users, including name, user name, and password, contact information such as email, address and telephone number, and billing information such as credit card number. Each of these different types of information is used to provide the MerchantCircle service. Registration information is used to authenticate users and recall their merchant sites, contact information is used to provide information on service updates, and billing information is used to charge for our services.</p>
		<p>In the operation of the MerchantCircle service, we collect and store merchant and consumer information in order to provide couponing and other connection services. This data is gathered from a variety of sources and enables us to prepare merchant sites, provide services to consumers with minimal data entry, and verify that sites are validly controlled by those who claim to represent businesses. MerchantCircle will continue to make your data available to you on the MerchantCircle platform as long as you are a user according to the terms and conditions of the MerchantCircle Terms of Service. Please consult that agreement as well as this policy to understand your rights and responsibilities as a user of the MerchantCircle platform.</p>
		<p>MerchantCircle may also collect and analyze from visitors and users certain information regarding the use of MerchantCircle's services and MerchantCircle site activity. Information collected may include but is not limited to web site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser and operating system, etc. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, administer the site, and improve the quality and types of service delivered. We may provide non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information derived from the actions of our visitors and customers to third parties in order to demonstrate the value we deliver to users.</p>
		<h4>Shared Information</h4>
		<p>We may share your personal or business information as described below:</p>
		<p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may operate stores at our website, sell items to you through the website or offer you products or services that may be of interest to you. In other situations, MerchantCircle may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a particular opportunity or transaction, and we will share user information that is related to such opportunity or transaction with that affiliated business.</p>
		<p>Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, and providing user services. Unless we tell you differently, MerchantCircle's agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>

You may also, from time-to-time, receive promotional emails from MerchantCircle partners.  Please see the “Communication Preferences” section below for details.</p>
		<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if MerchantCircle, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that MerchantCircle goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of MerchantCircle may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy.</p>
		<p>Protection of MerchantCircle and Others: We may release personal and business information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of MerchantCircle, our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>
