        <h3>Mercury's Use of Your Personal Information</h3>
      <p>We treat your information with respect and concern for your privacy. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted or required by law.</p>

        <h3>Independent Mercury Agents</h3>
      <p>The independent insurance agents authorized to sell Mercury products and services are not Mercury employees, but they are subject to Mercury's Privacy Policy, to the extent that they sell or service our products, unless they have provided you with a copy of their own privacy policy. Because they have a unique business relationship with you, they may have additional personal information about you that Mercury does not. They may use this information differently than Mercury. Contact your Mercury Agent or advisor to learn more about their privacy practices.</p>
