<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

<p><u>Tracking Technology.</u> MergerNetwork logs IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Site. We may track your movement within the Site, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. We only use this information in aggregate and do not link it to you personally unless you opt in as a subscriber. To gauge the effectiveness of our Site, we do collect some generic information about our visitors. Our web servers automatically recognize a visitor's domain name, the web page from which a visitor enters our Site, which pages a visitor visits on our Site, and how much time a visitor spends on each page. We may use anonymous tracking technologies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical purposes and to improve the products and services we provide. We aggregate this information and use it to evaluate and improve our Site. We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources for instance to verify your address or update your information and to create a "profile" of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information to information in the profile, in order to improve the content of the Site for you. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this Site. We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies are used to differentiate registered users from non-registered users, to differentiate logged-in users from non-logged-in users, to customize the content of certain sections of the website, to enable us to track and target the interests of our users, and to enhance the experience on our Site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site may be limited.</p>

We encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our Site but participation is entirely voluntary.</p>

This contact information is then shared with the users who have business listings that match their search criteria. Any information you post is public information and we cannot control what uses third parties may make of personal information you share in such a public forum. In addition, users searching the Site can view contact information (name, email and phone number) when they view a listing profile. Users can save their search criteria to have information about properties that match the specified criteria placed in their mailbox or emailed to them. Search criterion and activity remains private to the individual user.</p>
