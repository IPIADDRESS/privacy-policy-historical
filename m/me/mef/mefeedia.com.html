                            <p><strong>OUR BUSINESS</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Beachfront Media, LLC has a technology platform.</strong></p>
                            <p>We use our proprietary technology to offer advertising solutions to our clients, which includes working with advertisers to deliver their advertising campaigns across our network of publishers and application (“app”) developers (our “Platform”).</p>
                            <p>We offer products and services that help online publishers, agencies, and ad networks manage and deliver online advertising. We also own websites, and offer technology that allows content providers to place their content into applications. As a consumer, when you see an advertisement before you watch a video, or read content on a web page or an app, we may help deliver that ad from or for an advertiser to the website or application that has made the content available to you. We also provide a marketplace, where buyers and sellers of online advertising space can connect and do business.</p>
                            <p>We are not in the business of collecting, using, or selling consumer data; however we do offer technologies to advertisers and publishers that allows them to sell and purchase space or digital advertisements to try and ensure that the audience they desire sees their ads and that the advertising itself is delivered and the performance of the advertising can be analyzed. Types of data that may be used for this purpose range from behavioral or interest-related information to geographical or demographic user data, with limits to EU Users&nbsp; please see GDPR section for details. &nbsp;We adhere to the NAI Code of Conduct.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND HOW IT IS COLLECTED</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Personally-Identifiable Information.</strong></p>
                            <p>We do not collect personally-identifiable information in order to help our clients buy, sell, and deliver online advertising. “Personally-Identifiable Information” means information that alone or when in combination with other information we collect, may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you. There may be some opportunities, for example when you use this Site, where you may choose to enter your name, contact information, and other personal details. For example, if you were interested in becoming one of our clients or using our Services you could provide us with contact details through our Site.</p>
                            <p>Where we collect personally-identifiable information you will have clear notification of what we are doing so that you can choose not to provide it.</p>
                            <p><strong>Non-Personally-Identifiable Information.</strong></p>
                            <p>Non-personally-identifiable information is information that, without additional information, cannot be linked to a specific individual by us. We may collect non-personally-identifiable information while you are visiting our Site or the website of one of our advertisers or Web publishers (collectively, “”customers”). For example, while providing the Services to website publishers, advertisers and those working for them, we may collect your IP address, Web pages that you visit, the time and date, and whether or not you clicked on various advertisements (collectively, “Web Surfing Data”). We understand that under GDPR definitions for personally identifiable information differs from the US. Please see the Internal Visitors and GDPR section for more information.</p>

                            <p>Use of Non-Personally-Identifiable Information. The non-personally-identifiable data that we and/or our customers collect when using the Services are used for marketing and sales efforts and to better target advertisements to people across the different websites they visit. We may also use the non-personally-identifiable data that it collects to better target content to individuals in an effort to create a personally relevant experience for each person. The non-personally identifiable data is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals.</p>
                            <p><strong>Use of Personally-Identifiable Information </strong></p>
                            <p>We use personally-identifiable information we receive primarily to communicate with our customers as we provide the Services. We use information we receive from business customer prospects in the same ways.</p>

                            <p><strong>Data from Customers</strong></p>
                            <p>We allow our customers to import data that they have collected or purchased to deliver advertisements to certain audiences through the Services. We are not responsible for and do not control the collection of this data. If you wish to opt out of collection of your information by third parties, then you must do so directly with those third parties.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

If a visitor to our Site provides personally-identifiable information as part of an inquiry about products or services provided by us, we will provide that information only to the proper unit/individual so that they may attempt to respond to the inquiry.</p>

This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually. We may also disclose your information to third parties when obligated to do so by law and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.</p>
                            <p>Like most businesses, we will use information we receive for our business purposes and keep this information for as long as we have a legitimate business purpose as permitted by applicable law. We may also disclose your information to third parties when obligated to do so by law and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.</p>
