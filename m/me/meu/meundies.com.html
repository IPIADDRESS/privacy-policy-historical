Privacy
</h1>
<h2>
1. Disclaimer &amp; Privacy Policy
</h2>
<p>
The information we collect through our Site helps us provide you with
information specific to your needs and interests. This privacy policy (the
"Privacy Policy") covers the MeUndies website (the “Site”). Please read below
to review our Privacy Policy and the types of information we gather through
our Site. By visiting the Site you are agreeing that you accept the practices
described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>
2. What Security Procedures Does MeUndies Use To Protect Personal Information?
</h2>
<p>
We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to assist us in
preventing unauthorized access, maintaining data accuracy, and correctly
using your Personal Information. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy,
we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your Personal
Information to the employees, agents, and officers of MeUndies who need the
information for their jobs.
</p>
<h2>
3. Will MeUndies Disclose Information To Outside Parties?
</h2>
<p>
MeUndies may share information with its subsidiaries and other affiliated
companies, and with other carefully selected vendors and business partners
with whom we work (collectively, "Site Affiliates"). This includes companies
that offer affinity, frequent-user, and reward programs; and, companies that
perform marketing services and other business operations for us (including
providing goods and services to our users, as necessary to complete
transactions you request). All companies that act on our behalf are
contractually obligated to keep all information confidential and to use the
customer information only to provide the services we ask them to perform for
you and us. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales,
traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third party
vendors, but these statistics do not include Personal Information. We may
disclose Personal Information we collect from you if required to do so by law
or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law
or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect
and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of other users of
our Site; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of
users of our Site or the public. On a limited basis, we may also disclose
your Personal Information to certain Site Affiliates for their use in
contacting you, when we reasonably believe their products or services are
complementary to your interests or MeUndies’ business.
</p>
<h2>
4. External Links
</h2>
<p>
We are not responsible for how other companies or organizations collect, use,
disclose, or secure the information that you provide them. If you choose to
access a third party Site linked to our Site, you do so at your own risk and
subject to any terms of service or privacy policy (if any) associated with
such third party Sites.
</p>
<h2>
5. Collection Of Information From Children
</h2>
<p>
MeUndies does not direct any content specifically to children. Users of our
Site are required to be at least 18 years old or have their parents consent.
</p>
<h2>
6. Consent To Processing In The United States
</h2>
<p>
By providing any Personal Information to MeUndies, all users, including,
without limitation, users in Canada and the member states of the European
Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and
to the transfer of such Personal Information across international borders in
accordance with MeUndies’ standard operations, including the collection,
storage, and processing of such information in the United States of America.
</p>
<h2>
7. Your California Privacy Rights
</h2>
<p>
As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83, a California resident
who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has
established a business relationship for personal, family, or household
purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about
whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties
for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business
has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request
by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all
third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding
calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information
that were disclosed. However, under the law, a business is not required to
provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the
public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's Personal
Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the
customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the
business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply
with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent
disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to
exercise that right. Except as expressly stated in this Privacy Policy, we do
not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes
unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting in
to receive information from a third party that is participating in some
activity describes on our site. If you do ask us to share your information
with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information
in connection with that specific activity, as we do not share information
with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your
Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt
in to such use when you provide Personal Information on our site. Please note
that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party,
your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you
later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information,
you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over
how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy
policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that
entity will handle your information.
</p>
<p>
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the
above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in
its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s Personal
Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the
customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the
business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply
with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent
disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to
exercise that right.
</p>
<p>
California customers may request further information about our compliance
with this law by emailing privacy@meundies.com. Please note that we are only
required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not
required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email
address.
</p>
<h2>
8. Modification And Notification Of Changes
</h2>
<p>
MeUndies may at our sole discretion edit this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>
9. In Summary
</h2>
<p>
MeUndies is committed to protecting your privacy. The information collected
from our Site enables us to understand our customer and our market, which in
turn allows us to deliver our highest level of service to our past, current
and future customers.

You may purchase Gift Cards for any value between $10 and $300 US dollars.

You may be able to obtain your gift card balance by contacting MeUndies customer service at

DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
<em>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.&nbsp; It requires you to arbitrate disputes with MeUndies and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</em>
</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<em>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</em>
You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, to any products sold or distributed through the Website, MeUndies’ consumer marketing or advertising practices, or to any aspect of your consumer relationship with MeUndies, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or MeUndies may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
<strong>This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</strong>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p>
<strong>
IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH MEUNDIES, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST MEUNDIES ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF.  INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.  IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
</strong>
</p><ol start="2" type="a">
<li>
<u>Arbitration Rules and Forum.</u>
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim and the relief sought to our registered agent at 3650 Holdrege Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90016.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.&nbsp;&nbsp; Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, MeUndies will pay them for you.  In addition, MeUndies will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, MeUndies will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</p><ol start="3" type="a">
<li>
<u>Authority of Arbitrator.</u>
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and MeUndies.   The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.&nbsp; The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.&nbsp; The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
</li>
<li>
<u>Waiver of Jury Trial.</u>
YOU AND MEUNDIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and MeUndies are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 15(a) above.&nbsp; An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.   However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
</li>
<li>
<u>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</u>
YOU AND MEUNDIES AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  In the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes shall be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 14.
</li>
<li>
<u>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</u>
You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: MeUndies, Attn: Legal Department, 3650 Holdrege Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90016, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, your MeUndies username (if any), the email address you used to set up your MeUndies account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.    If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
</li>
<li>
<u>Severability.</u>
Subject to Section 15(e), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
</li>
<li>
<u>Survival of Agreement.</u>
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with MeUndies.
</li>
<li>
<u>Modification.</u>
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if MeUndies makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to MeUndies.
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<li>
<strong>MISCELLANEOUS.</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<u>Severability/Waiver.</u>
Subject to Section 15(e), if any these provisions will be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision.

<h2>
1. Disclaimer &amp; Privacy Policy
</h2>
<p>
The information we collect through our Site helps us provide you with
information specific to your needs and interests. This privacy policy (the
"Privacy Policy") covers the MeUndies website (the “Site”). Please read below
to review our Privacy Policy and the types of information we gather through
our Site. By visiting the Site you are agreeing that you accept the practices
described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>
2. What Security Procedures Does MeUndies Use To Protect Personal Information?
</h2>
<p>
We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to assist us in
preventing unauthorized access, maintaining data accuracy, and correctly
using your Personal Information. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy,
we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your Personal
Information to the employees, agents, and officers of MeUndies who need the
information for their jobs.
</p>
<h2>
3. Will MeUndies Disclose Information To Outside Parties?
</h2>
<p>
MeUndies may share information with its subsidiaries and other affiliated
companies, and with other carefully selected vendors and business partners
with whom we work (collectively, "Site Affiliates"). This includes companies
that offer affinity, frequent-user, and reward programs; and, companies that
perform marketing services and other business operations for us (including
providing goods and services to our users, as necessary to complete
transactions you request). All companies that act on our behalf are
contractually obligated to keep all information confidential and to use the
customer information only to provide the services we ask them to perform for
you and us. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales,
traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third party
vendors, but these statistics do not include Personal Information. We may
disclose Personal Information we collect from you if required to do so by law
or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law
or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect
and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of other users of
our Site; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of
users of our Site or the public. On a limited basis, we may also disclose
your Personal Information to certain Site Affiliates for their use in
contacting you, when we reasonably believe their products or services are
complementary to your interests or MeUndies’ business.
</p>
<h2>
4. External Links
</h2>
<p>
We are not responsible for how other companies or organizations collect, use,
disclose, or secure the information that you provide them. If you choose to
access a third party Site linked to our Site, you do so at your own risk and
subject to any terms of service or privacy policy (if any) associated with
such third party Sites.
</p>
<h2>
5. Collection Of Information From Children
</h2>
<p>
MeUndies does not direct any content specifically to children. Users of our
Site are required to be at least 18 years old or have their parents consent.

6. Consent To Processing In The United States
</h2>
<p>
By providing any Personal Information to MeUndies, all users, including,
without limitation, users in Canada and the member states of the European
Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and
to the transfer of such Personal Information across international borders in
accordance with MeUndies’ standard operations, including the collection,
storage, and processing of such information in the United States of America.
</p>
<h2>
7. Your California Privacy Rights
</h2>
<p>
As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83, a California resident
who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has
established a business relationship for personal, family, or household
purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about
whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties
for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business
has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request
by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all
third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding
calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information
that were disclosed. However, under the law, a business is not required to
provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the
public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's Personal
Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the
customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the
business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply
with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent
disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to
exercise that right. Except as expressly stated in this Privacy Policy, we do
not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes
unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting in
to receive information from a third party that is participating in some
activity describes on our site. If you do ask us to share your information
with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information
in connection with that specific activity, as we do not share information
with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your
Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt
in to such use when you provide Personal Information on our site. Please note
that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party,
your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you
later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information,
you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over
how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy
policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that
entity will handle your information.
</p>
<p>
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the
above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in
its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s Personal
Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the
customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the
business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply
with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent
disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to
exercise that right.
</p>
<p>
California customers may request further information about our compliance
with this law by emailing privacy@meundies.com. Please note that we are only
required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not
required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email
address.
</p>
<h2>
8. Modification And Notification Of Changes

<p>
MeUndies may at our sole discretion edit this Privacy Policy.

<h2>
9. In Summary
