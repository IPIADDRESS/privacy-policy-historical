                                    <p align="left" class="style31">At the time you register to become a Member of MegaMeeting.com you are provided a check-off box on the registration page which gives you an opportunity to opt out of disclosures of your nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. If you are registered as a Member of MegaMeeting.com, you also may log onto MegaMeeting.com, then click on the link ‘YourAccount.MegaMeeting.com' to enter or edit your choices concerning future disclosure of your nonpublic personal information to third parties not affiliated with Internet MegaMeeting, LLC. You also may call the following toll-free telephone number to opt out of disclosures of your nonpublic personal information to unaffiliated third parties: </p>

                                    <p class="style31">Internet MegaMeeting.com reserves the right to send you certain communications without giving you a right to opt out from receipt of them. The communications for which no opportunity to opt out is provided include service announcements, administrative messages, notices and demands required or permitted by law, amendments to the Agreement and the Privacy Policy, and communications concerning the rights of you, us, or any other persons affected by MegaMeeting.com or the Services. </p>
                                    <p class="style31">You are not provided any opportunity to opt out of protocols which are part of the function of MegaMeeting.com and the Services and that are likely to disclose some personal information about you to third parties not affiliated with Internet MegaMeeting, LLC. For example, your browser must provide an IP address to exchange communications. As another example, it is an essential part of the functional protocol for Hosted meetings using the Services of MegaMeeting.com that the Member acting as Host is supplied with a valid user name and a valid, functional email address (and sometimes additional personal identification information) for each person who requests participation in a Host's session so that the Host can exercise a right of consent to each participant. Internet MegaMeeting, LLC does not obtain control over persons merely by accepting registration of them as Members of MegaMeeting.com or by their participation in use of the Services during Host's session. A Member acting as a Host therefore is an unaffiliated third party that receives and could collect such information concerning prospective participants in a manner which is beyond the practical control of Internet MegaMeeting, LLC. Similarly, a Host must provide prospective participants with means to identify a particular Host for a particular session in connection with requests for participation in that Host's particular session, and such prospective participants are third parties unaffiliated with Internet MegaMeeting, LLC who could record that information. </p>

                                    <p class="style31">If you have registered as a Member of MegaMeeting.com you may log on using your User ID and password, then click on the link YourAccount.MegaMeeting.com to edit your registration information, to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from portions or all categories of future marketing communications from Internet MegaMeeting, LLC and its affiliates. Some of your registration information cannot be completely deleted because that information may be required to send you necessary communications and notices even after your account is terminated. To enable us to limit risks of fraud and abuse of our services and systems, it may take up to 90 days to fully implement some editing changes which you request to your account and this is particularly true of requests to terminate and delete a Member's account. Even after 90 days it is possible that certain information may be retained in off-line backup systems, though we will endeavor to remove terminated accounts from our on-line data bases within 90 days. </p>
