Trying online warehouses was an uncertain experience at first but I have found Megabuy to be excellent. Delivery is very quick. Sometimes I have a tracking number and sometimes I don't. It would be good to have a more specific delivery time as I no longer have an office to send goods to, and can't sit at home waiting for it.</div>

<div class="feedback_text">Good prices, fast shipping times. Been using Megabuy for years. Even if they are slightly more expensive, and they are cheaper 99% of the time, I go with them. Some of the more esoteric stuff I want and they don't have is usually not anywhere in AU and I have to source from the US. No biggie, Megabuy's selection is huge. And has all the stuff I need fast. If stuff breaks within warranty their RMA process actually works (and there are plenty of others where it does not ...).</div>
