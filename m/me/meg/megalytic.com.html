                    <h2>How We Collect Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We collect Personal Information in the course of providing the Service to you, including through your voluntary, optional submissions, such as information that you provide to us at the time of registering for the Service, or through your use of   the Service. When you register with us for an account, we may collect information such as your name and email address.

You may also provide Personal Information to us in other ways, such as by requesting user support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may also receive Personal Information about you from third party data sources that you choose to connect to the Service (“Third Party Personal Information”), and may combine such information with other Personal Information we maintain about you. If we do so, this policy also  applies to such Third Party Personal Information.

                    <h2>How We Use Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We use Personal Information that we collect to (a) provide, improve, and develop the Service, (b) tailor your user experience,  (c) respond to your inquiries or requests, (d) prevent or investigate fraudulent or inappropriate usage of the Service, (f) conduct research and development, and  (e) analyze trends, and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

                    <h2>How We Share Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may share Personal Information with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of providing the Service and for  the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We limit the Personal Information shared with these third parties to that which is reasonably necessary to carry out those functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may also share Personal Information with third parties (including regulatory or law enforcement authorities) (a) in order to carry out a user’s request, or (b) if we believe that doing so is necessary (i) to conform or comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, (ii) to protect or defend our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others or (iii) to enforce the Terms of Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you post any of your information to a public area of the Service, please be aware that it is no longer “Personal Information” for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, and we or anyone else may use such information without restriction. If you provide access to personal or other information, including your email address or name, to a limited set of other users through any of our privacy controls or other settings, please understand that the Company has no control over how others may collect, use, or disclose such information.

                    <p>
                        We may also collect information that is not personally identifiable, and may aggregate Personal Information or otherwise render it anonymous ( collectively, “Non-Personal Information). We may use Non-Personal Information that we collect to (a) provide, improve, and develop the Service and otherwise tailor your user experience, (b) prevent or investigate fraudulent or inappropriate usage of our Service, and (c)  conduct research and development, and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We may  also share  Non-Personal Information with third parties.

                    <h2>Usage Tracking and Passive Collection of Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may collect information from your use of the Service. For example, we may collect information about user traffic and usage patterns throughout our site, and similar information regarding the use of the Service. We may also track click-through information, such as IP addresses, from the messages we send to our users. We use the information we collect in these manners to, for example, improve our Service, to develop new products and services, to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, to discourage and address abusive and fraudulent use of our Service, and to help our users with troubleshooting issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may also collect information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (“Web beacons”). When you visit the Site or use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser or recognizes a cookie that is already on your machine. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, and to customize your experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, many aspects of  the Service will not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Also, please be aware that third parties may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their services or content. We do not have access to, or control over, these third-party means of passive data collection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we directly combine any Non-personal Information gathered through passive means with Personal Information gathered through such means, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this policy. Otherwise, we use information collected by passive means in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable forms.
