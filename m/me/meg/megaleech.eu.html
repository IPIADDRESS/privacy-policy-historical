<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p align="justify">
	Like most website operators, premiumleech.info collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
	browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
	and the date and time of each visitor request. premiumleech.info purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
	information is to better understand how premiumleech.info visitors use its website. From time to time, premiumleech.info may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
	the usage of its website.
</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">
	premiumleech.info also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
	addresses. premiumleech.info does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not
	disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
	personally-identifying information, as described below.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p align="justify">
	Certain visitors to premiumleech.info websites choose to interact with premiumleech.info in ways that require premiumleech.info to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that premiumleech.info gathers
	depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our website and chooses to register, provide a username
	and email address. In each case, premiumleech.info collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
	appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with premiumleech.info. premiumleech.info does not
	disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to
	supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
	website-related activities.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p align="justify">
	premiumleech.info may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, premiumleech.info may reveal how many downloads a particular file got, or say which plugins are most popular based on checks from
	polls. However, premiumleech.info does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p align="justify">
	premiumleech.info discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of
	its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
	process it on premiumleech.info’s behalf or to provide services available at premiumleech.info websites, and (ii) that
	have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
	located outside of your home country; by using premiumleech.info websites, you consent to the transfer of such
	information to them. premiumleech.info will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
	personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated
	organizations, as described above, premiumleech.info discloses potentially personally-identifying and
	personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when premiumleech.info believes in good
	faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of premiumleech.info,
	third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a premiumleech.info website and have supplied
	your email address, premiumleech.info may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit
	your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with premiumleech.info and our products. We try to keep this type of email to a minimum.
	If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
	right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
	premiumleech.info takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration,
	or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p align="justify">

	premiumleech.info visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to
