          <p>&nbsp;</p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our  website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal  information. 
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
       
          <h5><strong>(1) What information do we collect?</strong></h5>
          <p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of  personal data:</p>
          <p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;information  about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (including  your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length  of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visit and number of page views);</p>
          <p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; information that you provide to us for the  purpose of registering with us (including your name, email address and password);</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h5><strong>(2) Cookies</strong></h5>
          <p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a  web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to  the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables  the web server to identify and track the web browser. </p>
                <p>We use “session” cookies on  the website. We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you  navigate the website; and when you recommend any other person to visit our  website (using the referral email system). </p>
          <p>Session cookies will be  deleted from your computer when you close your browser.&nbsp; </p>
Most browsers  allow you to refuse to accept cookies.&nbsp;  (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by  clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all  cookies” using the sliding selector.)&nbsp;  This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites.
