</p><p><a name="1"></a><b>1. Your privacy is a top priority. </b>

</p><p>We are committed to your privacy. We take great care to protect the security of your customer information and to control how it may be used. You may tell us at any time about your information sharing preferences. In addition, we will provide annual notification of our privacy policies and procedures to keep our customers informed about this issue.

</p><p align="right">[ <a href="#top">Back to top</a> ]</p>

<p><a name="2"></a><b>2. The accounts and services you use are provided in a secure environment. </b>

</p><p>We use sophisticated technology and security measures to protect your customer information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard nonpublic personal information. Whether you conduct business with us at our banking offices or financial centers, or by mail, telephone, electronic transfers, or the Internet, you can be confident that our security measures are appropriate to each of these servicing channels.

</p><p>We are careful to limit access to your nonpublic personal information. Our employees have limited access to customer information based on their responsibilities. This access enables them to assist you in completing transactions, offer you additional financial services, and resolve any customer service issues that may arise. All employees are instructed to follow the confidentiality guidelines provided in our Code of Conduct, which is strictly enforced. In addition, nonaffiliated third parties may be given access to customer information under certain circumstances. For example, a third party who provides a specialized service on our behalf (such as check printing) may access only the information necessary to perform that service. Or, in cases when you authorize us to provide your customer information to others, we limit access only to the specified information, and only for the purpose you have authorized.

</p><p align="right">[ <a href="#top">Back to top</a> ]</p>

<p><a name="3"></a><b>3. We collect information in order to service and administer your customer relationship. </b>

</p><p>In the course of serving or administering your customer relationship, we collect a variety of nonpublic personal information which is provided by you, as well as other sources, and may include:
</p><ul class="paragraph">
<li>Information we receive from you, such as your name, address, Social Security number, assets, and income, as provided, for example, on a loan application or account opening form.

</li><li>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, and others, such as balances, payment history, parties to transactions, and account usage.

</li><li>Information we receive from affiliates, credit reporting agencies and other third parties not affiliated with us, such as your creditworthiness, credit history, and real estate appraisals.

</li><li>Medical information submitted as part of an insurance application or claim, which is used only for the specific purposes authorized by you or by law.
</li></ul>
<p>The information we collect is based on the services we may provide to you. This information is used or shared as described in the section that follows.

</p><p align="right">[ <a href="#top">Back to top</a> ]</p>

<p><a name="4"></a><b>4. Your customer information is shared only in limited ways and is carefully controlled. </b>

</p><p>We use or share customer information in a limited and carefully controlled manner. For example, the information we collect is used for purposes such as:
</p><ul class="paragraph">
<li>To identify you in order to protect against fraud and guard against unauthorized access to your accounts.

</li><li>To enable us to complete your transactions quickly and efficiently, and to provide you with quality customer service.

</li><li>To better serve your relationship by understanding which services may be the right match for your needs, and telling you about new offers that may be of interest to you.

</li><li>To help ensure that our information about you is current and accurate.
</li></ul>
<p>Examples of categories of customer information that we may share include:
</p><ul class="paragraph">
<li>Information we receive from you, such as your name, address, Social Security number, assets, and income, as provided, for example, on a loan application or account opening form.

</li><li>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, and others, such as balances, payment history, parties to transactions, and account usage.

</li><li>Information we receive from affiliates, credit reporting agencies and other third parties not affiliated with us, such as your creditworthiness, credit history, and real estate appraisals.
</li></ul>
<p>This customer information may be shared with authorized users, including both affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties, in order to provide you with the services and financial choices that are most likely to be of value to you. These sharing policies and practices are described in this section.

</p><p><b>With affiliates: </b>

</p><p>We may share customer information with affiliates as follows:

</p><ul class="paragraph"><li>Our various administrative and service departments use customer information as part of their data processing requirements to prepare your account statements or service your accounts.

</li><li>Our affiliates provide a wide range of services to meet your financial needs. We may share customer information so that they can tell you about services and products that may be of special interest or value to you.
</li></ul>
<p>Our affiliates include financial service providers such as banks, securities broker-dealers, investment advisors, insurance agencies, and transfer agents.

</p><p><b>With third parties not affiliated with us: </b>

</p><p>We may share the customer information we collect, as described earlier in this section, on a limited basis with certain nonaffiliated third parties. For example, we share information in order to process your transactions. We may also share this information with those who perform marketing services on our behalf, or financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements that provide for the confidentiality and security of customer information. In addition, customer information may be shared with parties who provide products or services that we believe will be of value or interest to you. And we may share customer information with other nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law.

</p><p>The third parties with whom customer information may be shared include:
</p><ul class="paragraph">
<li>Companies that provide services necessary to effect a transaction that you request or to service your account — for example, a check printing company.

</li><li>Companies or others that provide specialized services on our behalf, such as programming contractors, credit bureaus, or companies that help us market our services.

</li><li>Financial service providers, such as insurance, mortgage, or credit card companies.

</li><li>Non-financial companies, such as suppliers of software designed to increase the security of your home computer, or provide you with tax preparation or financial planning tools.

</li><li>Government agencies, courts, parties to lawsuits, or regulators to whom we may provide information about you and your transactions. For example, federal and state laws give people involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings the right to obtain records and customer information from us. In such cases, we share only the information that we are required or authorized to share.
</li></ul>

<p align="right">[ <a href="#top">Back to top</a> ]</p>

<p><a name="5"></a><b>5. You always have options about how your customer information may be shared, and your privacy preferences will be respected. </b>

</p><p>You have options about how your customer information may be shared. You can notify us of your preferences by completing and returning the form included in this publication. Here is a brief description of these options:
</p><ul class="paragraph">
<li><b>Information sharing with affiliates:</b> You may tell us not to share information with our affiliates.  If you do, we will respond in two ways.  First, we will not share information about our experiences with you, such as your account history and transactions with us, to enable affiliates to market their services to you; therefore, you may not receive information from our affiliates about special offers or services for which you may be eligible.  We may still share experience information with our affiliates in other ways, for example, as needed to service your relationship.  Second, we will not share non-experience information about you, such as information we receive from credit reporting agencies, to enable affiliates to market their services to you, or for any other purpose except as required or permitted by law.

<p></p></li><li><b>Information sharing with nonaffiliated third parties:</b> You may tell us not to share information with nonaffiliated third parties.  If you do, we will only share nonpublic personal information about you with nonaffiliated third parties as needed to service your relationship or fight fraud or as otherwise required or permitted by law.  We will not share information about you with nonaffiliated third parties to enable them to market their products to you.  As a result, you may not receive information about additional services that would otherwise be made available to you and may be of interest to you.
</li></ul>
<p>Please note that for joint accounts, any one of the joint account holders has the right to exercise the options described above. If you exercise one or both of the options above, your decision will also apply to others with whom you jointly hold accounts.

</p><p>From time to time, you may receive privacy-related communications from other companies or entities not listed in this publication or not affiliated with us, including those that may have a joint marketing agreement with us. We encourage you to review all of these communications carefully. If you wish to communicate your privacy preferences, please notify each of these companies or entities separately, in accordance with the instructions you receive from each company.

</p><p align="right">[ <a href="#top">Back to top</a> ]</p>

<p><a name="6"></a><b>6. We will work together with you to protect the security of your customer information, and to keep your information accurate and current. </b>
