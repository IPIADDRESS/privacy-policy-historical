Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;">Sharing Information with Third Parties</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We do not share, sell or trade with third parties your Personal Information gathered online or via mobile, such as email addresses or mobile phone numbers, Personal Information collected as part of an online survey or other specific details about you, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy. We do not contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to such Personal Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Personal Information and Aggregate Information we collect may be shared with reputable third-party organizations to contact consumers for marketing and promotional purposes. Third party contacts to our customers may be initiated only by postal mail. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your telephone number(s) or e-mail address.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We may divulge Personal Information if such action is required for Melissa &amp; Doug, LLC or any of our service providers or consultants to comply with any valid legal process, such as a subpoena, search warrant, statute or court order, or any valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency. In addition, we may divulge Personal Information if we or any of our service providers or consultants believes that such disclosure is necessary to address any unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another customer or of the general public.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;">Service Providers</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We may share Personal Information and Aggregate Information with our service providers, consultants and affiliates for our internal business purposes. For example, we use the services of Google, Inc (www.google.com) to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Site. The type of information we collect includes products viewed and/or purchased, your location (state/zip code if you placed an order) and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers, which deliver the Web pages to you, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our Site, our servers log your IP address. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We also share with Shopatron, an e-Commerce platform provider (www.Shopatron.com), Bronto, an email service provider (www.Bronto.com), and with Mogreet, a mobile marketing service provider (www.Mogreet.com) usage information about visitors to our Online and Mobile Sites who have received a targeted promotional campaign with Bronto, Shopatron or Mogreet for the purpose of order processing, targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;">Use of Cookies</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A cookie is a small data file that Web sites, when you visit them, often store on your hard drive. A cookie may contain information (such as unique user ID), which is used to track the pages of the sites you've visited.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">MelissaAndDoug.com and our mobile sites use cookies to preserve the contents of your shopping cart between your visits. MelissaAndDoug.com and our mobile sites also use cookies to measure activity on our Sites, which allows us to determine which areas and features of our Sites are most popular. This information allows us to make improvements and updates to enhance your MelissaAndDoug.com and mobile experiences. Parts of the Sites, such as the members-only areas (for example, shopping) will not function if you do not have cookies enabled. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you turn off cookies or refuse them, though, you will not be able to make a purchase from the Site, nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">To enable or disable cookies on your browser, please consult your browser documentation or contact your software provider.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;">Security and SSL</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Site address will change from "http" to "https." Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our shopping page and place your order by phone at (800) 284-3958.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;">Information Removal/Opt-Out</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">If you prefer not to receive marketing emails, SMS, MMS or Text Messages from MelissaAndDoug.com, our mobile sites or affiliate sites, please let us know by clicking on the unsubscribe link within any marketing email, SMS, MMS or Text Message you receive from us.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;">Children and Privacy</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet, and understand that children may not understand all the provisions of our Privacy Policy or make informed decisions about the choices that are made available to adult users of the Site. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a customer is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;">Links to Other Sites</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">MelissaAndDoug.com, our mobile and affiliate sites may contain links to sites other than our own. Those sites may have their own privacy policy or no privacy policy at all. Neither we nor any of our service providers have any responsibility for those sites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience of our visitors. Such links may be to advertisers, content providers or other companies who may use our logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you and may collect information and use it in a way inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of any third-party sites or services before providing any of them with any of your Personal Information. Neither Melissa &amp; Doug, LLC nor any of our service providers control the content that appears on these sites or take any responsibility for their content, nor should it be implied that Melissa &amp; Doug. LLC, MelissaAndDoug.com or our mobile sites endorse or otherwise recommend such sites or their products or services offered.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;">Additional Information</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">No transmission of data over the Internet or via Mobile is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Melissa &amp; Doug, LLC, MelissaAndDoug.com and our mobile sites to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect Your Personal Information, neither Melissa &amp; Doug, LLC, MelissaAndDoug.com and our mobile sites nor any of our service providers can ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;">Limitation on Liability</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">IN NO EVENT SHALL MELISSA &amp; DOUG, LLC, MELISSAANDDOUG.COM AND OUR MOBILE SITES OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATED ENTITIES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF THESE ENTITIES HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION, UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE, INABILITY TO USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE FROM THE SITE. These limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose or the existence of any limited remedy. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;">Applicable Law</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The laws of the State of Connecticut will govern these disclaimers, terms and conditions without giving effect to any principles of conflict of law.</p>
