	<h2 class="section">How Information Is Collected</h2>

	<h3>Registration and Account Set Up</h3>
	<p>When you sign up for services from Mevio, you will be asked to provide
	certain basic contact Information. After this is entered you, we will
	establish your account. You will be given the opportunity to provide
	additional Contact Information once your account is established. In addition,
	Financial Information may be collected to process payment for some of the
	premium services we provide or may provide in the future. </p>

	<h3>Customer Service</h3>
	<p>If you contact Mevio either via e-mail, telephone or letter, we may
	keep a record of the correspondence.</p>

	<h3>Invitations To Others</h3>
	<p>Mevio members can invite friends to check out Mevio and one or more
	of its sites by sending invitation emails through our automated invitation
	system. Mevio stores the email addresses that members provide so that you
	can get credit for inviting a new member and so the respondent can receive
	reminders of the invitation. Mevio does not sell these email addresses or
	use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation
	reminders. Recipients of invitations from Mevio may contact us to request
	the removal of their information from our database. </p>

	<h3>Cookies </h3>
	<p>Mevio may use cookies to store visitors preferences and to record session
	information to better the visitors experience and potentially better the
	advertising and marketing promotions relevance.</p>

	<h3>Links</h3>
	<p>Mevio is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on
	other sites. When linking to another site a user should read the privacy
	policy stated on that site. Our privacy policy only governs information
	collected on the Mevio family of websites. </p>

	<h3>Blogs and Chats</h3>
	<p>Whenever you voluntarily post information to blogs, message boards, chat
	rooms or other public forums, that information can be accessed by the public
	and used by any member of the public. Such use is beyond the control of Mevio.</p>

	<h3>Third Party Advertising </h3>
	<p>Ads appearing on this Web site may be delivered to Mevio by one of our
	Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies.
	These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they
	send you an online advertisement. This privacy statement does not cover the
	use of cookies by any advertisers. </p>

	<h3>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information </h3>
	<p>You may modify or remove any of your personal information at any time by
	logging into your account and accessing features that will allow you to edit
	your Profile and Account Information. </p>

	<h2>Security </h2>
	<p>Mevio member accounts are secured by member-created passwords and
	precautions are taken to insure that member account information is kept
	private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is
	stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to
	those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our
	customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot
	guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or
	use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the
	security of member information at any time. </p>

	<h2>Sharing and Disclosure of Collected Information </h2>
	<p>Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Mevio will not
	disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that
	disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond
	to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process; (2) to enforce the
	Mevio Terms of Use Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect
	the safety of members of the public and users of the service. Mevio reserves
	the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that
	acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of Mevio or
	substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. </p>

	<h2>Changes in Our Privacy Policy </h2>
	<p>From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy If we make
	changes, we will post them on our site to make users aware of what the changes
	are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use
	it, and when we may disclose it. A User is bound by any minor changes to the
	policy when she or he uses the site after those changes have been posted If,
	however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a
	manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we
	will notify by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days. </p>
