    privacy statement applies to the Meijer.com web site ("Site"), excluding that
    portion of the Site designated as MyPhotoAlbum.Meijer.com which is subject to its own
    privacy statement.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Meijer.com makes every effort to create an
    online environment that is safe, easy, and respects your privacy. We hold all information
    you provide in confidence. We will not sell, rent or give your information to anyone
    without your consent, nor use it for any purpose for which you've not given your consent.<br>
    <br>
    Just like you, we're especially aware of children's privacy issues. We know that parents
    are justifiably concerned about their children's activities online and what's being done
    with the information they reveal. That's why we will never intentionally collect
    information from children under 13, with the exception of email addresses used only for
    reply purposes. <br>
    <br>
    The rest of this document outlines in more detail the kind of information Meijer.com
    collects and what we do with it.<br>
    <br>
    1. When you visit Meijer.com, our web server automatically recognizes your domain name,
    your computer's operating system, browser type, the address of the web page you're coming
    from and of those you visit on our website. (None of this information is personally
    identifiable and is used only to improve the performance of Meijer.com). Our web server
    does <strong>NOT</strong> recognize or collect your email address. <br>
    <br>
    2. Meijer.com uses contractors (other companies) to perform some services, such as
    processing, fulfilling and delivering orders, sending postal mail and email, and updating
    guest information. These contractors have access only to the personal information needed
    to perform these services, and they will never use such information for any other purpose.
    <br>
    <br>
    3. When you register, enter a contest, opt into an email program, or make a purchase using
    a credit card, Meijer.com and our contractors may collect and store some or all of the
    following information: user ID, password, name, shipping and billing addresses, shipping
    and billing phone numbers, card type, card number, card expiration date, and optional
    personal information. This information is used by Meijer.com and/or our contractors to
    bill you for your purchase, ship your order, send email notices, or verify and ship a
    contest prize. It is never used for any other purpose without your consent.<br>
    <br>
    4. A "Cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web
    browser to be read back from that browser. Cookies are a way to have the browser
    "remember" specific bits of information. We use "Cookies" to store
    your preferences and record session information (such as items that you add to your
    shopping cart).<br>
    <br>
    5. We archive correspondence of those who communicate with us via email. This information
    is used only to follow up regarding an email inquiry, contest entry, or an order you've
    placed online. Your email address will not be used by us or our contractors for any other
    purpose unless you choose to opt in to an email program, such as ValuPagE-mail.<br>
    <br>
    6. If you supply us with your postal address online or via email, we will only use that
    address to contact you regarding information you requested, a contest entry, or an order
    you've placed online. Your postal address will not be used by us or our contractors for
    any other purpose.<br>
    <br>
    7. If you supply us with your telephone number online or via email, we will only use that
    number to contact you regarding information you requested, a contest entry, or an order
    you've placed online. Your telephone number will not be used by us or our contractors for
    any other purpose.<br>
    <br>
    8. We do not partner with or have any relationships with any ad server companies. This
    means that these companies cannot place Cookies on your computer or track or monitor your
    activity while visiting Meijer.com.<br>
    <br>
    Exception: ValuPage, a contractor of Meijer.com, is hosted by SuperMarkets Online
    (http://www.supermarkets.com). When visiting the ValuPage site, Cookies may be placed on
    your computer by one or more of the companies who have advertising banners displayed on
    that site.<br>
    <br>
    9. From time to time, we may use guest information for new, unanticipated uses. If our
    information practices change at some time in the future, these changes will be posted on
    the page you're reading now. At no time will your privacy ever be compromised, and you'll
    always be asked if you want to opt in to any of these new uses.<br>
    <br>
    10. We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and
    receiving financial data exchanged with our site.<br>
    <br>
