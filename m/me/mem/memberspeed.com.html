ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION</span><span><br>
<br>
When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile for you from your product registration information. If you ever want to review or update that information, you can click on Update Profile, and edit any of the Personal Information in your profile. If you haven't already created a membership, we will ask you to do so. This ensures that only you can access your information.<br>

As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification username, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.<br>

When you register, you create your profile, your username and password. It is your passport to seamless travel across your member area, allowing you to download software and order more plug-in modules without having to fill out registration forms with information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register â just use your Registration ID to identify yourself. <br>
<br>

When you order from us, our 3rd party payment processors such as paypal and 2checkout will ask for your credit card number and billing address. They use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. <br>
<br>
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including programming,&nbsp; answering customer questions about products or services, sending email and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.<br>
