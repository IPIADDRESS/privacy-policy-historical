<br>
We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is important to you and to us. So we'll protect the information you share with us.

<br>
<b>NOTICE</b><br>
<br>

<br>

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time from your member profile. There, you can:<br>
<br>
View and edit personal information you have already given us. <br>
<br>
Tell us whether you want us to send you member updates or special offers.<br>
<br>
<b>SECURITY</b><br>
<br>

<br>
These security measures are in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse, to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration. <br>

<br>
When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile).

<br>
As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification username, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.<br>
<br>
When you register, you create your profile, your username and password. It is your passport to seamless travel across your member area, allowing you to download software and order more plug-in modules without having to fill out registration forms with information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register – just use your Registration ID to identify yourself. <br>

When you order from us, our 3rd party payment processors such as paypal and 2checkout will ask for your credit card number and billing address. They use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. <br>
<br>
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including programming,&nbsp; answering customer questions about products or services, sending email and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.<br>
