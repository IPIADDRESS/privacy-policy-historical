</p>

<p><b></b></p><h4><b>Privacy options we provide when people signup</b></h4><p></p>
<p>
</p><ul><li><b>Public:</b> you share your personal online history of the social networks&amp;media with the world</li>
<li>
<b>Friends&amp;Family: </b> We use the same privacy settings of the social networks&amp;media you are registered with. (Question mark, text: what does this mean: this means e.g. that the same privacy settings from your social networks are applied for memory lane.  If you've hidden or selectively shared an album in facebook or flickr with certain people, only the people you want can view it in memorylane). 
</li>
<li>
<b>Private:</b> Nothing is publicly available. You save your digital history as your own personal diary on steroids.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
For all settings you can customize if you want to share e.g. your past twitter, flickr, last.fm etc. with the world, friends or if you want to collect your online history just for your own nostalgia/memories.</p>
