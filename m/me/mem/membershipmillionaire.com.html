They use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. <br>
<br>
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including programming,&nbsp; answering customer questions about products or services, sending email and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.<br>
