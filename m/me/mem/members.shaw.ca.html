	                        <div class="answer"><p>3.1.1 Customer's Personal Information:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>General:</strong><br>If you wish to obtain any of Shaw's products and/or services, Shaw will collect information about you when you subscribe for any of these products and/or services. The type of information we collect varies based on the service you have requested. The Personal Information most often collected and maintained in a Customer file may include (but is not limited to) name, address for service, mailing address, phone number(s), a piece of acceptable identification, alternate contact information, banking information for payment, non-Shaw email address (i.e. if you are an eBill user or if you are a Shaw Direct customer subscribing to one of our newsletters), credit card information for payment, credit rating/score. In order to conduct credit checks, we will collect one or more of the following: driver's license number, Social Insurance number, credit card number and/or date of birth.

Tuning Data is used for billing purposes, diagnostic purposes, for the tuning of recommendation engines and to measure television viewership. Shaw creates a database of anonymized and/or aggregated viewing behaviour by pairing Tuning Data with non-sensitive information in Customer files. This helps Shaw understand Customer reactions to television content and advertising. The collection of Tuning Data is critical to operating our video services and cannot be disabled. However, you can choose to opt-out of Shaw's use of Tuning Data in an anonymized and aggregated database by using the process described in Subsection 3.3 below. You can also disable the delivery of recommendations via your set-top-box settings.<br><br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Collection and Use of Personal information in connection with Shaw Go WiFi:</strong>&nbsp;<br>In order to access Shaw Go WiFi, you will be requested to provide your Shaw userid, password and certain other information that may be requested from time to time. Shaw will also automatically collect certain information such as device location, device type, and general usage information associated to the Media Access Control (“MAC”) address associated with your device (the “Device Information”). The Device Information is used to deliver the Shaw Go Wifi service, monitor and improve network traffic, improve your Shaw Go WiFi experience and for research and statistical purposes. Shaw may from time to time use the Device Information to deliver advertising to the browser you are using to access the Internet as outlined is our Terms of Use for Shaw Go WiFi. In certain instances, Shaw will rely on a third party to deliver Shaw Go WiFi services at a specified location (for example, certain airports, universities or other public buildings). The relationship with the third party is governed by strict privacy provisions, in compliance with PIPEDA. As part of the delivery of the Shaw Go WiFi services, the third party may have access to the Device Information, which can only be used for limited network monitoring and improvement purposes.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>

However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features available on Shaw's websites.<br><br>Third Party Cookies and Advertisements: Some of the advertisements you see on the Shaw websites are delivered by third party advertisers, Internet advertising companies that work on Shaw's behalf or ad networks. These third parties may use cookies or other technology to help deliver ads that are tailored to your interests and track their performance.
