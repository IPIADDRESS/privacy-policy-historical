<h3>Our commitment to your privacy</h3>
<p>
Membean, Inc., an Oregon corporation ("Membean"), respects your individual privacy. Our
privacy policy documents our adherence to industry standards for the protection of your personal
information.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Scope of the Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
This Privacy Policy covers Membean' treatment of personally identifiable information that may be
collected while you are on the Membean site, when you order and/or use its products or services or
that is shared with Membean by its business partners. This policy does not apply to the practices
of companies not owned or controlled by Membean or to people whom Membean does not employ
or manage, nor does it address non-personally identifiable information. The policy specifically
addresses the following areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What personally identifiable information is collected by Membean or by any third party through our site and/or via our products or services;</li>
<li>How Membean uses this information;</li>
<li>With whom Membean may share this information;</li>
<li>What choices are available to you as a user of the site and/or products and services with respect to collection, use and distribution of the information;</li>
<li>What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control; and</li>
<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
<p>
Membean is the sole owner of the information collected on this site or via our products and services.
Membean may collect information from you at two different stages. First, we collect anonymous,
aggregate information from all visitors to the site and users of our products and services. This
information is never linked to any personally identifiable information and is only used in the
aggregate to generate statistical reports about the use of our site, products and services. Second,
Membean collects personally identifiable information when you, or your school, school district,
parent or legal guardian (each, an “Account Creator”), create a Membean account and when
you or the Account Creator order Membean products or utilize certain services. Online account
creation may require you or the Account Creator to submit the following personal information:
name, address, school or school district information, email address, and the following information
for students that will access and use Membean products and services: student names, school
identification numbers and email address (the “Student Information”). For purposes of billing, you
may need to provide your credit card type, number, expiration date and billing address for the card.
Certain personally identifiable information is required if you subscribe to a Membean newsletter, or
sign up to participate in a promotion, sweepstake or survey through the site. Membean may also
receive personally identifiable information from our business partners.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Personal Information of Children Under 13</h3>
<p>
Membean complies with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
and the FTC’s Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512). If you are under 13 you must have your
parent’s or legal guardian’s approval prior to posing any content on the site. This is either obtained
through your school or school district administrator or directly from your parents or legal guardian.
Membean collects limited personal information from students, including the Student Information
described above ("Children's Personal Information"), but only where that student's school, school
district, parent and/or legal guardian has contracted with Membean to collect Children's Personal
Information from students for the use and benefit of the learning environment. Membean requires
schools and school districts to obtain consent from students' parents and/or legal guardians before
collecting any such Children's Personal Information. If you are a student, please do not send any
Children's Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when
you sign up for Membean products and services. In the event that we learn that we have collected
Children's Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained, or if we
learn a student has provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what we request when
he or she signs up for Membean products and services, we will delete that information as quickly
as possible. If you believe that a student may have provided us Children's Personal Information
beyond what is requested when signing up for Membean products and services, or that parental
consent has not obtained, please contact us at

<h3>Use of Your Personal Information</h3>
Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and
customized experience while using our site and to allow us to provide products and services to you.
Membean will never give your information to, or share your information with, any third party not
affiliated with or owned by Membean, except as permitted by law. Membean will send personally
identifiable information about you to other companies or people when:
<ul>
<li>We have your consent, including, if you are under 13, the consent of your parent or legal guardian, to share the information;</li>
<li>We need to share your information to provide the products or services you have requested;</li>
<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Membean to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us); or</li>
<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process or find that your actions violate the Membean Terms of Service or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Profile</h5>
<p>
We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our
customers. A profile is stored information detailing how individual customers use the site. Collected
information in a profile is tied to the customer’s personally identifiable information. However, your
profile is used solely for internal purposes, to help us improve the experience of our customers. We
do not share your profile with any third parties.
</p>
<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>
A cookie is a small text file stored on the customer’s hard drive for an extended period of time.
The cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Allowing a Membean
cookie to remain on your computer makes it easier for you to log in to and use the site.
</p>
<h5>Log files</h5>
<p>
Log files record internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service provider (ISP)
referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends,
administer the site, track a customer’s movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic
information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc are not linked to personally identifiable
information.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Disclosure of Personal Information As Required By Law</h3>
<p>
We will disclose personal information when required by law, or if we have good-faith belief that such
action is necessary to (a) comply with current judicial proceedings, a court order or legal process
served on us, (b) protect and defend our rights, or (c) protect the rights, property, and other
interests of our users or others.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Access to Children’s Personal Information</h3>
<p>
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if you are a student accessing and using Membean
products and services, you understand that your (i) parent and/or legal guardian, (ii) teachers and
(iii) school and school district administrators can view all information within or associated with your
Membean account, including without limitation messages between you and your teacher and grades
you received on assignments.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Business Transitions</h3>
<p>
In the event that Membean goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by
another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, our customers’ personal information may be
part of the assets transferred. Customers will be notified via prominent notice on our site prior
to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If, as a result of the business
transaction, your personally identifiable information will be used in a manner materially different
from that stated at the time of collection, you will be given a choice consistent with our Notification
of Changes section.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>
This site may contain links to and portions of other sites. Membean is not responsible for the privacy
practices or content of these other sites. When you leave our site or view a portion of a third party’s
site through our site, we encourage you to read the privacy statements of each such site. This
privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Membean.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
Wherever your personal information may be held within Membean or on its behalf, we intend to
take commercially reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you
share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, given the nature of the Internet
and the fact that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of
your information. We use encryption to protect sensitive information online. The servers that store
your personally identifiable information are housed in a secure environment. Finally, we also make
an effort to protect your information off-line.
When registering for access to a secure area of the site, we may ask you to select a username and
password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you
for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign out
of the registered site and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to
ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence when accessing
your computer.
</p>
</section>

<h3>Correcting, Updating, Deleting and Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
<p>
If your personally identifiable information changes, you may contact us to correct, update or
delete and deactivate our record of your personally identifiable information. Parents and/or legal
guardians may access your child’s information to correct, update, request deletion or further
collection and use of their information, including Children’s Personal Information, by contacting us
at the email address provided below or by contacting their school or school district administrator.
</p>
</section>
<section>
