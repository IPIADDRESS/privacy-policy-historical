            <strong>ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION </strong><br>
            <br>
            When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile for you from your product registration information.

            <strong>CUSTOMER PROFILES</strong><br>

            <br>
            When you register, you create your profile, your username and password. It is your passport to seamless travel across your member area, allowing you to download software and order more plugin modules without having to fill out registration forms with information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register – just use your Registration ID to identify yourself. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE<br>
            </strong><br>

We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, our 3rd party payment processors such as paypal and 2checkout will ask for your credit card number and billing address. They use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. <br>
            <br>
            We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including programming, answering customer questions about products or services, sending email and processing event registration.

            <br>
            If your information is lost or stolen, you must promptly notify us if your credit card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit card number, user name, or password from your account and update our records accordingly.<br>
