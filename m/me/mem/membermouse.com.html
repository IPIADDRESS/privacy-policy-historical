				<p>At Pop Fizz Studios, LLC (“Pop Fizz”), we respect the privacy of our readers. We are gravely concerned about practices which violate the basic rights of choice and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Here is our covenant with the readers who trust us with their personal information.</p>
<p>We Promise:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Any e-mail you give us is safe.</strong> We store your data in databases that only the staff of Pop Fizz have access to. No one besides us will ever get access to your e-mail address.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Third Party Use.</strong> We’ll never sell you. We never rent out or sell our subscriber lists to third parties like other companies might. So you’ll never receive junk mail or anything from any third-party by entering your details into any of our forms.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Easy “one-click” unsubscribe.</strong> If you want to get off our list permanently, there’s an “unsubscribe” link in every one of our outgoing e-mails. Just click it and you’re instantly off the list… that means you’ll never receive another e-mail from us (unless you specifically ask to, of course).</p>
<p>The remainder of this Privacy Policy will let you know what kind of information we collect on the website at easieronlinedating.com (the “Site”), how it is handled, with whom it may be shared, what choices you have regarding our use of your information and how you may access some of the data you provide to us.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Pop Fizz collects and stores personal information in several ways at different parts of our Site. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, age, gender, address, telephone number, User ID, User password, and other self-identifying information. This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for users to submit information to Pop Fizz, and receive back either the information, service, or products desired. Pop Fizz may also request certain information using online order forms for products and services. On the order forms, we may collect contact information, demographic information, method of payment and, if applicable, a credit or debit card number. We may also collect information about you in surveys or for sweepstakes and contests on our Site and information about the searches you perform and the pages you visit on our Site.</p>
<p>Pop Fizz may also monitor, on an anonymous aggregate basis, patterns of use in connection with e-mails that it sends out, including which links are clicked on in our email communications, so that we may use such information to better personalize the content of our Site and our mailings for our users. All such information will be protected in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We may also automatically collect your Internet Protocol address to help diagnose problems and for system administration.

                    <p><a href="http://www.limelightcrm.com">Lime Light CRM</a> is the leading provider of Continuity Transaction Processing and Campaign Management. The MemberMouse and Lime Light CRM teams have worked together from the beginning to ensure that a seamless and intelligent integration between the two platforms is achieved.</p>						    					
                    <p>Over 20 API calls have been developed to achieve this vision and the results are...</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use Lime Light CRM exactly as you have been.</li>
                        <li>All your products and campaigns are exposed to you within MemberMouse so you can use them to grant access to members in just a few clicks.</li>
                        <li>Easily insert 1-click buy links, upgrade/downgrade links and cancellation links that, when clicked, inform Lime Light CRM to execute a purchase using the card on file, switch recurring billing from one product to another and issue a refund.</li>
                        <li>Your members have the power to self-manage their subscriptions and customer information from a My Account page on your member site; the Lime Light CRM database is automatically updated.</li>
                        <li>Common business practices are automated, such as creating member accounts and granting access when a product is purchased via Lime Light CRM, notifying members if their payments are overdue, locking their account if it remains unpaid over a specified period of time and a lot more.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You just interact with MemberMouse's intuitive interface and focus on building and managing your member site. We take care of talking to Lime Light CRM behind-the-scenes to ensure that Lime Light CRM is kept up-to-date and that any events that occur in Lime Light CRM are reflected on your member site.</p>

                    <h2>Built On Top of WordPress</h2>

                    <p>A large part of building and managing member sites revolves around site design and content creation. WordPress is an established, world-class content management system that's infinitely extensible through the use of plugins and when it comes to determining how your site looks, is extremely flexible and there are thousands of themes available for immediate download for any need.</p>
                    <p>Rather than reinvent the wheel, we take full advantage of everything that WordPress brings to the table and deliver MemberMouse as a custom WordPress install.</p>
                    <p>The first thing you'll notice when using MemberMouse is that it feels like WordPress; it's a familiar and comfortable environment. Everything from publishing and managing content, to applying themes, to using plugins and even to
installing your MemberMouse site, will be exactly the same as in the standard WordPress install.</p>
                    <p>You'll also notice that in intuitive places, WordPress is augmented and extended to provide you with the tools necessary to build and manage member sites. Here are some examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Access over 15 screens for configuring and managing every aspect of your member site directly from the WordPress admin area.</li>
                        <li>Indicate which pages and posts certain members have access to right from the Edit Page/Post screens.</li>
                        <li>Add pixel codes to a page or post right from the Edit Page/Post screens.</li>
                        <li>Manage member-contributed blog posts right from the Manage Posts screen.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>It's one thing to talk about these features, but to really understand the extent of the power, you'll have to check out our online demo to see MemberMouse in action.</p>

                    <h2>Leverage the Power of Amazon S3</h2>
					<p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> is a scalable, reliable, secure and inexpensive data storage solution.</li>
                        <li>MemberMouse provides you with a tool called the File Vault where you sync all of your Amazon S3 content with MemberMouse (videos, audio, PDFs, graphics, etc.)</li>
                        <li>MemberMouse has a built-in feature for piracy-proofing your digital content.</li>
                        <li>Incorporating secure content into your site has never been easier thanks to our secure SmartTags™.</li>
                        <li>All content in the File Vault is protected by our Secure-3™ Content Delivery system. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When a secure piece of content is requested, MemberMouse passes that request on to Amazon S3. After authentication, Amazon S3 returns a self-expiring link that's only valid for a specific period of time. The member can then access the content using this link.</p>
                    <p>To insert a video or audio, just use our secure media SmartTag™ and MemberMouse will take care of retrieving a secure link and automatically displays the video or audio file in a <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/">JW player</a>.</p>
                    <p>How about protecting eBooks or other PDF content? We have a proprietary PDF protection technology built right into MemberMouse called eBook Lockdown Pro™, that drastically reduces the risk of your profits being siphoned away by piracy.</p>
                    <p>Just use our secure PDF SmartTag and MemberMouse will limit the number of downloads per user, track their IP address and here's the icing on the cake...</p>
                    <p>MemberMouse will watermark each page of the PDF with the member's personal information - their name, their email, their customer ID - and if this PDF ends up anywhere besides their desktop, you'll know who the culprit is and they'll know that you know.</p>
