        Hosting Privacy Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
        For current customers of the MemberSuite™ software service, we are committed to
        protecting your privacy. One of the ways in which we demonstrate this commitment
        is through the care we take to protect the privacy of information which we collect
        when we host your data on our servers. MemberSuite’ hosting services are provided
        by a recognized leader in providing secure managed hosting that delivers enterprise-class
        web infrastructure to businesses of all sizes – including Fortune 100 companies.
        Our provider operates the MemberSuite servers within their secure, state-of-the-art
        data center. MemberSuite selected our hosting provider based on their ability to
        provide fast and redundant access to the Internet, world class facilities, and commitment
        to high availability for MemberSuite’ applications. MemberSuite has entered into
        service agreements with our provider, with the objective, among others, of protecting
        the privacy of the people who use our software.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Collected Information:</h3>
    <p>
        Users' names and email addresses ("Customer Information") are collected and maintained
        in the MemberSuite™ application for purposes of managing the login authentication
        process, and to allow the application to send notifications to the end user. An
        example of an application notification would be an email notice informing the user
        that a scheduled task has been completed.
    </p>
    <p>
        MemberSuite will not give any Customer Information to a third party, unless we are
        required to do so in order to comply with the law, or to provide secure credit card
        processing.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Cookies:</h3>
    <p>
        The MemberSuite application utilizes session specific cookies so that only authenticated
        users can navigate the application. We also support non-session cookies for allowing
        the user to automatically remember their login credentials to gain access to the
        application.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Security:
    </h3>
    <p>
        All hosted environments meet the following physical security requirements…main access
        monitored with additional access for emergency purposes only; surveillance cameras
        in facility; access validation with biometric identity check; access only to persons
        on MemberSuite' approved access list which is managed at the executive level within
        MemberSuite.
    </p>
    <p>
        All hosted environments also meet the following electronic security conditions -
        login validation; creation of accounts only as verified by MemberSuite; secure SSL
        (encrypted) connections to access servers; servers running behind secure firewall.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the options we offer is Secure Socket Layer (SSL). If you implement our SSL
        option, we will not transmit Customer Information for the particular user interface
        that has the SSL over the public internet "in the clear", i.e., without it first
        being encrypted.</p>
    <p>
        MemberSuite imposes strict internal controls over those of its employees with access
        to Customer Information. Such access is granted only on a need to know basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, MemberSuite™ provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered
        each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access,
        maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Changes to Personal Information:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Our software is configured to enable you to give your end users the means to access
        their own personal information for the purposes of deleting it, and/or correcting
        it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Changes to Hosting Privacy Policy:
    </h2>
    <p>
        MemberSuite will update this policy from time to time. A "last revised" date will
        always be included on the bottom of the statement. To keep up-to-date with MemberSuite'
        policy, please check this page periodically.

        ensuring that your data is safe around the clock. MemberSuite devotes significant
        resources to continuously develop our world-class infrastructure. We know that security

        When you subscribe to MemberSuite, you will enjoy unsurpassed protection and peace-of-mind.</p>
    <h3>
        Security Measures
    </h3>
    <li>Continuous deployment of proven, up-to-date security technologies and best practices.</li>
    <li>Ongoing evaluation of emerging security developments and threats. </li>
    <li>Commitment to a secure, scalable, hosted system. </li>
    <li>Security redundancy throughout the MemberSuite architecture. </li>
    <h3>
        World-Class Security</h3>
    <p>
        We deliver a security infrastructure comprised of current, proven, cutting-edge
        technologies. MemberSuite delivers the most comprehensive security available — firewalls
        and encryption devices sourced from leading Internet security vendors, configured
        by expert professionals, and rigorously tested before going into production.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Physical Security</strong><br>
        Production equipment is located in a secure facility which provides 24-hour physical
        security through biometric and visual identification, proximity tracking, and video
        monitoring. Redundant electrical generators, redundant data center chillers and
        other back-up equipment designed to keep servers up and running are continuously
        monitored.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Perimeter Defense</strong><br>
        Perimeters of production and corporate networks are protected by firewalls developed
        by leading security vendors.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Encryption (provided upon request)</strong><br>
        MemberSuite offers 128-bit SSL for secure HTTP connections between client computers
        and our servers.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>User Authentication</strong><br>
        Users access MemberSuite’ client websites only with a valid username and password
        combination, which is optionally encrypted via SSL while in transmission.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Application Security</strong><br>
        Our robust application security model prevents one MemberSuite customer from accessing
        another's data. This security model is reapplied with every request and enforced
        for the entire duration of a user session.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Operating System Security</strong><br>
        MemberSuite enforces tight operating system-level security by using a minimal number
        of entry points to all production servers. All systems are hardened and protected
        with strong passwords, and maintained at each vendor’s recommended patch level.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Database Security</strong><br>
        Whenever possible, database access is controlled at the operating system and enforced
        at the database connection. Direct access to production databases is restricted
        to the production and redundant environments.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Server Management Security</strong><br>
        All data entered into the MemberSuite application by a customer is owned by that
        customer.</p>
    <p>
        MemberSuite employees do not have direct access to the MemberSuite production equipment,
        except where necessary for system management, maintenance, monitoring, and back-ups.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: Use of the MemberSuite™ services are subject to the terms of use in the customer
        license agreement. MemberSuite may change its security infrastructure and/or this
        security data sheet from time to time.
