				Because information is an important part of our business, we understand 
				the importance of the personal information you entrust to us. </span> 
				The following is the privacy statement of Members 1st Federal Credit 
				Union and its affiliated companies that service or have contact with 
				individual members. <span class="Content_red"><b><br>
				<br>
				Member Privacy Is Important To Us<br>
				</b></span>At Members 1st FCU, we are committed to providing members 
				with the finest products backed by consistent top-quality service. 
				And while information is fundamental to our ability to do this, we 
				fully recognize the importance of keeping members' personal and account 
				information secure.<br>
				<br>
				<b><span class="Content_red">Our Commitment to Security</span></b><br>
				Members 1st recognizes how important it is that sensitive information 
				about our members remains confidential. We go to great lengths to 
				safeguard the personal financial information they entrust to us.<br>
				<br>
				We protect member information from unauthorized access, by maintaining 
				physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal 
				regulations to guard your non-public personal information. We actively 
				seek to verify the identity of our members through the use of Personal 
				Identification Numbers (PINs) or other information before assisting 
				them.<br>
				<br>
				We are vigilant in the use of fraud protection measures (including 
				keeping members' PINs, social security and/or Tax ID numbers in the 
				strictest of confidence) in order to protect our members' privacy.<br>
				<br>
				We permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper 
				handling of member information, to have access to that information. 
				Employees who violate our confidentiality policies are subject to 
				strict disciplinary action.<br>
				<b><span><br>
				<span class="Content_red">The Information We Collect</span></span></b><br>
				We collect and use member information obtained from applications and 
				account usage, as well as information derived from other sources. 
				This information is used only to the extent needed to conduct our 
				business and to meet our high quality service standards. We only obtain 
				information in accordance with applicable laws and in response to 
				a member's request for any legitimate business purpose(s).<br>
				<br>
				We make every effort to keep member information files complete, up-to-date, 
				and accurate. We regularly tell our members how and where to access 
				their account information to verify its accuracy. When notified of 
				an error, we promptly make the appropriate correction(s).<br>
				<span class="Content"><br>
				<b><span class="Content_red">The Information We Share</span></b></span><br>
				We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers 
				or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. <br>
				<br>
				<b><span><span class="Content_red">We Respect Members' 
				Personal Privacy</span></span></b><br>
				Even though <b>Members 1st Federal Credit Union does not share non-public 
				personal information with non-affiliated companies,</b> we are providing 
				you with the ability to request that you do not receive certain advertising. 
				Presently, members may receive valuable product and service offers 
				from us and/or our well-established affiliates. We carefully develop 
				these offers to meet our standards and to assure that they reach members 
				most likely to take advantage of the opportunity. To do so, we gather 
				information that may indicate financing and investing preferences 
				to create marketing lists.<br>
				<br>
				At any time, members can contact us to remove their names from these 
				direct marketing, telemarketing and email marketing lists. Members 
				can mail requests for a non-solicitation form to: 
				<ul>
				Members 1st FCU<br>
				Attention: TeleBranch<br>
				P.O. Box 40<br>
				Mechanicsburg, PA 17055 
				</ul>
				Or email us at <a href="javascript:newWindow('EmailSecurity.htm', 'accountinquiries@members1st.org')">AccountInquiries@members1st.org</a> 
				and include their full name and address.
