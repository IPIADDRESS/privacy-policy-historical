                    <br>
                    This Privacy Policy tells you the types of
                    information we collect when you use our Sites or
                    Services, how we use that information, and the
                    instances in which we share your information. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>SUMMARY OF KEY PRINCIPLES</strong> <br>
                    <br>
                    We thought it would be helpful to set out briefly
                    the key ways in which we use your information and
                    how we seek to protect privacy. Of course, you
                    should read the terms of our full Privacy Policy.<br>
                    - We typically collect two kinds of information
                    about you: (a) information that you provide that
                    personally identifies you (e.g., full name or phone
                    number); and (b) information that does not
                    personally identify you (e.g., your IP address or
                    type of browser);<br>
                    - This information is transmitted to, held and
                    processed by us in the United States of America;<br>
                    - We typically use this information to provide you
                    with our website and related services, to deliver
                    targeted advertising based on your preferences and
                    our promotions to you, and to produce reports and
                    data about online shopping;<br>
                    - We may disclose this information to authorized
                    third parties including our merchants, advertising
                    and promotional partners and third party service
                    providers for these purposes;<br>
                    - We work with and permit advertising networks to
                    use anonymous information about you for preference
                    or targeted online advertising (see section III
                    below);<br>
                    - You may at any time opt-out of certain activities
                    as set out below (see section VI);<br>
                    - Our websites use "cookies". You can set your

                    - We encrypt any information you input using Secure
                    Sockets Layer (SSL) software and take reasonable
                    security measures to safeguard information;<br>
                    - If you register with us, you have the ability to
                    update or correct the information you previously
                    provided via the account section;<br>

                    <br>
                    <strong>I. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We collect two kinds of information related to you:
                    (a) Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"); and
                    (b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information
                    ("Non-PII"). <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>(a) Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>
                    PII includes any information that identifies you as
                    person. We collect your PII when you choose to
                    register with us or when you choose to participate
                    in an interactive feature of our Sites such as a
                    review, survey or promotion. You may: (a) provide
                    your name, mail/shipping address, email address,
                    credit card number and phone number when registering
                    with our Sites or in connection with a contest
                    entry; (b) provide certain demographic information
                    about you (e.g., age, gender, shopping interests and
                    preferences, etc.) when participating in a survey or
                    poll; or (c) post a general comment and/or
                    recommendation on our Sites. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>(b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>
                    Non-PII is any information that does not identify
                    you as a person including PII which has been
                    rendered anonymous. We obtain non-PII either
                    separately or together with your PII as described
                    above. We collect certain non-PII from you when you
                    access our Sites including IP addresses and
                    information relating to your browser, operating
                    system, ISP, the third party website from which your
                    visit originated and how you use our Sites such as
                    the web pages you visit, and the duration of your
                    visits. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>II. HOW WE USE &amp; SHARE THE INFORMATION
                      COLLECTED</strong> <br>
                    <br>
                    PII and Non-PII is used to provide, or improve, our
                    Sites and Services to you and to carry out your
                    requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve
                    you and understand your needs, or is used in other
                    ways naturally associated with the circumstances in
                    which you provided the information. <br>
                    <br>
                    We may disclose PII and Non-PII to:<br>
                    (1) our third party service providers who perform
                    functions on our behalf in connection with the
                    operation of the Sites or Services e.g., providers
                    who host and manage data, process credit card
                    orders, deliver our merchandise, etc; <br>
                    <br>
                    (2) participating sponsors to a program or promotion
                    you enter through our Sites or Services; <br>

                    <br>
                    (4) co-promotional partners and others with whom we
                    have marketing or other relationships; <br>
                    <br>
                    (5) participating merchants where you consent at the
                    time you submit PII to us when using the interactive
                    features of our Sites such as surveys and reviews
                    concerning our participating merchants; and <br>
                    <br>
                    (6) our other users where you choose to publicly

                    boards, bulletin boards, etc.).<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, we use non-PII to help analyze site
                    traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry
                    out targeted promotional activities (see "Preference
                    Based Advertising" below). We may use your non-PII
                    by itself or aggregate it with information we have
                    obtained from others to produce research reports and
                    other information and data about online shopping for
                    participating merchants and other customers, as well
                    as media and other interested parties. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>III. COOKIES AND PREFERENCE BASED
                      ADVERTISING</strong> <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>(a) Cookies and Web Beacons:</strong> We
                    automatically receive and store certain types of
                    non-PII whenever you interact with us by using
                    "cookies" and analogous technology. "Cookies" are
                    small files that we place on your computer or your
                    Web browser memory to enable our systems to
                    recognize your browser and to provide convenience
                    and other features to you. <strong>It is important
                      to note that the cookies that we use do not
                      contain and are not tied to PII about you.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You may be able to direct your internet browser not
                    to allow cookies and you can delete existing cookies
                    from your computer. Please note, however, some
                    elements of our Sites will not function properly or
                    be available to you. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>(b) Preference Based Advertising:</strong>
                    We work with third parties, including advertising
                    companies and website analysis firms, who use
                    cookies to collect non-PII when you visit our Sites
                    and third party sites about your surfing activities.
                    This non-PII, collected through cookies, is
                    typically used by these third party advertising
                    networks to serve you with advertisements while on
                    third party sites tailored to meet your preferences
                    and likely interests. If you do not wish to
                    participate in this activity, please click here and
                    follow the simple opt-out process. <br>
                    <br>
                    A couple of important notes about this opt-out tool:
                    (1) it includes all the advertising networks that
                    Shopzilla works with, but also many that Shopzilla
                    does not work with; and (2) it relies on cookies to
                    ensure that a given advertising network does not
                    collect information about you ("Opt-out Cookies") -
                    for a general explanation of how Opt-out Cookies
                    work, please click here . Therefore, if you buy a
                    new computer, change web browsers or delete these
                    Opt-out Cookies from your computer, you will need to
                    perform the opt-out task again. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>IV. SALE OF BUSINESS AND DISCLOSURE BY LAW</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>(a) Business Transactions:</strong> We may
                    disclose PII and Non-PII held by us: (a) to a
                    prospective seller or actual seller of any business
                    or assets we acquire; (b) if all or any of our
                    assets are acquired by a third party, in which case,
                    PII and Non-PII may be one of the transferred
                    assets. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>(b) Required disclosures:</strong> We may
                    disclose and use any PII or non-PII if we are
                    required to do so by law, with respect to copyright
                    and other intellectual property infringement claims,
                    or if we believe that such action is necessary to:
                    (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with
                    the requirements of the law or legal process; (c)
                    protect or defend our legal rights or property, our
                    Sites, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to
                    protect the health and safety of our Sites's users
                    or the general public. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>V. SECURITY OF INFORMATION</strong> <br>
                    <br>
                    We work to protect the security of your information
                    during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer
                    (SSL) software, which encrypts information you
                    input. We also use a secure server hosting location
                    in the US, firewall protection, controlled access
                    and encryption technology to protect your data.
                    Please be advised, however, that while we strive to
                    protect your PII, we cannot guarantee or warrant the
                    security of any information you disclose or transmit
                    to us online and are not responsible for the theft,
                    destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your PII.
                    In the unfortunate event that your personally
                    identifiable information is compromised, we will
                    notify you by e-mail to the last e-mail address you
                    have provided us as soon as feasible under the
                    circumstances (delays in notification may occur
                    while we take necessary measures to determine the
                    scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity
                    to the system, as well as for the legitimate needs
                    of law enforcement if notification would impede a
                    criminal investigation). <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>VI. YOUR OPTIONS &amp; OPT-OUTS</strong> <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>(a) What Information Can I Access?</strong>
                    If you register as a Shopzilla member, you will
                    typically have access to an account section that
                    includes the registration information you previously
                    provided which you can update or correct at any
                    time. If there is any inaccurate information that
                    you are not able to correct, just let us know. Also,
                    if you wish, you can delete your membership account
