				<h2>Privacy Notice for hue</h2>
<p>Philips believes strongly in protecting the privacy of the personal data you share with us. We also believe it is important to inform you about how we will use your personal data, and to give you choices about how those data will be used. Therefore, we encourage you to read this Privacy Notice carefully, before you make your choices and give us the right to use your data as stated in this Privacy Notice.</p>
<h4>Scope of this Privacy Notice</h4>
<p>This privacy notice ("Privacy Notice") applies to all personal data of consumers collected via the use of the hue lamps and bridge (“Products”), www.meethue.com (“Web Site”) and the hue application (“App”), that are controlled by or under the control of Koninklijke Philips N.V. or any of its subsidiaries (”Philips”), together referred to as the “Services”.</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice applies in addition to any terms and conditions and other policies of Philips for the Services.</p>
<p>Please note that you can use the Products from within your home via the App “Local Access”. In order to also use the Products from outside your home you will need to have a hue account, which you can create on the Web Site “Remote Access”. With a hue account you will be able to control your Products from within and from outside the home, via the App and via the Web Site. It is important for you to know that once you have created a hue account you will always access the Products via the Remote Access mode also when using the Products within the home, unless you reset your bridge. This is important for you to know, as different sets of data are being collected in the Local Access and Remote Access mode.</p>
<h4>Why should you share your personal data with Philips?</h4>
<p>At Philips we use best in class data security tools to keep your data safe and protect hue from unauthorized access. Sharing your personal data with us is necessary for us in order to provide you with the services that you have purchased from us, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the Products within or from outside the home;</li>
<li>Use other applications, products and functionalities made available by Philips or third parties that can be connected to the Services;</li>
<li>Assist you with after sales services;</li>
<li>Save time by storing your preferences;</li>
<li>Benefit from software updates;</li>
<li>Help us to develop products that are designed around you, optimize customer services and continuously improve our Services</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, if you choose to register yourself for an additional service we will also be able to provide you with the following (depending on the service):</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate in a personal and timely manner, such as responding to your request for contact;</li>
<li>Register your purchase so you can receive all the benefits to which your purchase entitles you;</li>
<li>Participate in online communities;</li>
<li>Receive personalized messages, information and special offers that are relevant to your interests;</li>
</ul>
<h4>How we collect your personal data and which personal data we collect</h4>
<p>You can share your personal data with us in a number of ways, for instance by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the Web Site or App to access or modify your settings or to upload scenes or images</li>
<li>Creating an account on www.meethue.com</li>
<li>Connecting the Products with your WIFI network (IP address is registered).</li>
<li>Or when you actively choose to make use of additional services from us, such as participating in promotions, subscribing to a newsletter, or registering your product.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have purchased the Products and you will use the Products in the Local Access mode we will collect the following information of you:</p>
<ul>
<li>internal IP address,</li>
<li>external IP address,</li>
<li>button press events,</li>
<li>software versions of the bridge,</li>
<li>unique ID of the bridge,</li>
<li>serial number of the bridge</li>
</ul>
<p>This information will be stored as long as necessary for running the operation, thereafter this information will be anonymized.</p>
<p>If you choose to register and create a hue account Philips will also collect and store additionally the following personal data of you:</p>
<ul>
<li>email address,</li>
<li>password, nickname,</li>
<li>usage data of the Services,</li>
<li>IP address,</li>
<li>configuration of your Products,</li>
<li>scenes and images you choose to upload.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also when you use the App or Web Site we will collect the usage data and the crash incident data. We will store this usage data also for providing you with appropriate after sales services and troubleshooting. The usage data is stored for as long as needed to provide the services to you and thereafter anonyized.</p>
<p>If you have agreed to use a feature for which it is necessary to keep your usage data longer (for example if you want to track the energy usage of your lamps over a longer period of time) we will retain the usage data of your bridge ID as long as necessary to fulfil that service to you.</p>
<h4>Do we share information on the Products with third parties?</h4>
<p>If you choose to use a product, application or other services from a third party that can be connected to our Products Philips will share information on the configuration of your Products to these third parties. Note that these third parties often have their own privacy policies that apply to the way they use your personal data. These privacy policies sometimes differ from the Philips Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>We may share this personal data with service providers, business partners and others, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p>For example, Philips may sell you a product or offer you a service in a joint marketing effort with another company (Business Partner). We will let you know that such relationship exists and who these companies are, prior to processing your data for such joint marketing efforts.</p>
<p>If we are required by law to obtain your consent, or otherwise believe that your consent is appropriate in the circumstances, we will obtain your consent before we share your personal data.</p>
<p>Our agreements with these Business Partners will limit the purposes for which your personal data can be used and disclosed, and will require your personal data to be adequately safeguarded.</p>
<p>Philips will disclose personal data only under this policy and/or when required by law.</p>
<p>Philips sometimes sells a business or a part of a business to another company. Such a transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business, to the purchasing company.</p>
