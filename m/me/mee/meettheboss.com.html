        <p>GDS Publishing Ltd is strongly committed to protecting your privacy while interacting with our content, products and services in a safe and secure environment.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to tell you what kind of information we may gather about you when you visit our site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct this information. Our policy allows you to choose what kind of and how much information you provide to us and to control how we use whatever information you give us. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying experience while allowing you to control your privacy and giving you a means to voice any questions or concerns you may have.</p>
        <p>This policy applies only to <a href="http://www.meettheboss.com">www.meettheboss.com</a> and <a href="http://www.meetheboss.tv">www.meettheboss.tv</a> and not to any external websites to which they are linked.</p>

        <h4>Collection of information</h4>
        <p>Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked to provide information such as your name, email address or information about what you like and do not like. It is entirely your choice whether to respond to these questions or not.</p>
        <p>GDS Publishing Ltd websites collects two types of information. The first type is anonymous information. For instance, we may collect information to tell us that five thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their date of birth - they are 'anonymous' to us. Another example of GDS Publishing Ltd websites collecting anonymous information is when the GDS Publishing Ltd are invited to respond to surveys on GDS Publishing Ltd websites. The surveys may ask you for demographic information such as your age, gender and postcode. This information is collected for research purposes, is used in the aggregate (where possible) and remains anonymous. Many of the individuals who access our services are anonymous to us.</p>
        <p>The second type of information that GDS Publishing Ltd websites collect is personal information. GDS Publishing Ltd websites will collect personal information that lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address or postal address, when you provide it to us.

Certain information may be required, such as your name, age, internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number, in order to provide that service or product to you.

        <p>How much of your personal information that you choose to disclose to the GDS Publishing Ltd is completely up to you.
