<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>


<p class="MsoNormal">Your privacy is very important to us and we will treat your
data with care and respect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We know that
you care how information and data about you is collected, used, and shared.
This Privacy Statement describes our privacy policy and details how we collect,
use, and/or disseminate the information you provide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We reserve the right to change this Statement
at any time and urge you to review our Statement regularly to familiarize
yourself with any changes.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By visiting our website, using our online products/services, downloading/installing and/or using our application on a mobile phone, and/or by voluntarily submitting information to us via online forms, advertisement responses, mobile applications, and/or electronic mail, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Who We Are<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
MeetingBurner has developed and licenses a subscription-based service
that allows a host/presenter to share the contents of his computer monitor, his
video camera, and his voice with other participants. &nbsp;All of this is
conducted via the internet and/or with our optional phone bridge add-on.
&nbsp;The host can configure his account so that participants can see a logo, a
picture of the presenter, meeting information, participant lists, or other
information as the host/presenter chooses. &nbsp;In addition, we allow the
participants to ask electronic questions of the host.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Due to the fact that each online
meeting is controlled by an independent host/presenter, we cannot guarantee how
the system and privacy information will be managed by the
independent host/presenter.<br>
<br>
To provide the service, we may be required to collect, use, and share certain
information. The type of information we collect, together with a description of
how we use and/or share it, is described below.<br>
<br>
<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
<br>
<b>Information Collection</b><br>
MeetingBurner, our partners, and the independent presenter/host who subscribes
to MeetingBurner are the owners of the information collected on our site.<br>
<br>
Registration<br>
In order to use the site, a user must first complete the registration form. <span class="GramE">During registration a user is required to give contact
information (such as name and email address).</span> We use this information to
contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed
interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such
as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as, username and
password), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on
our site. <br>
<br>
Order<br>
<span class="GramE">We</span> request information from the user on our order
form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and
shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number,
expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill
customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used
to contact the user.<br>
<br>
<b>Information Use</b><br>
<br>
<span class="GramE">We</span> will use personal information that we gather about
you to provide the services that you have requested. In addition, if you have a
free account with MeetingBurner, then we will use the information gathered about
you to share more information about our business in an attempt to convince you
to make a purchase from us or our associated companies. MeetingBurner and, if
you are a participant in a online meeting, the host/presenter who sent you to
this site, will be granted access to your personal contact (name, phone number,
and email) information so that they can communicate with you in an attempt to
"sell" various products, services, and memberships to you.<br>
<br>
<b>Profile</b><br>
<span class="GramE">We</span> store information that we collect through cookies,
log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A
profile is stored information that we keep on individual users <span class="GramE">that details</span> their viewing preferences. Consequently,
collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information
to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile
is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web <span class="GramE">site,</span> and
to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do share your profile with
other third parties. Your profile is shared together with your personally
identifiable information. YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION IS NEVER SHARED FOR ANY
REASON WITH ANY OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW.<br>
<br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
<span class="GramE">A</span> cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer
tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and
persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser,
the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored
on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can
be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.<br>
<br>
By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more
than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie,
they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be
limited in some areas of our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and
target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the
'Profile' section.<br>
<br>
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example,
advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once
we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising<br>
<br>
<b>Log Files</b><br>
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet
protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to
analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate,
and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc.
are not linked to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to
personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service.<br>
<br>
<b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons, Web Bugs, CSS, and similar functionality)</b><br>
We employ or our third party advertising company employs a software technology
called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage
content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are
tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are
used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between
the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller,
about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied
to users' <span class="GramE">personally</span> identifiable information.<br>
<br>
Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are
both from the same Web site or advertising company. That means, for example,
that if a person visited '<span class="GramE">www.companyX.com',</span> which
uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site or advertising company
would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID
number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected
information would then be given to the advertising company or Web site.<br>
<br>
In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which
emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the
effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing
campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the
Opt-out section. <br>
<br>
<b>Communications from the Site</b><br>
Special Offers and Updates<br>
<span class="GramE">We</span> send all new members a welcoming email to verify
password and username. Established members will occasionally receive
information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter.<br>
<br>
Service Announcements<br>
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related
announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for
maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of
these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these
communications are not promotional in nature. <br>
<br>
Customer Service<br>
<span class="GramE">We</span> communicate with users on a regular basis to
provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account
we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.<br>
<br>
<b>Sharing</b><br>
Legal Disclaimer<br>
<span class="GramE">Though</span> we make every effort to preserve user privacy,
we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we
have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current
judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.<br>
<br>
Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable<span class="GramE">)</span><br>
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.
This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
Third Party Advertisers<span class="GramE">:</span><br>
We may use the information you have voluntarily provided to cause information,
offers, products, and/or services that appear to us to be consistent with your
expressed interests to be directed to you. This is typically accomplished by
using your information to direct to you information, offers, products, and/or
services from us and/or one of our affiliated companies. Your information may,
therefore, ultimately be used for marketing purposes by us, our affiliated
companies, and/or any one or more of the associated businesses with which we work,
or by the host/presenter of an event. <br>
<br>
We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally
identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise
described in this Privacy Statement. For example, we may be forced to disclose
information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or
third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private
communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about
you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole
discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.<br>
<br>
After we share your information with our affiliated companies and/or any of the
several businesses with which we work, or with the host/presenter of an event
in which you have chosen to participate, we lose control over how they will
use, collect, and/or disseminate your information. Accordingly, we recommend
that you review the Privacy Statements of the corresponding affiliated
companies with whom we have shared your information in order to acquaint
yourself with their information collection, use, and/or sharing policies. <br>
<br>
You understand and agree that MeetingBurner is not responsible for the privacy
practices or the content of the host/presenter and/or these other websites, and
you agree that MeetingBurner is not responsible for how such information is
ultimately used.<br>
<br>
<b>These are the instances in which we will share users' personal information<span class="GramE">:</span></b><br>
We Share Personal Contact Information with third parties, including the
host/presenter of an event. If you want to ensure that your information is
never shared with any third party, you must request to be unsubscribed or
cancelled from our service. Failure to unsubscribe or cancel your service will
imply that you are interested in having your personal information shared with
various third parties.<br>
<br>
Third Party Intermediaries<br>
<span class="GramE">We</span> use an outside credit card processing company to
bill users for goods and services. These companies do not <span class="GramE">retain,</span>
share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary
purposes.<br>
<br>
Service Providers<br>
<span class="GramE">We</span> partner with other third parties to provide
specific services. When the user signs up for these particular services, we
share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party
to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use
personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these
services and for purposes referenced in their privacy policies.<br>
<br>
Business Transitions<br>
In the event MeetingBurner goes through a business transition, such as a
merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets,
users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets
transferred. Users will be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or
control of their personal information. If as a result of the business
transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a
manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given
choice consistent with our notification of changes section.<br>
<br>
<b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used
for purposes not directly related to our site only by completely opting-out of
our service and/or canceling a paid subscription to our service.<br>
<br>
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional
communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the
unsubscribe instructions sent with every email. <br>
<br>
<b>Links</b><br>
This Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we, MeetingBurner,
are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage
our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy
statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable
information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by
this Web site.<br>
<br>
<b>Children's privacy</b><br>
<span class="GramE">Protecting</span> the privacy of the young is important to
us. Therefore, you cannot use this site if you are not 18 years old. If you are
not 18 years old, you are not permitted to access this website for any reason.
Because of this, we never knowingly collect or maintain information at our
website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is
structured to attract anyone under the age of 18.<br>
<br>
<b>Telecommunications privacy</b> Protecting the privacy of your
telecommunications information is important to us. When members or prospects
make phone calls to telecommunication services provided by us, we may track
information about the name, phone number, and other information about the
calling party. In addition, we may gather information about telecommunication
services used by our members. By contacting us via telephone you are allowing
us to contact you even if your phone number is on any legal DNC (do not call)
lists. <br>
<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
<!--This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When
users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is
protected both online and off-line.<br>-->
</p><p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, we strive to ensure 
that their information is protected both online and off-line. 
However, please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet or 
information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="GramE">When our registration/order form asks users to enter
sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number),
that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption
software in the industry - SSL.</span> While on a secure page, such as our
order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to
un-locked, or open, when users are just "surfing".<br>
<br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do
everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. <span class="GramE">All of our users'</span> <span class="GramE">information</span>, not
just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example,
our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to
personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected
screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter
their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL
employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every
quarter, as well as any time new policies <span class="GramE">are</span> added,
our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on
privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' <span class="GramE">information</span>
is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable
information are in a secure environment, in a secure facility.<br>
<br>
If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send
an email to support@meetingburner.com.<br>
<br>
<b>Supplementation of Information</b><br>
In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is
necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from
3rd party sources.<br>
<br>
<b>Enhancement of Marketing Profile</b><br>
We may purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user
database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think
our users would be interested in. We use this information to enhance or overlay
the "profile" of individual users. This aggregate marketing data is therefore
tied to the users' personally identifiable information. See also the 'Profile'.<br>
<br>
<b>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</b><br>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), if a user no longer wishes to use our service, or otherwises wishes to review the user's personally identifiable information, a user may review, correct, update, or delete/deactivate the user's personally identifiable information by logging in to the user's account, or for additional assistance, by contacting support at support@meetingburner.com<br>
<br>
<span class="GramE"><b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
statement in places that we deem appropriate.</span> We will use information in
accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.<br>
<br>
If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in
a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify
users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their
information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all
communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they
will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new
manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices
that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will
post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some
cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to
receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy
practices.
