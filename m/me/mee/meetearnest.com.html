We do not necessarily have access to or control over the cookies they use, but you may be able to opt out of some of their practices by visiting the following links: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, <a href="http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&amp;popup=1&amp;locale=en_US&amp;second=1&amp;second_has_cookie=0">Omniture</a>, <a href="http://rt.displaymarketplace.com/optout.html">Aperture</a>, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>, and <a href="http://privacychoice.org/trackerblock">PrivacyChoice</a>.

                <p>
                  Earnest may also use certain remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites to previous visitors to our site. This means that we may advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site (like completing a loan application). This could be in the form of an advertisement on a search results page, or a site in the network of our remarketing partners.
                </p>
                <p class="subheader">Partners &amp; Service Providers</p>
                <p>
                  Some of the services that are offered through the Earnest site may be provided by third-party partners, like Experian. We may also outsource some of Earnest’s functions to third-party providers, such as data storage providers, platform administrators, credit bureaus, collection agencies, loan servicers, payment processing functions, and/or other services. We may share information from or about you with these third-party providers so that they can perform the requested services or complete your requests.
                </p>
                <p class="subheader">Third-party Accounts</p>
                <p>
                  You can connect your loan application to your accounts on third-party services, like LinkedIn, in which case we may collect and store information identifying your account with the third-party service. We may use the information to inform your application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you connect an account with us, you are requesting our third-party financial aggregator, Intuit, to create a new 'token' for Earnest. That token gives access to view account information without giving permissions to perform any other action inside that account.
                </p>
                <p class="subheader">Aggregated Information</p>
                <p>
                  We may share aggregated, non-identifiable user information with third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on advertisements.
                </p>
                <p class="subheader">Business Transfers</p>
                <p>
                  We may share information from or about you with subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If Earnest is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
                </p>
                <p class="subheader">Links</p>
                <p>
                  The Earnest site may contain links to unaffiliated third-party websites. Except as described in this policy, we do not share your personal information with them, and are not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy policies on all such third-party websites.
                </p>
                <p class="subheader">Law Enforcement</p>
                <p>
                  We may disclose information from or about you if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure is (a) reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on us; (b) helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Site; or (c) protect our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public.

                <p class="plain-english">Earnest takes your privacy and security seriously. We have enabled HTTPS access to our site, in addition to SSL technology, and your login information of your financial accounts is not accessible to anyone at Earnest. This data is stored offsite. Additionally, there are a number of precautions you can take to protect the security of your computer, including selecting a strong Earnest password and not sharing it with anyone.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Earnest takes steps to safeguard your personal information through vigorous physical, electronic, and operational policies and practices:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Session Time-Outs: We employ session time-outs to protect your account.  You will be logged out of the site after thirty minutes. This reduces the risk of others being able to access your account if you leave your computer unattended.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Protection of Account Numbers: After you have entered your account numbers, we will never display your account number.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Passwords: At a minimum, we require the use of both numbers and letters in your password. We have also instituted secure steps by which you can regain access to your account should you forget your password, including email reset. Your password is not known to any employee or third party with whom we may partner, and we will never ask you for your passwords as a means of identifying yourself. If you ever receive an email purporting to come from Earnest that asks for your password, you should immediately report this to <a href="mailto:hello@meetearnest.com">hello@meetearnest.com</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Secure, Off-Site Hosting: We store your personal and sensitive financial data such as Social Security numbers and bank accounts in a virtual private cloud hosted by Amazon Web Services.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Defined Service Access points: Data can only be read or written through defined service access points, the use of which is password-protected and limited to only those employees or third parties who have a need to know.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Secure Socket Layer certificate technology: We equip our servers with SSL certificate technology to provide a safe and secure channel to visit the Earnest site.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Data encryption: SSL also ensures that all data entered into the Earnest site is encrypted. For further encryption protection, we require a 128-bit secure browser for logins and transactions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Network firewalls: There is no inbound communication allowed between data and application servers and the Internet.

              <section>
                <p>To protect your account, Earnest may send you notifications that confirm actions taken on your account. These notifications are typically sent to notify you of a change in status, or for legal or security purposes. For example, you may receive notifications confirming your registration and the successful submission of loan requests, as well as requests from us for additional information and reminders to sign your loan agreement.</p>
                <p>You cannot opt out of these notifications as they are in place to protect the security of your account and personal information. We do this for your own protection so that you can be sure no one else is making changes to your account without your knowledge. However, the security offered by these notifications can be undermined if other people have access to your email account.</p>
                <p>Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Site. Even under the best of circumstances, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Any transmission of personal information is done at your own risk. In the event of a data breach, we will comply with the notification guidelines required by federal law as well as the laws of each state in which we do business.</p>
