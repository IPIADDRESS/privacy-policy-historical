users and cause notifications to be sent to other users notifying them that you are proximate to them.
The messaging to other users with whom you are matched may include your (real-time) distance from
them as well as your profile and photograph. On the Site, your location may be abstracted from
the mobile Web browser when you visit the Site. You may also choose on some phones to enter
your location manually in to the Site. meetMoi
will never share your exact location with another user. We don't share your email address, mobile
phone number, billing information, or account password with another user under any circumstances.
All other information you provide us may be revealed in your profile and be accessible to other members.

transaction and providing express consent to apply such charges to your account.

We may also collect other users' comments about you in our complaints department.
</li>
<li>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about meetMoi
Services, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend an email
inviting him or her to visit the meetMoi Services.
meetMoi stores this information for the sole purpose of sending
this email and tracking the success of our referral program. We may send them a reminder email in the future.

analyze meetMoi Services usage, to improve our content and product
offerings as well as to customize the meetMoi Services's content and layout.</li>
<li>We also may send account updates, periodic informational updates or marketing messages to our members via email, SMS
or the native messaging capabilities of your device. You may choose at any time to remove yourself from receiving such
messages by changing your preferences in your account settings.</li>
<li>We use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement.</li>
</ol>
</li>

legal process served on the meetMoi Services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Your use of Other Users' Information. You may not use other user's information for commercial purposes, to spam, to
harass, or to make unlawful threats. meetMoi reserves the
right to terminate the accounts of those who misuse other user's information or who otherwise violate
the meetMoi Terms of Use.
</li>
<li>
Control of Your Password. You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any
third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial
control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions
taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should
immediately change your password.

Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information. Once you register, you will be able
to review and change much of your personally identifiable information at

password, and profile. Please promptly update your information if it changes by logging in to your
account. We strongly urge you to periodically change your password to help reduce the risk of
unauthorized access to your account information. Upon your request, we will remove your credit
card number and credit card expiration date from our main databases. To make this request, email
us at Customer Service. We will retain in our files information, including credit card information,
you have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot
problems, comply with Credit Card Merchant Banking and Association Agreements, enhance security,
reduce fraud, comply with Federal and State Law, and to enforce our Terms of Use Agreement.
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may
employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure
advertising effectiveness. If and when we do this, we'll revise this Privacy Policy and provide
more information about this practice and your choices regarding it.
