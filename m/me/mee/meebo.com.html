	<p><b>MEEBO.COM</b>
	<br><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b>
	</p></div>
<p>Last Updated: March 13, 2009
</p><p> Meebo, Inc. ("Meebo") owns and runs various websites, including but not limited to meebo.com, meeborooms.com, meebome.com, and gomeebo.com (the "Websites"), through which it offers various services and software (the Websites, services and software are referred to as the "Services"). Meebo also offers Services, such Community IM and Meebo Rooms, through partner websites and through websites that have embedded our Services.

</p><p> A link to this privacy policy is included on the homepage of each of the Websites. Meebo respects the privacy of its users. This document explains how Meebo will use the information that you provide to us via the Services. Meebo may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If Meebo does so, the revised Privacy Policy will be posted on the Websites. 


</p><p><b>1.	Information Collected.</b> You are not required to provide personally identifiable information to visit the Websites. However, in order to take advantage of certain features you may need to provide some personally identifiable information.
</p><ul>

	<li> <i>Account Information.</i> To create an account on Meebo, we require you to provide your name, email address, age and gender, to create a user name and to provide a password.
	</li><li> <i>Third Party IM Service User Names and Passwords.</i> Meebo allows you to access third party IM services by logging into your account through Meebo (the "Third Party IM Services"). In order to access your Third Party IM Service account, you must enter your applicable user name(s) and password(s) on the Meebo Service. To use the basic IM services on the Websites, Meebo does not store the password(s) of your Third Party IM Service accounts on our server. If you wish to utilize advanced features of the Services, such as automatic sign-in, storage of your password(s) may be necessary. 
	</li><li> <i> Third Party IM Services.</i> Meebo may receive information about you from the Third Party IM Services that you access through Meebo. This information could include your username, password, friends list, status, profile information and demographic information (described below). Meebo may use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy when it provides services to you.
	</li><li> <i>Aggregate Usage Data and Anonymized Data.</i> Meebo may collect usage data based on users. usage of the site and its various features, but it is not personally identifiable except as described below under the IP Addresses section ("Aggregate Data"). In addition, Meebo may take your personal information and create anonymized information by excluding information (such as your user name) that makes it personally identifiable to you ("Anonymized Data").
	</li><li> <i>Personal Information for Social Features.</i> From time to time, Meebo introduces features that allow friends to share more information about themselves with other friends, including information about what they are doing on Meebo. Meebo may store the personally identifiable information that you provide us in order to provide these services, including your friends list. Whenever a social feature involves the disclosure of personally identifiable information about you to other people, Meebo will either provide you with an opportunity to opt out of the disclosure or will seek your consent prior to making the disclosure. 
	</li><li> <i>File Transfer.</i> When you use the file transfer feature of Meebo, the file that you transfer is copied and retained on the servers of our third party service provider for a period of time following the transfer. Neither Meebo nor the third party service provider accesses or uses these files for any purpose, but you should be aware that these files are not encrypted and that they could be disclosed in legal proceedings or investigations under Sections 5(f) and (g). 
	</li><li> <i>Platform Applications.</i> Meebo has entered into agreements with third party developers ("Developers") to make their applications available through the Meebo Platform so that you can use them through the Meebo Services (the "Platform Applications"). In order to enable the Platform Applications, Meebo may need to provide the Developers with your Meebo user name or other personally identifiable information that is related to your use of the Platform Applications. Meebo requires that the Developers only use this information to provide the Platform Applications to you and that they not disclose it to any third party. 
	<br>In addition, some of the Platform Applications may collect personally identifiable information from you directly. In that case, any information that you provide through the Platform Application will be governed by the Developer's privacy policy, which you should review carefully before using the Platform Application. Each Developer will be solely responsible for complying with its own privacy policy. 
	<a style="color:#677788" ;="" name="communityim"></a></li><li><a style="color:#677788" ;="" name="communityim"> <i>Community IM.</i> Meebo has partnered with various community websites to enable those websites to offer IM within their community (such as Flixster, myYearbook) ("Community IM"). If you have an account with one of those community websites and you use the Meebo-powered Community IM on that site, that site may provide Meebo with your user name on the community website as well as non-personally identifiable information about you such as your gender, age, and interests. Meebo may also offer you the ability to log onto your Third Party IM Service account through the Community IM.</a>
	</li><li> <i>Meebo Rooms</i> Meebo offers a multi-party chat service known as Meebo Rooms. Meebo Rooms can be found on the Websites and on numerous third party websites. When you use a Meebo Room, you are asked to create a screen name and to provide demographic information about yourself, such as age and gender. Meebo then creates a cookie that enables Meebo to identify you when you visit any Meebo Room, even if it is on a different website from the one where you created the screen name. When you visit a page that has a Meebo Room embedded into it, you will appear in that room under your Meebo Room screen name, with two exceptions:
<br>- If the Meebo Room is on a partner site where you have a user account, you may appear under your user name for that site.
<br>- If you are logged into your Meebo account on the Websites, you will appear in Meebo Rooms on the Websites under your Meebo user name.
<br>Other than in those two cases, you can change your screen name at any time and as many times as you would like through any Meebo Room.
	</li><li> <i>Demographic and Geographic Data.</i> Meebo may ask people to voluntarily provide additional demographic information such as age, gender, location, and interests, or we may require it for you to use certain features. We use demographic information to improve our services and to provide you with features like customized advertising. In addition, Meebo may receive geographic or demographic information from outside sources. These sources may include companies whom we have engaged in accordance with Section 5 to provide that information based on information that you have provided to us, from our Community IM partners, from the third-party messenger services that you access through Meebo, or from other partners such as in connection with a co-branded website or a promotion. Meebo may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Websites.
