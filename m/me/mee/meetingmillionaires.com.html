MEETING MILLIONAIRES has created this Privacy Statement (Policy)
in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to helping our users
better understand what information we collect about them and what
may happen to that information.<br><br>

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination
practices for the Websites listed below.<br><br>

<b>Overview</b><br><br>

As part of the normal operation of our services we collect
and, in some cases, may disclose information about you. This Privacy
Policy describes the information we collect about you and what
may happen to that information. By accepting this Privacy Policy
and our Terms and Conditions, you expressly consent to our use
and disclosure of your personal information in the manner prescribed
in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into
and subject to the terms of the MEETING MILLIONAIRES Terms and Conditions.<br><br>

This Privacy Statement applies to all MEETING MILLIONAIRES sites.
All other MEETING MILLIONAIRES  worldwide sites operate under similar
privacy practices as described in this Privacy Policy, and subject
to the requirements of applicable local law, we strive to provide
a consistent set of privacy practices throughout the MEETING MILLIONAIRES
online personals sites.<br><br>

<b>1. A Special Note About Children</b><br><br>

Children are not eligible to use our services, and we ask that
minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information
to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction
with your parents or guardians.<br><br>

<b>2. Information We Collect</b><br><br>

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide
you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This
allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet
your needs and to customize our service to make your experience
easier. You agree that in order to assist our members to meet
each other we may feature members' profiles in our editorials
and newsletters that we send out from time to time to our members.
Your name, address and telephone number are confidential and will
not be posted in your profile. Your profile is available for other
members to view. Members' profiles include a description and photos,
likes and dislikes, individual essays and other information helpful
in determining matches. Your viewable profile does not include
any identifying information about you, except the username you
chose upon registering.<br><br>

Please note that your personally identifiable information will
be stored and processed on our computers in the United States.
The laws on holding personal data in the United States may differ
from the European laws but as we explain below, We will hold and
transmit your information in a safe, confidential and secure environment.<br><br>

We automatically track certain information based upon your
behavior on our Websites using cookies and other devices. We use
this information for internal research on our members' demographics,
interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and
our community. This information may include the URL that you just
came from (whether this URL is on our site or not). Which URL
you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what
browser you are using, and your IP address.<br><br>

We use data collection devices such as "cookies"
on certain pages of our Websites. "Cookies" are small
files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized
services. We also offer certain features that are only available
through the use of a "cookie". Cookies can also help
us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Most
cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are
automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits.<br><br>

We use a third party advertising company, to serve ads on our
behalf across the Internet. The third party may also collect anonymous
information about your visits to our Web site. This is primarily
accomplished through the use of a technology device, commonly
referred to as a Web beacon or an action tag, which we place on
various Web pages within our Web site or in an html e-mail that
allows Atlas DMT to collect anonymous information. Atlas DMT may
use information about your visits to this and other Web sites
in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to
you.<br><br>

<b>3. Our Use of Your Information</b><br><br>

We use information in the files we maintain about you, and
the other information we obtain from your current and past activities
on the Websites to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and
enforce our Terms and Conditions. At times, we may look across
multiple members to identify problems or resolve disputes, and
in particular we may examine your information to identify members
multiple Member ID No. or aliases.<br><br>

You agree that we may use personally identifiable information
about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to
analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings,
and customize our Site's content, layout, and services. These
uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your needs.<br><br>

You agree that we may use your information to contact you and
deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to
your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative
notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your
use on the Websites. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly
agree to receive this information.<br><br>

<b>4. Our Disclosure of Your Information</b><br><br>

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure
that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable
information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described
in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and
foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government,
law enforcement agencies or third parties. Under certain circumstances,
third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions
or private communications, or members may abuse or misuse your
information that they collect from our Websites. Therefore, although
we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we
do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally
identifiable information or private communications will always
remain private.<br><br>

As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally
identifiable information about you to any third party. However,
the following describes some of the ways that your personally
identifiable information may be disclosed.<br><br>

Financial Information. Under some circumstances we may require
some additional information, such as, but not limited to credit
card details. We use this financial information, including your
name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for
use of our services. We use your financial information to check
your qualifications, to bill you for services and/or products,
to enable you to participate in discount, rebate and similar programs
in which you may elect to participate. By making a purchase, or
engaging in any other kind of activity or transaction that uses
financial information on the Websites, you consent to our providing
of your financial information to our service providers and to
such third parties as we determine are necessary to support and
process your activities and transactions, as well as to your credit
card issuer for their purposes. These third parties may include
the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process
and support the transaction or activity. By purchasing, or registering
or making reservations for products or services of third parties
offered on the Websites, or by participating in programs offered
on the Websites that are administered by third parties and that
require you to submit financial information in order to use them,
you also consent to our providing your financial information to
those third parties. Any of these various third parties may be
authorized to use your financial information in accordance with
our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance
with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control,
and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of
their actions or omissions. Additionally, you agree that we may
use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third
parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and
disclose any other information that you submit to us.<br><br>

Advertisers. We aggregate (gather up data across all our members'
accounts) personally identifiable information and disclose such
information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers
and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes.
However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities
any information that could be used to identify you personally.
Certain information, such as your name, email address, password,
credit card number and bank account number, are never disclosed
to marketing advertisers. We may use third-party advertising companies
to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies
and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons)
to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these
third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely
anonymous.<br><br>

External Service Providers. There may be a number of services
offered by external service providers that help you use our Websites.
If you choose to use these optional services, and in the course
of doing so, disclose information to the external service providers,
and/or grant them permission to collect information about you,
then their use of your information is governed by their private
policy.<br><br>

Other Corporate Entities. We share much of our data, including
personally identifiable information about you, with our parent
and/or subsidiaries that are committed to serving your online
needs and related services, throughout the world. To the extent
that these entities have access to your information, they will
treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they
obtain from their other members. Our parent and/or subsidiaries
will follow privacy practices no less protective of all members
than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed
by applicable law. It is possible that We and/or its subsidiaries,
or any combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by
another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you
should expect that we would share some or all of your information
in order to continue to provide the service. You will receive
notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) and we will require
that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in
this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

Legal Requests. we cooperates with law enforcement inquiries,
as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual
property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize
us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement and
other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe
necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation
of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity
that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.<br><br>

<b>5. Your Use of other Members Information</b><br><br>

Our services also include access to instant messaging and chat
rooms. As a member you have access to the Member's ID No., and
you might gain access to other contact information of the Member(s)
through the regular use of the instant messaging and chat rooms.
By accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree that, with respect
to other Members' personally identifiable information that you
obtain through instant messaging communication, the chat rooms
and email, We hereby grants to you a license to use such information
only for: (a) Your Company related communications that are not
unsolicited commercial messages, and (b) any other purpose that
such member expressly agrees to after adequate disclosure of the
purpose(s). In all cases, you must give Members an opportunity
to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review
what information you have collected about them. In addition, under
no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose
personally identifiable information about another member to any
third party without our consent and the consent of such other
member after adequate disclosure. MEETING MILLIONAIRES and our members
do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing,
you are not licensed to add a MEETING MILLIONAIRES member to your mail
list (email or physical mail) without their express written consent
after adequate disclosure. To report spam from other MEETING MILLIONAIRES,
please Contact Us.<br><br>

<b>6. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Profile</b><br><br>

Following registration, you can review and change the information
you submitted during registration through the Member Service Menu
including: Your password and e-mail address. If you change your
password and email we keep track of your old password and email.
You can also change your registration information such as: name,
address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, profile,
likes and dislikes, desired date profile, essays and saves search
criteria.<br><br>

Upon your written request, we will suspend your membership,
contact information, and financial information from our active
databases. Such information will be suspended as soon as reasonably
possible in accordance with our suspension policy and applicable
law. To remove your profile so that others cannot view it, visit
the Remove Your Profile section of Member Services.<br><br>

We will retain in our files information you have requested
to remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes,
troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and conditions. Further,
such prior information is never completely removed from our databases
due to technical and legal constraints, including stored 'back
up' systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your
personally identifiable information will be completely removed
from our databases in response to your requests.<br><br>

<b>7. Control of Your Password</b><br><br>

You are responsible for all actions taken with your login information
and password, including fees. Therefore we do not recommend that
you disclose your MEETING MILLIONAIRES password or login information
to any third parties. If you choose to share this information
with third parties to provide you additional services, you are
responsible for all actions taken with your login information
and password and therefore should review each third party's privacy
policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial
control over your personally identifiable information and may
be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore,
if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should
immediately change your passwod<br><br>

<b>8. Other Information Collectors</b><br><br>

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy,
this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information
we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information
to other parties, whether they are on our Websites or on other
sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their
use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To
the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to
their own privacy policies. Since MEETING MILLIONAIRES does not control
the privacy policies of the third parties, you are subject to
ask questions before you disclose your personal information to
others.<br><br>

<b>9. Security</b><br><br>

MEETING MILLIONAIRES uses industry standard practices to safeguard
the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information,
including "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. MEETING MILLIONAIRES
treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques
to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside
and outside the company. However, "perfect security"
does not exist on the Internet.<br><br>

<b>10. Notice</b><br><br>

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time based on
your comments and our need to accurately reflect our data collection
and disclosure practices. All changes to this policy are effective
after we provide you with at least (30) days notice of changes
by sending email to members. We provide you with (30) days notice
to allow you the opportunity to notify MEETING MILLIONAIRES if you do
not agree to such changes.
