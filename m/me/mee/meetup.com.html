			<h1>Meetup Privacy Policy Statement</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="body">

			<p>Revision date: 7/26/2005</p>
		
			<p>Protecting your privacy is a serious matter and doing so is very 
			important to us. Please read this privacy policy statement (the "Policy") to learn more about our privacy policy. This Policy describes the information we collect from you and what may happen to that information, and only applies to such information. This Policy applies to all sites under the meetup.com domain.</p>

			<h3>Information Collection</h3>

			<p>We collect the following information about you and your use of our Website, platform and service (together, our "Platform") in order to create a better, more personalized experience for you:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li> for each topic group in which you participate, a nickname selected
				  by you or assigned by us, your email address, your name (if provided) a password selected
				  by you, your zip code; and</li>
				<li> for each topic group in which you participate, you may choose to
				  create and store a short description or statement which will be
				  viewed by anyone who is accessing that topic group, and your message board postings.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>In addition, we automatically track certain basic information about our users (such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, click patterns, etc.). We use this information to do internal research on our users' usage patterns, demographics, interests and general behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. We do not directly link these types of information with your personally identifiable information. For purposes of this Policy, "personally identifiable information" means any information that could be used to identify your personally (e.g., your email address).</p>

			<p>We currently contract with online partners to help manage and optimize our business and communications.  We use the services of a site analytics partner to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site.  To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by our site analytics partner on this site.  A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on your computer that is tied to information about you.  The type of information collected includes the URL you came from and go to, your browser information, and IP address, and helps us learn how to improve our service.  No information shared with our site analytics partner is directly linked to your personally identifiable information.  If you wish to opt-out of these website analysis tools, <a href="http://sitecatalyst.omniture.com/privacy/optout.html" class="popExit">you may do so here</a>.</p>

			<p>For our users convenience, we also use "cookies" to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session and to provide for an easier registration process. We do not use cookies for any purpose not described in this Policy. If you configure your browser or otherwise choose to reject the cookies, you may still use our site. However, to best experience our website and platform and most easily use our Platform you must have cookies enabled.</p>

			<p>Also, if you post messages in message areas (including the personal introduction section of each topic group) on our website, send us personal correspondence, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our website, we may collect such information and include it in your profile. Your profile is not accessible to other users or third parties other than Meetup personnel.</p>


			<h3>Use of Information</h3>

			<p>We use the information we collect about you (including your personally identifiable information) to create a better, more personalized experience for you based on your individual usage habits, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our site's content, layout and Services. These uses improve our site and allow us to better customize it to meet your needs. We also use the information we collect about you to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our Terms of Service Agreement.</p>

			<p>We may compile the information we collect about you and use it, <strong>in an aggregate form only</strong>, in the negotiation and establishment of service agreements with public and/or private enterprises under which such enterprises will serve as Meetup partners or as venues for meetings between our users ("Meetups").</p>

			<p>We may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as topic group newsletters or Meetup announcements (which also may include promotional communications), administrative notices, product or service offerings, and other communications relevant to your use of our Platform.</p>

			<p>We may use for promotional, sales or any use that we consider appropriate your correspondence with us or photographs submitted for publication on our website, be it via email, postings on our website, or feedback via the user polls. We will not link any of this correspondence or photographs to your personally identifiable information.</p>

WITHOUT YOUR AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT (ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS), WE DO NOT SELL, RENT OR OTHERWISE SHARE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH OTHER THIRD PARTIES, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER "REQUIRED DISCLOSURES". INSTEAD, TO THE EXTENT WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH OUR PARTNERS AND ADVERTISERS, WE SHARE ONLY AGGREGATED INFORMATION THAT IS NOT LINKED TO YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. Aggregated information that we may share with our marketing partners includes, but is not limited to, information showing the relative popularity of one Meetup venue over another (for example, the number of individuals present at a Meetup).</p>

			<p>You should understand that information you provide through the registration process or use of our Platform (including your name (if provided) and location information) may be accessible by and made public through syndication programs and by search engines, metasearch tools, crawlers, metacrawlers and other similar programs.</p>

			<p>Required disclosures. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose your personal information when required by law or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website, (b) enforce this Policy or the Terms of Service Agreement, (c) respond to claims that your Personal Information violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Meetup, its users and the public.
