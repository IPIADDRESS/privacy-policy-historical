                	<p>ValueClick Brands Site is not directed towards individual Internet consumers nor does it seek any personally identifiable information ("PII") from such consumers for marketing purposes.

                	<p><strong>II. INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
                	<p>ValueClick Brands may share information with its affiliated entities for or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any of the ValueClick Brands companies and/or sites. ValueClick Brands also may release information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ValueClick Brands or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>
