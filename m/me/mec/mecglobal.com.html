This includes physical, electronic, and management activities to protect information integrity, access, and use.</p><p><strong>Linking to other websites/Third party sites:&nbsp;</strong><br> A link from our Website to another website does not imply our endorsement of affiliates or websites, and we do not control third party websites to which we link, nor assume responsibility for their content or privacy policies. Once you follow a link to another website, the Wavemaker Privacy Notice no longer applies. It’s important to always read the privacy policy of any website you are visiting.</p><p><strong>Transfer of data upon change of control:&nbsp;</strong><br> In the event that another company acquires us, or all or substantially all of the assets of our business, through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all information (including any information you may have provided through the “contact us” page) that is in our possession or under our control to the acquiring party, and that information may be used by the acquiring party in its business.</p><p><strong>Data Subject Rights of individuals in the EEA and Switzerland:</strong> <br> You have the right to access, update, change, delete, restrict the use of, or obtain a copy of your personal data in an easily readable format.
