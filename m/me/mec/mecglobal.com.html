                [ Mediaedge:CIA, LLC ] ("[MEC]") is a part of GroupM
Worldwide, Inc., and has adopted these privacy principles
for the website located at ([mecglobal.com]). This Privacy
Policy applies only to the website on which it appears, and
not to any other [MEC], GroupM or other website or service.
This Privacy Policy also provides information about
activities we undertake across internet websites on behalf
of MEC clients.



[MEC] is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of
Internet users and fostering user confidence in the
Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing.
Accordingly, we are committed to observing applicable
industry guidelines including those established jointly by
the Interactive Advertising Bureau, American Association of
Advertising Agencies and Direct Marketing Association. We
continually evaluate innovative ways to protect online user
privacy while also seeking to deliver relevant advertising
and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients.
[MEC] provides services for its clients such as media
planning and buying, marketing communications planning,
campaign analytics and research, paid search placement and
search engine optimization, branded entertainment as well as
sports sponsorships ("Services").



The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide clear
notice about the user information we may collect online in
connection with our Services and on our own website.



The next few sections below describe how we collect user
information in connection with the operation of our Services
for our clients, such as through advertisements that may
appear on various websites on the Internet. Therefore,
certain information collection by [MEC] through the use of
cookies used in the Services, as described below, may occur
on numerous websites across the Internet.



For information on how we collect and use information that
is collected directly on this website (as opposed to through
the Services), please see the section entitled "Your
Correspondence on this Website".



Information We Collect Through our Services

We do not collect personally identifiable information
("PII") from users online through advertisements we manage
on behalf of our clients unless users affirmatively and
deliberately choose to release that information by
submitting it, in a text field for example. PII generally
refers to identifying information such as an individual's
name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.



Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services

We do collect non-personally identifiable information
("Non-PII) to identify computers that we have interacted
with before. For instance, by using Non-PII, we may be able
to identify a computer that has previously seen an
advertisement we launched on behalf of a client. In the
context of Non-PII, whenever we refer to ‘you' or
‘yours,' please remember that we may be referring to a
computer and not an identifiable person since we generally
do not know who is using a computer at any particular time.



Through the collection and use of Non-PII, we offer a range
of Services to allow advertisers to show you the most useful
and relevant online advertisements across numerous websites
and to prevent excessive or repeated deliveries of the same
advertisements. For example, if we think that a user is
interested in apparel options, then our Services may help
our clients deliver interest-based online advertisements to
you about a particular type of apparel. You can learn more
about such advertising practices by visiting
www.iab.net/privacymatters.



We may collect Non-PII regarding your web browsing, usage or
interactions with advertisements we manage on behalf of our
clients. We do this to better customize the sort of
advertisements you see on various websites and for other
purposes such as research and analysis. Non-PII may include
information such as the type of Internet browser used by an
online user, the type of computer operating system used, the
computer's Internet protocol ("IP") address, the domain name
of the websites visited before and after viewing an
advertisement, as well as information related to websites
and web pages a user is viewing when an advertisement is
shown.



We collect Non-PII through the use of cookies, pixels and
related technologies. A cookie is a file on your browser
that uniquely identifies your browser and computer. A pixel
is a line of code which is used by a website or third party
t to assign online activities to a computer or browser. The
use of a pixel allows websites and us to record, for
example, that a user has visited a particular web page.
Additional Non-PII from an earlier period or interaction may
be included in the pixel. Though Non-PII does not personally
identify anyone, we are still committed to giving users the
opportunity to exercise choice about the Non-PII we collect.
See Section titled: User Choice - Opting Out of Receiving
Cookies



Europe

Please note - in some countries an IP address is considered
PII by applicable law. If we conduct business in such
countries and we know that you are located in such a
country, we will treat your IP address as PII.



In such countries we interpose a "black box" which is
operated by an independent third party and which separates
the user's IP address from other data we collect. If your
browser does not accept cookies or if the opt-out-cookie is
set, no tracking takes place.



targ.ad 2.0 is a service of ours which places a cookie on
your computer for the purpose of interest-based marketing as
described above. This service is primarily used Europe. The
service has been certified with the Data Privacy Seal issued
by the Independent Data Protection Authority of the Federal
State Schleswig-Holstein in Germany in March 2010. You may
opt-out of the targ.ad 2.0 cookie by following the
instructions in the Section titled: User Choice - Opting Out
of Receiving Cookies.



Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

We do not collect PII via our client's advertisements, and
therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share PII collected on
our or other websites to non-affiliated third parties. If
you affirmatively and deliberately provide PII via one of
our client's advertisements who was identified to you at the
time of collection, then that PII will be provided to such
client, and such PII shall be subject to that client's
privacy policy.



We may disclose Non-PII collected through our Services, and
information derived from it, to our clients and vendors.
This Non-PII may be used by our clients to deliver tailored
ads to users on participating websites and for other
purposes as described above. This information does not
include any PII that can be used to contact or identify any
person individually. Further, we encourage our clients, as
applicable, to use any Non-PII they receive in compliance
with applicable laws and regulations and to publish privacy
policies that tell you about how the information they are
gathering is being used. We urge you to always read the
privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand
issues relating to your online privacy.



We may disclose a user's Non-PII to third parties when we
reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in
order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but
not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential
threats to the physical safety of any person. In addition
and if permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose and
provide access to a user's PII and Non-PII to our vendors
and contractors who are performing services on our behalf.
However, such vendors and contractors are not permitted to
use such user information for any purpose other than
providing services to us.



User Choice - Opting Out of Receiving Cookies

We use technology, which includes cookies, in the delivery
of our Services. We believe that the use of these tools
enables us and our advertiser clients to provide users with
a more meaningful web experience.



At all times, you may adjust your computer's web browser
settings to refuse all cookies. However, by doing so, you
may not be able to use certain features on the websites you
visit or take full advantage of all the website offerings
and interest-based advertising. You can remove cookies by
following directions provided in your Internet browser's
"help" file.



You may also choose to opt out of us (MEC) collecting
Non-PII in connection with the advertisements we manage on
behalf of our clients. Of course, doing this means that you
would no longer receive customized advertisements delivered
through our MEC proprietary technology. To opt-out of our
Non-PII collection, click here:



Cookie Opt-out[javascript: openwindow()]



Despite opting-out of our customized advertisements by
following the process above, you may still receive tailored
advertisements as a result of Non-PII collected (using
cookies) by other parties not affiliated with, or controlled
by us. To opt-out of non-PII collection for tailored online
advertising from numerous other providers, you can visit the
website of the Network Advertising Initiative to learn more
and to make choices accordingly.



Our opt-out cookies are programmed to expire 10 years after
they are initially issued. However, if you buy a new
computer, upgrade or change web browsers or take any action
which results in the deletion of this "opt out" cookie, you
will need to perform this opt-out process again. In order
for the opt-out to work, your browser must be set to accept
third party cookies.



Data Retention

We may use our anonymous cookie information for advertising
purposes for up to 13 months. Aggregate reports generated
from this information may be kept longer.



Information Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect
against the unauthorized access to, retention of, and
disclosure of information. This includes undertaking
necessary physical, electronic, and management activities
required to protect information integrity, access, and use.
Any information that is stored on our server is treated as
confidential information. Please keep in mind, however, that
despite these reasonable efforts to protect information on
our servers, no method of transmission over the Internet is
guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, while we strive to
protect your information at all times, we cannot guarantee
its absolute security.



Change to this Privacy Policy

Please note that because of the changing nature of privacy
laws, user needs, and our business, we may modify this
Privacy Policy from time to time by providing advance notice
on our website before implementing such modifications.
Accordingly, since we want to help you clearly understand
our Privacy Policy, and any pertinent revisions, we
encourage you to review our Privacy Policy periodically to
become aware of any changes that may have occurred.



Information We Collect Through Your Correspondence on this
Website

If you provide us information through our "contact us" link
on this website, sign up to receive our marketing emails or
newsletters, submit information in connection with an
employment inquiry, expressly enter information into a text
field or otherwise submit information to us, we will keep a
record of the information you provide including your email
address and any other PII you provide solely for the purpose
of responding to your inquiry or to provide you with
requested marketing materials or newsletters. Except as set
forth in this Privacy Policy, this information will never be
shared with third parties without your consent. [MEC] may
pass your PII to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies
so that they may contact you in connection with the
objective of your inquiry. Where we pass your PII to our
subsidiary or affiliated companies in another country, we
will make sure that they apply the same level of protection
to your information as we do. We may also disclose your
information to third parties in the event of suspected
fraud, legal requirement or in connection with our vendors
and contractors, all as described above.



MEC may use cookies to tailor your experience on our website
(this website) and to help provide a better service to you.
You may opt out of cookies used on our websites through the
instructions provided above.



If you would like us to remove your information from our
marketing e-mails or newsletters, please contact us at
privacy@mecglobal.com[mailto:privacy@mecglobal.com]. Be sure
to include your name, username and clear instructions
regarding any change to your PII including email address or
if you would like us to unsubscribe you from our database.



Children's Privacy

We are sensitive to the issue of children's privacy.
Therefore, our website and Services are neither developed
for, nor directed at, children. If you believe your child
has provided us with PII, and you would like to have the
information removed, please contact us at
privacy@mecglobal.com[mailto:privacy@mecglobal.com].



Linking to Other Websites

A link from our own website to another website does not
imply our endorsement of that website. We do not control the
websites to which we link and assume no responsibility for
their content or privacy policies. Therefore, you should
carefully review the privacy policies that apply to any
websites you access from our website.



Transfer of Data upon Change of Control

In the event that another company acquires all or
substantially all of the assets of our business through a
consolidation, merger, asset purchase, or other transaction,
we reserve the right to transfer all information (including
any PII a user may have provided through the "contact us"
page) that is in our possession or under our control to such
acquiring party.



Data Storage - United States, United Kingdom &amp; Germany

Our website and databases are maintained in the United
States of America, the United Kingdom and Germany. By using
the website or our Services, you freely and specifically
give us your consent to collect and store, your information
in the United States and Germany and to use your information
as specified within this Privacy Policy.

We do not collect PII via our client's advertisements, and
therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share PII collected on
our or other websites to non-affiliated third parties. If
you affirmatively and deliberately provide PII via one of
our client's advertisements who was identified to you at the
time of collection, then that PII will be provided to such
client, and such PII shall be subject to that client's
privacy policy.



We may disclose Non-PII collected through our Services, and
information derived from it, to our clients and vendors.
This Non-PII may be used by our clients to deliver tailored
ads to users on participating websites and for other
purposes as described above. This information does not
include any PII that can be used to contact or identify any
person individually. Further, we encourage our clients, as
applicable, to use any Non-PII they receive in compliance
with applicable laws and regulations and to publish privacy
policies that tell you about how the information they are
gathering is being used. We urge you to always read the
privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand
issues relating to your online privacy.



We may disclose a user's Non-PII to third parties when we
reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in
order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but
not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential
threats to the physical safety of any person. In addition
and if permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose and
provide access to a user's PII and Non-PII to our vendors
and contractors who are performing services on our behalf.
However, such vendors and contractors are not permitted to
use such user information for any purpose other than
providing services to us.



User Choice - Opting Out of Receiving Cookies

We use technology, which includes cookies, in the delivery
of our Services. We believe that the use of these tools
enables us and our advertiser clients to provide users with
a more meaningful web experience.



At all times, you may adjust your computer's web browser
settings to refuse all cookies. However, by doing so, you
may not be able to use certain features on the websites you
visit or take full advantage of all the website offerings
and interest-based advertising. You can remove cookies by
following directions provided in your Internet browser's
"help" file.



You may also choose to opt out of us (MEC) collecting
Non-PII in connection with the advertisements we manage on
behalf of our clients. Of course, doing this means that you
would no longer receive customized advertisements delivered
through our MEC proprietary technology. To opt-out of our
Non-PII collection, click here:



Cookie Opt-out[javascript: openwindow()]



Despite opting-out of our customized advertisements by
following the process above, you may still receive tailored
advertisements as a result of Non-PII collected (using
cookies) by other parties not affiliated with, or controlled
by us. To opt-out of non-PII collection for tailored online
advertising from numerous other providers, you can visit the
website of the Network Advertising Initiative to learn more
and to make choices accordingly.



Our opt-out cookies are programmed to expire 10 years after
they are initially issued. However, if you buy a new
computer, upgrade or change web browsers or take any action
which results in the deletion of this "opt out" cookie, you
will need to perform this opt-out process again. In order
for the opt-out to work, your browser must be set to accept
third party cookies.



Data Retention

We may use our anonymous cookie information for advertising
purposes for up to 13 months. Aggregate reports generated
from this information may be kept longer.



Information Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect
against the unauthorized access to, retention of, and
disclosure of information. This includes undertaking
necessary physical, electronic, and management activities
required to protect information integrity, access, and use.
Any information that is stored on our server is treated as
confidential information. Please keep in mind, however, that
despite these reasonable efforts to protect information on
our servers, no method of transmission over the Internet is
guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, while we strive to
protect your information at all times, we cannot guarantee
its absolute security.



Change to this Privacy Policy

Please note that because of the changing nature of privacy
laws, user needs, and our business, we may modify this
Privacy Policy from time to time by providing advance notice
on our website before implementing such modifications.
Accordingly, since we want to help you clearly understand
our Privacy Policy, and any pertinent revisions, we
encourage you to review our Privacy Policy periodically to
become aware of any changes that may have occurred.

forth in this Privacy Policy, this information will never be
shared with third parties without your consent. [MEC] may
pass your PII to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies
so that they may contact you in connection with the
objective of your inquiry. Where we pass your PII to our
subsidiary or affiliated companies in another country, we
will make sure that they apply the same level of protection
to your information as we do. We may also disclose your

fraud, legal requirement or in connection with our vendors
and contractors, all as described above.

Children's Privacy

We are sensitive to the issue of children's privacy.
Therefore, our website and Services are neither developed
for, nor directed at, children. If you believe your child
has provided us with PII, and you would like to have the
information removed, please contact us at
privacy@mecglobal.com[mailto:privacy@mecglobal.com].



Linking to Other Websites

A link from our own website to another website does not
imply our endorsement of that website. We do not control the
websites to which we link and assume no responsibility for
their content or privacy policies. Therefore, you should
carefully review the privacy policies that apply to any
websites you access from our website.



Transfer of Data upon Change of Control

In the event that another company acquires all or
substantially all of the assets of our business through a
consolidation, merger, asset purchase, or other transaction,
we reserve the right to transfer all information (including
any PII a user may have provided through the "contact us"
page) that is in our possession or under our control to such
acquiring party.
