    <p><a title="TRUSTe" href="http://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Medallia,-Inc-/validation?rid=97940707-77d5-495c-94ba-4b8bf361f4ee"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-11407" style="border: none;" alt="clicksealbox" src="http://privacy-policy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Medallia,-Inc-/seal?rid=97940707-77d5-495c-94ba-4b8bf361f4ee" width="142" height="45"></a></p>
<p>Medallia, Inc. is committed to safeguarding the privacy of your personally identifiable information (“PII”). This statement sets forth Medallia’s privacy policy. The policy complies with the privacy principles of TRUSTe, in which Medallia is a member.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this policy, Medallia defines the term “client” as a business with which Medallia has an established relationship, “customer” as a customer of a Medallia client, and “respondent” as an individual who takes Medallia’s surveys independent of Medallia’s clients.</p>
<p>This privacy policy covers how Medallia handles personally identifiable information, including personally identifiable information associated with the URLs Medallia.com and guest-survey.net.</p>
<h3>Safe Harbor Framework</h3>
<p>Medallia complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Medallia has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. &nbsp;Medallia’s designated provider for alternative dispute resolution under the Safe Harbor is TRUSTe.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Medallia’s certification, please visit <a title="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>. &nbsp;To contact Medallia regarding this privacy policy or the Safe Harbor program, you may reach Medallia using the contact information provided at the bottom of this policy.</p>
<h3>Information Medallia Collects</h3>
<p>Medallia collects survey and other market research data about individuals’ usage of products and services. The data is used by Medallia clients to improve their products and services.</p>
<p>Medallia does not receive, use or collect personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses, except under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>When an existing or prospective client goes to www.medallia.com to request a demonstration of a Medallia product, he or she must provide contact details including person-specific information (name, title, phone number and e-mail address) and organization-specific information (name and address). Medallia uses this information solely for the purpose of contacting the interested party and scheduling demonstrations. Medallia does not share any PII collected on its www.medallia.com website with outside parties.</p>
<p>When Medallia surveys customers on behalf of its clients, it receives customers’ personally identifiable information from its clients. Medallia enters into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with clients that legally obligate Medallia to protect the personally identifiable customer information it receives and use it only for the purposes specified in the contract. From time to time Medallia may collect personally identifiable information during a survey, if requested to do so by a client. This personally identifiable information will be shared with the client, and will be used as described in that survey.</p>
<p>Medallia may, with the written consent of its clients, ask questions of customers for whom it has received personally identifiable information, and bundle and sell those responses in an aggregate form. Before providing any survey results to third parties, responses are stripped of personally identifying or client-identifying information, aggregated, and adjusted using Medallia’s proprietary methodologies.</p>
<p>When Medallia surveys respondents on its own behalf, it typically does not collect or have any other access to personally identifying information. If Medallia does request personally identifiable information during a survey, it will use the personally identifiable information as described in that survey. When Medallia provides resulting proprietary research to third parties, it sometimes reveals individual responses, but these do not contain any personally identifying information.</p>
<p>Medallia does not collect or receive sensitive personally identifiable information such as: credit card numbers, social security numbers, financial account and transaction information, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. Medallia does collect demographic information for statistical purposes. Responses to demographic questions are entirely voluntary.<br>
Medallia’s mobile reporting application, used by Medallia’s clients, uses third-party services to gather data on application usage and stability. This data is shared only with the relevant client. A user may unsubscribe from tracking through the user settings screen within the mobile application.</p>
<p>Medallia uses cookies primarily to identify returning users from the same computer and insure the integrity of its research. As part of its basic uses of Internet technology to provide surveys, Medallia also collects technical information such as: respondent IP address; the date and time at which respondents access Medallia’s website and respondent HTTP request headers. Medallia also uses third-party analytical cookies for tracking web traffic and usage.&nbsp; The use of cookies by our affiliates is not covered by our privacy policy.&nbsp; We do not have access to these cookies.</p>
<p>Medallia uses Google Display Advertising and Remarketing cookies on the Medallia website (but not on the survey site or reporting application), which enable third-party vendors to show Medallia advertisements across the Internet.&nbsp;If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">Here</a>.</p>
<h3>Protection of Personally-identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Medallia is not in the business of selling or renting personally identifiable information gathered in the course of client work to third parties. Medallia shares information with third parties, such as its clients, only as described in this policy or as described at the time information is collected. For example, Medallia may, at the request of a client, ask you for your email address so a client can follow up with you about your responses to a survey. The provision of such information is typically voluntary, and at all times participation in a survey is, of course, voluntary.</p>
<h3>Voluntary Participation</h3>
<p>Individuals may choose not to participate in Medallia’s research and are under no obligation to take surveys sent to them. &nbsp;An opt-out choice is included in each communication to individuals, and those who exercise it will be added to Medallia’s opt-out list for the relevant client within ten (10) business days of unsubscribing. For each client, Medallia does not send survey invitations to any e-mail address on the applicable opt-out list. Medallia also provides its opt-out lists on a timely basis to its clients and third party agents so that they may properly update their records.</p>
<p>Individuals may also elect to opt out at any time from receiving email from Medallia regarding Medallia’s products and services. &nbsp;An opt-out choice will be added to Medallia’s opt-out list for communications about products and services within ten (10) business days of unsubscribing.</p>
<p>Individuals who wish to reverse an earlier unsubscribe option may contact Medallia’s Privacy Contact (see contact information below) to change their opt-out status.</p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>Customers and respondents may contact Medallia (see Privacy Contact below) at any time if they feel there is an error in their personally identifiable information. Because Medallia generally receives and retains personally identifiable information as an agent of its clients, it will usually refer individuals reporting inaccuracies in their personally identifying information to the originating source for correction.</p>
<p>Subsequent to verifying the identity of a person making a request, Medallia will respond to a request for offline access to personally identifiable information within 30 days of receiving the request.</p>
<h3><b>Data Retention</b></h3>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services. If you wish to request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at the contact information listed below, and we will coordinate with the Medallia client for which the data was collected. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<h3>Third-party Partners</h3>
<p>From time to time, Medallia may contract with third parties to perform functions necessary for its research operations and, under the terms of those contracts, may transfer data to those third parties. Medallia requires any such third party to maintain confidentiality of such data.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Medallia takes strict physical, technical and procedural measures to keep information secure by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Housing data in physically secure facilities that are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week</li>
<li>Protecting network from inappropriate access through continuous firewall protection, anti-virus protection, and identification, authentication and authorization procedures</li>
<li>Transmitting certain data securely through secure socket layers (SSLs)</li>
<li>Encrypting certain data</li>
<li>Destroying all media and documents containing personally-identifiable information before disposal</li>
<li>Strictly limiting personally-identifiable information to key personnel and requiring ALL employees and contractors to sign non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements</li>
<li>Using incident detection, response and escalation procedures</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>Medallia has received TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal.&nbsp; The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, http://www.medallia.com and does not cover information that may be collected through our mobile application.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe at&nbsp;<a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.</p>
<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p>When requested by legal authorities to disclose personally identifiable information, Medallia will inform the court of various factors justifying confidentiality and respondent anonymity. However, Medallia may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information where judicial or other governmental subpoenas, warrants, or orders are properly issued. Individuals’ unsubscribe option in no way limits Medallia’s use, disclosure or distribution of personally-identifiable information to the extent such use, disclosure or distribution is required by law, court order or other valid legal process. &nbsp;Medallia will communicate with the affected client as soon as possible, unless prohibited by law or court order.</p>
<p>If Medallia is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Medallia may transfer your data. &nbsp;In such a circumstance, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.</p>
