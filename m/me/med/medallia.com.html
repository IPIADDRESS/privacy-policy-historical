					  <p>Medallia, Inc. is committed to safeguarding the privacy of your personally identifiable information. This statement sets forth Medallia’s privacy policy. <span style="font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">The policy complies with the privacy principles of TRUSTe, in which Medallia is a member, as well as with the Safe Harbor Program, a framework established by U.S. and European parties for collecting, using, and retaining personally identifiable information from EU countries. </span></p>
					  <p>For the purposes of this policy, Medallia defines the term "client" as a business with which Medallia has an established relationship, “customer” as a customer of a Medallia client, and “respondent” as an individual who takes Medallia’s surveys independent of Medallia’s clients.</p>
                      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Information Medallia Collects</h3>
                      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Medallia collects survey and other market research data about individuals’ usage of products and services. The data is used by Medallia clients to improve their products and services. </p>
                      <p>Medallia does not receive, use or collect personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses, except under the following circumstances:</p>
                      <p>When Medallia surveys customers on behalf it its clients, it receives customers’ personally identifiable information from its clients. Medallia enters into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with clients that legally obligate Medaliia to protect the personally identifiable customer information it receives and use it only for the purposes specified in the contract. </p>
                      <p>Medallia may, with the written consent of its clients, ask questions of customers for whom it has received personally identifiable information, and bundle and sell those responses in an aggregate form. Before providing any survey results to third parties, responses are stripped of personally identifying or client-identifying information, aggregated, and adjusted using Medallia’s proprietary methodologies. </p>
                      <p>When Medallia surveys respondents on its own behalf, it does not collect or have any other access to personally identifying information. When Medallia provides resulting proprietary research to third parties, it sometimes reveals individual responses, but these do not contain any personally identifying information.</p>
                      <p>Medallia does not collect or receive sensitive personal information such as: credit card numbers, social security numbers, financial account and transaction information, medical or health information, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. Medallia does collect demographic information for statistical purposes. Responses to demographic questions are entirely voluntary.</p>
                      <p>Medallia uses cookies primarily to identify returning users from the same computer and insure the integrity of its research. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information users submit while on our site.&nbsp; As part of its basic uses of Internet technology to provide surveys, Medallia also collects technical information such as: respondent IP address; the date and time at which respondents access Medallia’s website and respondent HTTP request headers.</p>
                      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Voluntary Participation</h3>
                      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Individuals may choose not to participate in Medallia’s research. An opt-out choice is included in each communication to individuals, and those who exercise it will be added to Medallia’s opt-out list within ten (10) business days of unsubscribing. Medallia does not send survey invitations to any e-mail address on its opt-out list. Medallia also provides its opt-out list on a timely basis to its clients and third party agents so that they may properly update their records.</p>
                      <p>Individuals may elect to opt out at any time from receiving email from Medallia and are under no obligation to take surveys sent to them. Individuals who wish to reverse an earlier unsubscribe option may contact Medallia’s privacy contact (see contact information below) to change their opt-out status.</p>
                      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Transfer of Personally-Identifiable Information to Third Parties </h3>
                      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Medallia does not sell or rent personally identifiable information gathered in the course of client work to third parties. From time to time, Medallia may contract third parties to perform functions necessary for its research operations and, under the terms of those contracts, may transfer personally identifiable data to those third parties. Medallia requires such third party agents to enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements that obligate them to maintain the same level of data confidentiality as Medallia and to use the data in no manner other than that specified in the contract. </p>
                      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Access</h3>
                      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Customers and respondents may contact Medallia (see Privacy Contact below) at any time if they feel there is an error in their personal information. Because Medallia generally receives and retains personal information as an agent of its clients, it will usually refer individuals reporting inaccuracies in their personally identifying information to the originating source for correction. </p>
                      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Security</h3>
                      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Medallia takes strict physical, technical and procedural measures to keep information secure by:</p>
                      <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
                        <li>Housing data in physically secure facilities that are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week</li>
                        <li>Protecting network from inappropriate access through continuous firewall protection, anti-virus protection, and identification, authentication and authorization procedures</li>
                        <li>Transmitting certain data securely through secured socket layers (SSLs)</li>
                        <li>Encrypting certain data</li>
                        <li>Destroying all media and documents containing personally-identifiable information before disposal</li>
                        <li>Strictly limiting personally-identifiable information to key personnel and requiring ALL employees and contractors to sign non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements</li>
                        <li>Using incident detection, response and escalation procedures </li>
                      </ul>                      
                      <h1 class="style1" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Enforcement</h1>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">When requested by legal authorities to disclose personal information, Medallia will inform the court of various factors justifying confidentiality and respondent anonymity. However, Medallia may be required by law to disclose personal information where judicial or other governmental subpoenas, warrants, or orders are properly issued. Individuals’ unsubscribe option in no way limits Medallia’s use, disclosure or distribution of personally-identifiable information to the extent such use, disclosure or distribution is required by law, court order or other valid legal process. </p>
