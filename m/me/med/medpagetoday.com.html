</ul>
<p>We may also supplement the Personal Information and Other Information we collect from you with information from third parties, including third party affiliate network operators, referral sources, governmental agencies, social networking sites or services (such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn), and commercially available or public sources (such as data brokers, data aggregators and public databases). If you use a third party connection or sign in service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google+) to create a membership or profile on any part of the Services, access our content or forward our content to another person, platform or service, we may also receive your user name, password and/or email address for those third party services or other information available about you or collected from you on those services. Such services may give you the option to post information about your activities on the Services to your profile page to share with others within your network. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of third parties, including those that may disclose information to us.</p>
<p><strong> All of the above information is referred to collectively as “<em>User Information</em>”. </strong></p>
<p>Please note that we are not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the discussions in certain public areas of the site, such as forums, blogs, wikis, chat rooms, private messages, message boards or other publicly accessible interaction, or information that you choose to make public in your member profile or other areas that allow users to upload or post content. We discourage users from posting Personal Information in this fashion, and any Personal Information you post to these areas is not covered by this Privacy Policy. You can change your publicly available information at any time via your profile page or to request removal of your Personal Information from these areas. Please see our section on <a href="#section5">How you can change or control what is collected </a> in this Privacy Policy. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p id="section2"><strong>2. How we collect and use information.</strong></p>
<p>MedPage Today collects information as described herein. All information is or may be used as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that the Services include advertisements, promotions and sponsored areas that are sold directly by Everyday Health Media, LLC (“<strong><em>EHM</em></strong> ”), a sister company of MedPage Today, LLC. EHM may also use the information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We collect User Information across our Services, such as when you register for site membership or create a profile or account on any part of the Services; purchase a subscription or product; sign up for emails, newsletters, bulletins, webinars or white papers; enter a sweepstakes, contest, competition or prize draw; participate in surveys; perform search queries on the Services; or otherwise communicate with us. We also collect User Information about you offline through telephone or direct mail efforts or from customers, vendors, suppliers, third parties and publicly-available sources.</p>
<p>When you use the Services, we may combine Personal Information with Other Information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you and to improve the functionality of the Services and our ability to market or advertise to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. We may also combine information you have provided to us with information obtained from other sources.</p>
<p>Personal Information may be used to provide Services to you, including when we send emails or newsletters offering services or products to you. Personal Information may also be used in some cases to send you advertisements and promotions on the Services and on third party channels. Personal Information you provide to us is used in a way that is compatible with the Services and this Privacy Policy. Some of the Services use Personal Information of a registered user to “pre-populate” online forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting additional information about you by the Services or on behalf of a third party.</p>
<p>We collect Verification Details in order to offer you services such as Continuing Medical Education (“<strong><em>CME</em></strong>”) credits and allow you to use and participate in some parts of the Services that are open only to eligible healthcare professionals. We deploy a variety of processes to verify the identity of members who have self-identified as a healthcare professional. Using information supplied to us by you as well as a variety of data we license, we utilize the Verification Details to confirm users’ identity and/or license status. We reserve the right to ask for proof of your certification as a healthcare professional. If our verification process reveals that you are not a fully licensed healthcare professional, your request to participate or continue participation in our programs and Services may be denied. While we take steps to verify members we make no guarantee or representation as to the identity or licensed status of any member or user.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to send an article to a contact or to invite a contact to become a member of a website, we may ask you for your contact’s email address or allow you to import your contacts from your email account’s address book. We may automatically send your contact a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website. We may collect the username and password for the email account from which you wish to import your contacts, and will only use that information for that purpose.</p>
<p>We and our partners use cookies and other tracking technologies to analyze trends, administer Services, track users’ movements around the Services and on third party sites, devices and applications, and to gather demographic information about our user base. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on the Services. To manage Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"> here</a>.</p>
<p>Tracking technologies on the Services may be deployed by us and/or by our service providers or partners. Certain tracking technologies enable us to assign a unique identifier to you, and relate information about your use of the Services to other information about you, including your User Information. We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times and use such information along with offline and online information obtained from other sources (including from third parties), including, but not limited to, demographic information and updated contact information for the purposes of learning more about you so we can provide you with relevant content and advertising.</p>
<p>When you receive email messages or newsletters from us, we may use web beacons, customized links, clear GIFs or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information, and/or aggregate with other data we collect for some or all of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We and our partners (including e-commerce partners, affiliates, and analytics providers) may also use technologies such as pixel tags, e-tags, IP addresses, Local Shared Objects, Local Storage, Flash cookies and HTML5 to analyze trends; administer the Services; collect and store information such as user settings, anonymous browser identifiers and video viewing history; supplement our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement; track users’ location and movements around the Services; gather demographic information about our user base; and to improve our understanding of traffic on the Services, visitor behavior, and responses to promotional campaigns. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these third party companies on an individual and aggregated basis. For example, we may connect information about your IP address to known corporate or other information or User Information and use the associated information related to aggregate content preferences to assist in our efforts to market services to you or the originating corporation(s). Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing Local Storage. To manage Flash Local Shared Objects please click <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>We use mobile analytics software to collect data and to better understand the functionality of our mobile software, devices and applications on your phone and other devices. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We may link this information to User Information. <br><br></p>
<p>The Services include certain social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, which include the “Share” button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Services. These features may collect your IP address, track which page you are visiting on the Services, and may serve a cookie to enable the features to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Services. <strong>Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. </strong></p>
<p id="section3"><strong>3. Information regarding interest-based advertising.</strong></p>
<p>EHM and/or certain third parties collect information about you for online behavioral advertising (“<strong><em>OBA</em></strong>”) purposes in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising on the Services and on other websites, platforms and media channels. OBA is also referred to as interest-based advertising<em>.</em></p>
<p>EHM displays ads on both the Services and on third party websites, applications, platforms and other media channels (collectively, “<strong><em>Channels</em></strong>”). We use Online Data as well as other User Information to send you OBA. For example, if you read an article about a particular subject on the Services, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels.</p>
<p><strong> The specific providers we use for OBA are subject to change. </strong> For a list of some of the applicable providers, <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?type=ziffdavispop&amp;pid=ziffdavis01&amp;aid=ziffdavis01"> click here</a>. For information about how to opt out of tracking methods for these entities and others, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">click here</a>. For more details about OBA and opting out, <a href="#oba">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Online Data is aggregated with the other information and data we collect as described in this Privacy Policy and/or similar data collected by partners to create groups of users and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data, and a general geographic location, which may be derived from your IP address or mobile device, (b) the pages you view and links you click when viewing an email or using the Services and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you enter when using certain search services. We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests. We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your Personal Information.</p>
<p>We may also sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information. Some of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.</p>
<p>We engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. We do not authorize such third party providers to collect Personal Information from our Services for their own purposes. Except as may be set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, this Online Data is retained by us for not more than 180 days after which it shall expire. However, the 180 day period may commence again if the same user subsequently visits or interacts with an ad, email, the Services or a Channel.</p>
<p>We may also engage third parties for the purpose of recognizing our users and delivering interest-based content and advertisements to them. We may share your User Information with our partners such as your name, postal address, email, or other identifier. Our partners may also: (i) collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, advertising ID, and information about your browser or operating system; (ii) combine User Information about you received from us with information about you from other sites or services; and (iii) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p>
<p>Our ad network partners may use cookies, web beacons and advertising IDs to collect information about your activities on the Services and Channels to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you click or tap on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria. If you do not want to have this information used by us or vendors collecting OBA data on the Services for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"><strong>here</strong></a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served all advertising. If you opt out of interest-based ads, you will continue to receive ads, but these ads may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser, reset your advertising ID, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out settings.</p>
<p id="section4"><strong>4. What information we give to third parties.</strong></p>
<p>We provide User Information to third party companies and contractors who work on our behalf to provide us with specialized services, such as email message deployment, email address validation, merge-purge (identifying and removing duplicate addresses), subscription fulfillment, customer support and service, research, statistical analysis, cross-device user tracking, data and website hosting, marketing, advertising, and other data and transaction processing. These companies work on our behalf, are authorized by us to obtain only the information they need to deliver the service, and are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information. We also engage third party service providers for the purpose of processing the subscription orders, to fulfill your orders for product purchases, to honor your request to be removed from promotional mailings, or other services. These service providers have access to or are provided with certain Personal Information (including credit card information) in order to provide us with the applicable service.</p>
<p>Personal Information of participants in CME programs may be disclosed to accredited CME providers to ensure that participants receive proper CME credit. For questions regarding CME, please contact Projects in Knowledge, Inc. via email at <a href="mailto:cme@projectsinknowledge.com"> cme@projectsinknowledge.com </a> or by mail at:</p>
<p>Projects In Knowledge, Inc.<br> 290 W. Mt. Pleasant Avenue, Suite 2350 <br> Livingston, NJ 07039</p>
<p>We may provide your Personal Information (including name, specialty, NPI number, and country of residence) and Other Information, including information about your engagement with the Services (e.g., whether you viewed, interacted with or requested information about promotional content), to advertisers and/or such advertisers’ third party analytics providers and agents as well as to potential advertisers and their agents. We are not responsible for how these third parties use your information.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“<strong><em>FDA</em></strong>”) requires product manufacturers to report adverse events relating to their products as they become aware of those events. Your participation in any of our programs may result in you providing a response or other information that could indicate that an adverse event relating to such a product may have occurred. As a consequence of your participation and response, we may be requested to provide your contact information to the manufacturer so that the manufacturer may investigate and where applicable file the appropriate report with the FDA. By your participation in any of our programs and where you have indicated an adverse event may have occurred, you agree that we may release your contact information to the product manufacturer. At times, we conduct contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, or produce and host sponsored white papers, webcasts or other downloads for a variety of companies (“<strong><em>Sponsors</em></strong>”). Information collected during the registration for such events is used by us as part of User Information, and may be shared with the Sponsor and others. The information collected would be subject to our Privacy Policy and, in the event that it is shared with a Sponsor or other third party, would also be subject to the Sponsor’s or such other third party’s privacy policy, and it may be used by us, the Sponsor, and/or such other third parties for follow up purposes. We may also share your information with third party vendors involved in the administration of such events. For contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, please read the official rules or terms and conditions carefully before you submit your information.</p>
<p>When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with our partner), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that partner. This may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the Services. Use of your information by such partners may be subject to their privacy policies as well as ours.</p>
<p>In order to help us sell advertising on the Services and otherwise publicize us and our brands, we may share aggregate statistics that describe our online audience. Those statistics are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse the Services and describe, among other things, the demographics of our visitors.</p>
<p>We may also disclose User Information that we receive from you and from third party and public sources to third parties whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., third party providers of goods and services, marketing and advertising companies and agencies, content publishers and retailers) that want to market products or services to you. In addition, we provide information to third parties for OBA as discussed <a href="#section3">above</a>.</p>
<p>We and some of our advertisers use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements and perform related services when you visit the Services. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookie and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services. We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.</p>

If it is discovered that we have collected Personal Information from someone under 13, we will delete that information immediately.</p>
<p><em>Data Retention</em> . The time period for which we keep information varies according to the information’s use. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period.
