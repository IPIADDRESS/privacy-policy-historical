      <p><strong>Last Modified </strong> <br>
        This Policy was last modified on January 1, 2008. 
      </p>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Introduction </strong> <br>
          A key player in the animation industry in  Singapore, MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD is an <strong>animation production company</strong> that focuses  on working closely with producers, distributors, broadcasters and partners  worldwide to produce original television content and high-end animation for  broadcast and marketing purposes. <br>
          <br>
          MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD is committed to  respecting your privacy, and we have created this privacy policy (the “Privacy  Policy”) to give you a clear understanding of how our Web Site operates, and  how personally identifiable information is handled.&nbsp; <br>
          We have a clear Privacy Policy: we collect no  personally identifiable information through this web site unless you  voluntarily supply it.&nbsp; We define  personally identifiable information as information that can uniquely identify  an individual person. <br>
          This privacy statement explains under what  circumstances we gather personal information, how we use it, your choices in  regard to our use of the information and how we protect the information. <br>
          By using our Web Site, you consent to the collection  and use of information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. <br>
          Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to  online activities. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Type of Information Collected </strong></p>
        <p>When you  visit our Web Site, we may collect and store information from you that you  voluntarily choose to give us or enter on our Web Site, including personally  identifiable information.&nbsp; In these  instances, we will obtain your consent.&nbsp;  Our primary purposes in collecting and processing your personally  identifiable information are to provide you with the services you request or to  personalize product information and offers for you.&nbsp; If you request us to do so, we will use your  information to provide you with additional information about our products and  services and to send you information on other products and services that may be  of interest to you. If so, we will state this in the area of our Web Site where  we collect information for these purposes. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Our Use of the Information </strong></p>
        <p>If you need to provide personal information to access  features or services, we will clearly disclose how the information will be  used. <br>
          We do not  sell, trade, or rent your personally identifiable information to others.  However, we may share your personally identifiable information with other MEDIAFREAKS  PTE LTD businesses or affiliates, our agents, contractors or business partners  in order that they may perform services for us. For example, your personally  identifiable information may be shared (i) with contractors we use to support  our business (<em>e.g.</em> fulfillment services, technical support, delivery  services, and financial institutions), (ii) in connection with the sale,  assignment, or other transfer of the business of this site to which the  information relates, or (iii) where required by applicable laws, court orders,  or government regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>In addition, since we conduct research on user  demographics, interests, and behaviors based upon information provided to us  during use of our Web Sites, we may combine your information with information  collected from other individuals to produce anonymous, aggregated, and statistical  information. Aggregated and statistical data does not include personally  identifiable information. We use this information, such as the percentage of  male or female visitors, or the percentage of visitors within certain age  brackets, to improve the content of our site. We also may share this anonymous  aggregated or statistical information, which does not identify particular  individuals nor associate particular individuals with illnesses or conditions,  with partners or other third parties. <br>
          As our company changes and grows, we might sell or buy  companies, subsidiaries, products or assets. In such transactions, customer  information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event MEDIAFREAKS  PTE LTD goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by  another company, or sale of all or a portion of its products or assets, your  personal information will likely be transferred.&nbsp; We will make every effort to notify you via  e-mail, letter or public posting of any such change in the control of your  personal information. At the time of our notification, you will be given a  clear choice to allow the use of your personal information for secondary  purposes such as product information, research, promotions, discounts and other  legally valid business communications. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Notice </strong></p>
        <p>Where MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD collects personally  identifiable information directly from individuals, we inform them about the  purpose and use of the collected information, and the choices and means, if  any, we offer individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal  information. Notice is provided in clear and conspicuous language when  individuals are asked for the information.&nbsp;  MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD does not use or disclose the information for a  purpose other than that for which it was originally collected. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Consent </strong></p>
        <p>MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD believes that consent is one of  the most important privacy principles. You have the choice not to submit any  personally identifiable information to us (although under such circumstances  you would be unable to participate in all aspects of our Web Site). <br>
          On the  enrollment page where you register for e-mail distribution or other services,  an “opt-in” mechanism is provided, meaning that you will not receive  communications or services from us unless you click the box expressing your  explicit consent. For certain communications and services, we verify your  explicit consent prior to commencing the requested service.&nbsp; If later you choose to end the communications  or services from us you can do so by changing your previously indicated choice  in the relevant web site, or, in case of e-mail distributions, each e-mail  message we send you provides a link to unsubscribe from the e-mail list for that  particular service or distribution. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Access to Review, Correct, and Delete Information </strong> </p>
        <p>          MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD uses personally identifiable  information only in ways that are compatible with your consent and the purposes  for which it was collected.&nbsp; We take  reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its  intended use, accurate, complete, and current.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Security </strong> </p>
        <p>          We are committed to the security of personally  identifiable information and we take reasonable precautions to maintain that  protection. <br>
          MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD has implemented SSL technology to  protect the transmission of personally identifiable information. This  technology encrypts the information prior to transmission over the Internet  between your computer and our servers.&nbsp;  While MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD has implemented SSL technology for some  purposes, we cannot guarantee the privacy of all transmissions (including,  e-mail communications) to and from our Web Sites.&nbsp; We protect personally identifiable  information stored on the web site servers from unauthorized access using  reasonable technical and procedural controls. </p>
        <p>          Although MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD uses physical and  administrative procedures to attempt to safeguard personally identifiable  information, we cannot guarantee that it is completely secure from people who  might attempt to evade security measures or intercept transmissions over the  Internet. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Cross-border Data Transfer </strong> </p>
        <p>          The  collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information  discussed in this policy may involve a transfer of the information to  jurisdictions located outside your country of residence that may not have  equivalent laws and rules regarding privacy and data protection.&nbsp; In these cases, we will ask for your consent  to such transfers and disclosures in accordance with this policy. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Retention of Personally Identifiable Information </strong> </p>
        <p>          Once you  have provided personally identifiable information to MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD, we  store and maintain the information you have volunteered for so long as we need  it to provide the service that you requested, unless you have directed us  otherwise, or for so long as we are required by law.&nbsp; </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Cookies </strong> </p>
        <p>          Cookies are tokens of information that our web sites  may provide to your browser, which is used only by our web sites while you are  at those sites.&nbsp; The MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD  sites supply your web browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier  used to better understand web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what  areas of our site users prefer (<em>e.g.</em>, based on the number of visits to  those areas).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD will only be able to read those  cookies that we place; we cannot access or read other parties’ cookies.&nbsp; We may also use cookies on an aggregate basis  to track site navigation and traffic trends. This aggregated and anonymous  information will help us to improve Site content, and may be shared with  partners or other third parties.&nbsp; <br>
          If you are a registered user on the MEDIAFREAKS PTE  LTD web site, when you login, we may supply you with a cookie that is  maintained by your browser and contains your identifier.&nbsp; This type of cookie is used to identify you  and provide you with access to areas of our web site that are limited to  registered users, such as those that allow you to view and manage your account. </p>
        <p>          If you simply want to browse, you do not have to  accept cookies from our site.&nbsp; Should you  decide, however, that you would like to register and login to special areas of  the web site and you have modified your browser settings not to accept the  cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept cookies that we send  it. Otherwise, we will not be able to let you participate in certain areas of  the web site. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.&nbsp; To learn more about cookies and how to  specify your cookie preferences, please search for “cookie” in the “Help”  portion of your browser. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Web Beacons </strong> </p>
        <p>          In order to measure the effectiveness and/or traffic  on our sites, our sites may use “pixel tags” (also called clear GIFs, web  beacons, and web bugs) in conjunction with cookies.&nbsp; A pixel tag is a type of web page graphic  that often appears to be invisible because it is usually 1 by 1 pixel in size.  The tag is used to track the number of users that arrive at our sites and their  navigation through our sites. For instance, we may use a tag to statistically  count the number of people using our site or particular pages within our  site.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          We sometimes include pixel tags in our HTML-formatted  e-mail messages that we send (or that are sent on our behalf) in order to  determine which e-mail messages were opened and to note whether an e-mail  message was acted upon. You may render some pixel tags or web beacons unusable  by rejecting their associated cookies.&nbsp; <br>
          We do not  use the pixel tag technology to collect any personally identifiable  information.        </p>
        <p>          <strong>IP Addresses </strong> </p>
        <p>          An  Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to  your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) whenever you connect to  the Internet. Like other Internet sites, MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD may collect IP  addresses to analyze aggregate information about the number of visitors and  site usage. Your IP address is not linked with personal information that you  provide. MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD does reserve the right, however, to use IP  addresses to identify individuals who threaten our site, service, or customers  in accordance with regulatory requirements. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Other Features of Our Services </strong> </p>
        <p>          Our sites  may include various functionalities that are intended to serve you or help us  better understand your needs.&nbsp; For  example, from time to time, we may ask for personally identifiable information  when you complete a survey or enter a contest. In other circumstances we may  offer you other web-enabled services such as newsletters, product information,  and reminders.&nbsp; When presenting you with  such functionalities on our sites we will clearly describe the purpose for  collecting such information, as well as the intended uses of the information. </p>
        <p><strong>Leaving MEDIAFREAKS PTE LTD </strong> </p>
        <p>          As a resource to our visitors, we provide links to  other web sites. We try to carefully choose those sites that we believe are  useful and meet our high standards.
