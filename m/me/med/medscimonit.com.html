You may ask us whether or not we process any of your personal data and, if so, receive access to that data in the form of a copy. When complying with an access request, we will also provide you with additional information, such as the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned as well as any other information necessary for you to exercise the essence of this right.  </p><p>b) Right to rectification. You have the right to have your data rectified in case of inaccuracy or incompleteness. Upon request, we will correct inaccurate personal data about you and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, complete incomplete personal data, which may include the provision of a supplementary statement.  </p><p style="">c) Right to erasure. You also have the right to have your personal data erased, which means the deletion of your data by us and, where possible, any other controller to whom your data has previously been made public by us. Erasure of your personal data only finds place in certain cases, prescribed by law and listed under article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This includes situations where your personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the initial purposes for which they were processed as well as situations where they were processed unlawfully. Due to the way we maintain certain services, it may take some time before backup copies are erased.  </p><p>d) Right to restriction of processing. You have the right to obtain the restriction of the processing of your personal data, which means that we suspend the processing of your data for a certain period of time. Circumstances which may give rise to this right include situations where the accuracy of your personal data was contested but some time is needed for us to verify their (in)accuracy. This right does not prevent us from continuing to store your personal data. We will inform you before the restriction is lifted. </p><p>e) Right to data portability. Your right to data portability entails that you may request us to provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to have such data transmitted directly to another controller, where technically feasible. Upon request and where this is technically feasible we will transmit your personal data directly to the other controller.  </p><p>f) Right to object. You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data, which means you may request us to no longer process your personal data. This only applies in case the ‘legitimate interests’ ground (including profiling) constitutes the legal basis for processing (see ‘Legal basis’). At any time and free of charge you can object to direct marketing purposes in case your personal data are processed for such purposes, which includes profiling purposes to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. In case you exercise this right, we will no longer process your personal data for such purposes.  </p><p>g) You may withdraw your consent at any time. You may withdraw your consent at any time by following the specific instructions in relation to the processing for which you provided your consent. For example, you may withdraw consent, by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email, adjusting your communication preferences in your account.  </p><p>For more information on how you can withdraw your consent for cookies and similar technologies we use when you visit our websites or use our apps, please check the cookie policy on our website or in the app. There may be situations where we are entitled to deny or restrict your rights as described above. In any case, we will carefully assess whether such an exemption applies and inform you accordingly. We may, for example, deny your request for access when necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of other individuals or refuse to delete your personal data in case the processing of such data is necessary for compliance with legal obligations. The right to data portability, for example, does not apply in case the personal data was not provided by you or if we process the data not on the basis of your consent or for the performance of a contract.  </p><p>When you would like to exercise your rights, all you have to do is send your request to the</p><p>International Scientific Information, Inc., </p><p>Privacy Office </p><p>150 Broadhollow Rd., Ste.114 </p><p>Melville, NY 11747 U.S.A. </p><p>email: <a href="mailto:privacy.office@isi-science.com">privacy.office@isi-science.com</a>  </p><p style=""><br></p><p style=""><strong>About this policy</strong></p><p style=""> </p><p style="">This privacy policy was most recently amended on 21 May 2018 and replaces earlier versions.

Mark R. <strong class="">Graczynski</strong> and George B. <strong>Stefano</strong>, emerged from the biomedical community with a vision of creating a scientific and medical publishing enterprise, bringing together medicine and basic research disciplines under one roof. &nbsp;This concept has proven very successful. &nbsp;The business model incorporated the idea that this could be accomplished without generating debt. &nbsp;The Company today employs numerous people, taking advantage of a wide array of expertise. &nbsp;It started with one flagship journal <strong>Medical Science Monitor</strong> and now promotes over 9. &nbsp;Our model has proven itself as business continues to develop and grow. &nbsp;In summary, it has been and continues to be an exciting adventure, serving the publishing needs of our colleagues.</p>						</div>
