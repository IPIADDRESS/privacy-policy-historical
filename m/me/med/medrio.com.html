					<strong>Privacy Statement<br>
					Effective as of January 2007</strong><br>
					<br>
					Medrio, Inc. Privacy Statement: <br>
					Medrio, Inc. has created this privacy statement 
					("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to 
					customer privacy. Privacy on the Medrio, Inc. web site (the 
					"Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather 
					important information from our visitors and customers, we 
					have established this Statement as a means to communicate 
					our information gathering and dissemination practices. We 
					reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide 
					notification of the change at least thirty (30) business 
					days prior to the change taking effect.<br>
					<br>
					If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, 
					you should first contact Medrio, Inc. security administrator 
					by email at info@medrio.com. If you do not receive 
					acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been 
					satisfactorily addressed, please bring this to the attention 
					of Medrio for further resolution.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Collected Information: </strong><br>
					We may from time to time ask customers who register to use 
					the services offered on our Site (collectively, the 
					"Service") to give us contact information, such as their 
					name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail 
					address, and financial qualification and billing 
					information, such as billing name and address, credit card 
					number, and the number of users within the organization that 
					will be using the Service. At the time you express interest 
					in attaining additional information, or when you register 
					for the Service, we may also ask for additional personal 
					information, such as title, department name, fax number, or 
					additional company information, such as annual revenues, 
					number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of 
					providing this additional information. Customers can update 
					or remove their personal information at any time by logging 
					into the Website and editing their Personal Information. 
					Customers can view their updated profile to confirm their 
					edits have been made.<br>
					<br>
					Medrio, Inc. uses the information that we collect to set up 
					the Service for individuals and their organizations. We may 
					also use the information to contact customers to further 
					discuss customer interest in our company, the Service that 
					we provide, and to send information regarding our company or 
					partners, such as promotions and events. Customer email 
					addresses and any personal customer information will not be 
					distributed or shared with third parties. Customers can opt 
					out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information 
					from us, at any time by sending an email to 
					<a href="mailto:support@medrio.com">support@medrio.com</a>. Separately, customers are also asked to 
					provide an email address when registering for the Service, 
					in order to receive a username and password. We may also 
					email information regarding updates to the Service or 
					company, and may send a Customer Newsletter. Again, email 
					will not be distributed or shared.<br>
					<br>
					Except as we explicitly state at the time we request 
					information, or as provided for in the Medrio, Inc. Master 
					Subscription Agreement, we do not disclose to third parties 
					the information provided. All financial and billing 
					information that we collect through the Site is used solely 
					to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to 
					bill for the Service. This billing information is not used 
					by Medrio, Inc. for marketing or promotional purposes. 
					Medrio, Inc. uses a third-party intermediary to manage the 
					credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link 
					in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, 
					retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole 
					purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such 
					as content providers, may provide content on the web Site 
					but they are not permitted to collect any information nor 
					does Medrio, Inc. share user information with these parties.<br>
					<br>
					Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data 
					and information ("Data"). Medrio, Inc. will not review, 
					share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except 
					as provided in the Medrio, Inc. Master Subscription 
					Agreement, or as may be required by law. Individual records 
					may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of 
					resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation 
					of the Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be required 
					by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining 
					the confidentiality and security of their user registration 
					and password.<br>
					<br>
					Medrio, Inc. may also collect certain information from 
					visitors to and customers of the Site, such as Internet 
					addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose 
					technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to 
					constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also 
					track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and 
					volume statistical information from our visitors and 
					customers and provide such information to third parties.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Cookies: </strong><br>
					<br>
					When you interact with the Medrio, Inc. Website we strive to 
					make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to 
					our Web site, our Web server may send a cookie to your 
					computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a 
					computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether 
					customers and visitors have visited the Site previously.<br>
					<br>
					Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They 
					merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify 
					yourself to Medrio, Inc., either by responding to a 
					promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a 
					30-day Test Drive, you remain anonymous to Medrio, Inc. 
					Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. 
					Session cookies exist only during an online session. They 
					disappear from your computer when you close your browser 
					software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies 
					remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or 
					turned off your computer. They include such information as a 
					unique identifier for your browser.<br>
					<br>
					Medrio, Inc. uses session cookies containing encrypted 
					information to allow the system to uniquely identify you 
					while you are logged in. This information allows Medrio, 
					Inc. to process your online transactions and requests. 
					Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you 
					are after you've logged in and are required in order to use 
					the Medrio, Inc. application. Medrio, Inc. may use 
					persistent cookies that only Medrio, Inc. can read and use, 
					to identify the fact that you are a Medrio, Inc. customer or 
					prior Medrio, Inc. website visitor (whatever the case may 
					be). We are especially careful about the security and 
					confidentiality of the information stored in persistent 
					cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or 
					passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web 
					browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse 
					our Website but will not be able to successfully use our 
					Service.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Third Party Cookies:</strong> <br>
					We may from time to time engage third parties to track and 
					analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume 
					statistical information from visitors to our website to help 
					us administer our website and improve its quality. Such 
					third parties may use cookies to help track visitor 
					behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate 
					individual website visitors to any personally identifiable 
					information. All data collected by such third parties on 
					behalf of Medrio, Inc. is used only to provide us with 
					information on site usage and is not shared with any other 
					third parties.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Third Party Sites:</strong> <br>
					The Site contains links to other web sites. Medrio, Inc. is 
					not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of 
					these other web sites. Customers and visitors will need to 
					check the policy statement of these others web sites to 
					understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access 
					a linked site may be disclosing their private information. 
					It is the responsibility of the user to keep such 
					information private and confidential.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Security:</strong> <br>
					Our Site has security measures in place to help protect 
					against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under 
					our control. When our Site is accessed using Firefox or 
					Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.5 or higher, Secure 
					Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using 
					both server authentication and data encryption to help 
					ensure that Data is safe, secure, and available only to you. 
					Medrio, Inc. also implements an advanced security method 
					based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, 
					and hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses 
					a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent 
					interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, 
					Medrio, Inc. provides unique user names and passwords that 
					must be entered each time a customer logs on. These 
					safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data 
					accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Opt-Out Policy: </strong><br>
					Medrio, Inc. offers its visitors and customers a means to 
					choose how we may use information provided. If, at any time 
					after registering for information or ordering the Service, 
					you change your mind about receiving information from us or 
					about sharing your information with third parties, send us a 
					request specifying your new choice. Simply send your request 
					to <a href="mailto:support@medrio.com">support@medrio.com</a>.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Correcting &amp; Updating Your Information:</strong>
					<br>
					If customers need to update or change registration 
					information they may do so by editing the user or 
					organization record. To update billing information or 
					discontinue service please email
					<a href="mailto:support@medrio.com">support@medrio.com</a> 
					or call 866-513-4672. Medrio, Inc. will respond to your 
					correction or update request within at most 30 days from the 
					date of your request.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Additional Information:</strong> <br>
					Questions regarding this Statement or the practices of this 
					Site should be directed to Medrio, Inc. Security 
					Administrator by e-mailing such questions to
