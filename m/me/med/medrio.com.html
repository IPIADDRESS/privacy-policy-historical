						Medrio, Inc. has created this privacy policy in order to 

						demonstrate our commitment to protecting the privacy of your 

						information. Because we gather important information from you, 

						we have established this policy as a means to communicate our 

						information gathering and dissemination practices. In addition, 

						Medrio complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the 

						U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department 

						of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal 

						information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  

						Medrio has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles 

						of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and 

						enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view 

						Medrio's certification, please visit

					<br>

						<strong>Information we collect and how we use it: </strong><br>

						Medrio collects information from individuals who visit 

						our website ("Visitors") and individuals who use the 

						Medrio software service ("Customers"). <br>

						<br>

						When you request additional information about Medrio, 

						contact us via our website or register to use our 

						service, Medrio may require you to provide us with 

						contact information such as your name, company name, 

						title, address, phone number and email address. When 

						purchasing our services we may also request financial 

						qualification and billing information, such as billing 

						name and address, credit card number, and the number of 

						users within the organization that will be using the 

						Medrio software service. <br>

						<br>

						Medrio uses the information that we collect to perform 

						the services requested. For example, if you complete a 

						web contact form, Medrio will use the information 

						provided to contact you about your interest in our 

						service. <br>

						<br>

						We may also use the information that we collect for 

						marketing or other legitimate business purposes. For 

						example we may use the collected information to contact 

						you to further discuss your interest in our company, the 

						services that we provide, and to send information 

						regarding our company or partners, such as promotions 

						and events. <br>

						<br>

						All financial and billing information that we collect is 

						used solely to check the qualifications of prospective 

						customers and to bill for services. This billing 

						information is not used by us for marketing or 

						promotional purposes.<br>

						<br>

						Medrio may also collect information about your 

						interaction with our website and software service. For 

						example, we may use technologies, such as cookies 

						(described below), to collect information about the 

						pages you view, the links you click and other actions 

						you take on our sites and services. Additionally, we 

						also collect certain standard information that your 

						browser sends to every website you visit, such as your 

						IP address, access times and referring Web site 

						addresses. This information is primarily used to help 

						diagnose technical problems, for administrative 

						purposes, to compile non-identifying aggregate 

						statistics about site usage and to improve the quality 

						of our website and services. <br>

					<br>

					<strong>Cookies: </strong>

					<br>

						When you interact with the Medrio website or software 

						service, we may use cookies to help make your 

						experiences easy and meaningful. "Cookies" are a 

						technology employed by many other websites and are small 

						data files stored on your computer. Cookies cannot be 

						used to run programs or deliver viruses to your 

						computer.<br>

						<br>

						Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. 

						They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to 

						identify yourself to Medrio, either by responding to a 

						promotional offer, completing a contact or interest form 

						or registering for an account, you remain anonymous to 

						Medrio. <br>

						<br>

						There are two types of cookies, session cookies and 

						persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only during an 

						online session. They disappear from your computer when 

						you close your web browser or turn off your computer. 

						Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've 

						closed your browser or turned off your computer. They 

						include information such as a unique identifier for your 

						browser.<br>

						<br>

						Medrio uses session cookies containing encrypted 

						information to allow the system to uniquely identify you 

						while you are logged into the Medrio software service. 

						This information allows us to process your online 

						transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make 

						sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in 

						and are required in order to use the Medrio software 

						service. <br>

						<br>

						Medrio may also use persistent cookies to identify the 

						fact that you are a Medrio customer or prior Medrio 

						website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are 

						especially careful about the security and 

						confidentiality of the information stored in persistent 

						cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or 

						passwords in persistent cookies. Users can disable their 

						web browsers' ability to accept cookies and will be able 

						to browse our website but will not be able to 

						successfully use our software service.<br>

					<br>

					<strong>Third Party Cookies:</strong> <br>

						Medrio may engage third parties to track and analyze 

						non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical 

						information from visitors to our website or service for 

						marketing and administrative purposes. Such third 

						parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior. 

						Such cookies will not be used to associate individual 

						website visitors to any personally identifiable 

						information. All data collected by such third parties on 

						behalf of Medrio, Inc. is used only to provide us with 

						information on site usage and is not shared with any 

						other third parties.<br>

					<br>

					<strong>Third Party Sites:</strong> <br>

						Pages within Medrio's website and software service may 

						contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible 

						for the privacy practices or the content of these other 

						web sites. When visiting these sites you will need to 

						check the policy of these others web sites to 

						understand their policies. When accessing a linked site 

						you may be disclosing your private information. It is 

						your responsibility to keep such information private and 

						confidential.<br>

					<br>

						<strong>Sharing of collected information:</strong> <br>

						Except in the cases where we explicitly state otherwise 

						at the time we request information, or as provided for 

						in the Medrio, Master Subscription Agreement, Medrio 

						does not disclose to third parties your personally 

						identifiable information with others except as follows: 

						We may share your information with Agents who process 

						data only on our behalf and for our purposes (as used 

						here, "Agents" are persons or companies who act on 

						behalf of or under the direction of Medrio). We may 

						share your information as required by law or in the 

						interest of protecting or exercising our or others' 

						legal rights, e.g., without limitation, in connection 

						with requests from law enforcement officials and in 

						connection with court proceedings. We may share or 

						transfer your information in connection with a 

						prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other 

						reorganization of all or parts of our business. We may 

						also share information with third parties involved in 

						the normal operations of our business, for example with 

						contract research organizations (CROs), study sponsors, 

						or others that are involved in study management as 

						commonly done in our industry. We also reserve the right 

						to fully use and disclose any information that is not in 

						personally identifiable form (such as site usage 

						statistics that do not identify you individually by 

						name). <br>

						<br>

						Medrio may also use a third-party intermediary to manage 

						the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely 

						a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted 

						to store, retain, or use the information provided, 

						except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.<br>

						<br>

						Medrio will not disclose personally identifiable 

						information to any Agent unless it first either 

						ascertains that the Agent adheres to the Safe Harbor 

						Principles or is subject to the EU Directive on Data 

						Protection or another adequacy finding or enters into a 

						written agreement with such Agent requiring that the 

						Agent provide at least the same level of privacy 

						protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor 

						Principles.<br>

						<br>

						<strong>Opt-Out Policy: <br>

						</strong>Medrio, Inc. offers its visitors and customers 

						a means to choose how we may use information provided. 

						If, at any time after providing us with information, you 

						change your mind about receiving commercial information 

						from us or about sharing your information with third 

						parties, send a request specifying your new choice to

						<a href="mailto:support@medrio.com">support@medrio.com</a>.<br>

						<br>

						registration information they may do so by logging into

						<strong>Security: <br>

						</strong>Medrio has placed commercially reasonable 

						security measures in place to protect the integrity, 

						availability, and confidentiality of customer data. 

						These measures include policies, procedures, employee 

						training, physical access and logical security controls. 

						In addition when accessing the Medrio software service, 

						data transmitted to Medrio's servers are secured using 

						standard security protocols and mechanisms such as SSL 

						encryption to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.<br>

						<br>

						In the event that individual personal data is acquired, 

						or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an 

						unauthorized person and applicable law requires 

						notification, Medrio will notify the affected individual 

						of the breach by email or fax or, if Medrio is unable to 

						contact the individual by email or fax, then by U.S. 

						mail. Notice will be given promptly, consistent with the 

						legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures 

						necessary for Medrio or law enforcement to determine the 

						scope of the breach and to assure or restore the 

						integrity of the data system. Medrio may delay 

						notification if Medrio or a law enforcement agency 

						determines that the notification will impede a criminal 

						investigation, unless and until Medrio or the agency 

						determines that notification will not compromise the 

						investigation.<br>
