					<strong>Privacy Policy<br>
					Effective as of June 30th, 2010</strong><br>
					<br>
					Medrio, Inc. Privacy Policy: <br>
						<br>
						Medrio, Inc. has created this privacy policy in order to 
						demonstrate our commitment to protecting the privacy of 
						your information. Because we gather important 
						information from you, we have established this policy as 
						a means to communicate our information gathering and 
						dissemination practices. In addition, Medrio adheres to 
						the Safe Harbor Framework as agreed to and set forth by 
						the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union 
						(“EU”). For more information about the EU Safe Harbor 
						Framework, please visit
						<a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/">
						http://export.gov/safeharbor/</a>. <br>
						<br>
					<br>
						<strong>Information we collect and how we use it: </strong><br>
						Medrio collects information from individuals who visit 
						our website (“Visitors”) and individuals who use the 
						Medrio software service (“Customers”). <br>
						<br>
						When you request additional information about Medrio, 
						contact us via our website or register to use our 
						service, Medrio may require you to provide us with 
						contact information such as your name, company name, 
						title, address, phone number and email address. When 
						purchasing our services we may also request financial 
						qualification and billing information, such as billing 
						name and address, credit card number, and the number of 
						users within the organization that will be using the 
						Medrio software service. <br>
						<br>
						Medrio uses the information that we collect to perform 
						the services requested. For example, if you complete a 
						web contact form, Medrio will use the information 
						provided to contact you about your interest in our 
						service. <br>
						<br>
						We may also use the information that we collect for 
						marketing or other legitimate business purposes. For 
						example we may use the collected information to contact 
						you to further discuss your interest in our company, the 
						services that we provide, and to send information 
						regarding our company or partners, such as promotions 
						and events. <br>
						<br>
						All financial and billing information that we collect is 
						used solely to check the qualifications of prospective 
						customers and to bill for services. This billing 
						information is not used by us for marketing or 
						promotional purposes.<br>
						<br>
						Medrio may also collect information about your 
						interaction with our website and software service. For 
						example, we may use technologies, such as cookies 
						(described below), to collect information about the 
						pages you view, the links you click and other actions 
						you take on our sites and services. Additionally, we 
						also collect certain standard information that your 
						browser sends to every website you visit, such as your 
						IP address, access times and referring Web site 
						addresses. This information is primarily used to help 
						diagnose technical problems, for administrative 
						purposes, to compile non-identifying aggregate 
						statistics about site usage and to improve the quality 
						of our website and services. <br>
					<br>
					<strong>Cookies: </strong>
					<br>
						When you interact with the Medrio website or software 
						service, we may use cookies to help make your 
						experiences easy and meaningful. “Cookies” are a 
						technology employed by many other websites and are small 
						data files stored on your computer. Cookies cannot be 
						used to run programs or deliver viruses to your 
						computer.<br>
						<br>
						Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. 
						They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to 
						identify yourself to Medrio, either by responding to a 
						promotional offer, completing a contact or interest form 
						or registering for an account, you remain anonymous to 
						Medrio. <br>
						<br>
						There are two types of cookies, session cookies and 
						persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only during an 
						online session. They disappear from your computer when 
						you close your web browser or turn off your computer. 
						Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've 
						closed your browser or turned off your computer. They 
						include information such as a unique identifier for your 
						browser.<br>
						<br>
						Medrio uses session cookies containing encrypted 
						information to allow the system to uniquely identify you 
						while you are logged into the Medrio software service. 
						This information allows us to process your online 
						transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make 
						sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in 
						and are required in order to use the Medrio software 
						service. <br>
						<br>
						Medrio may also use persistent cookies to identify the 
						fact that you are a Medrio customer or prior Medrio 
						website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are 
						especially careful about the security and 
						confidentiality of the information stored in persistent 
						cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or 
						passwords in persistent cookies. Users can disable their 
						web browsers' ability to accept cookies and will be able 
						to browse our website but will not be able to 
						successfully use our software service.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Third Party Cookies:</strong> <br>
						Medrio may engage third parties to track and analyze 
						non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical 
						information from visitors to our website or service for 
						marketing and administrative purposes. Such third 
						parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior. 
						Such cookies will not be used to associate individual 
						website visitors to any personally identifiable 
						information. All data collected by such third parties on 
						behalf of Medrio, Inc. is used only to provide us with 
						information on site usage and is not shared with any 
						other third parties.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Third Party Sites:</strong> <br>
						Pages within Medrio’s website and software service may 
						contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible 
						for the privacy practices or the content of these other 
						web sites. When visiting these sites you will need to 
						check the policy policy of these others web sites to 
						understand their policies. When accessing a linked site 
						you may be disclosing your private information. It is 
						your responsibility to keep such information private and 
						confidential.<br>
					<br>
						<strong>Sharing of collected information:</strong> <br>
						Except in the cases where we explicitly state otherwise 
						at the time we request information, or as provided for 
						in the Medrio, Master Subscription Agreement, Medrio 
						does not disclose to third parties your personally 
						identifiable information with others except as follows: 
						We may share your information with Agents who process 
						data only on our behalf and for our purposes (as used 
						here, “Agents” are persons or companies who act on 
						behalf of or under the direction of Medrio). We may 
						share your information as required by law or in the 
						interest of protecting or exercising our or others' 
						legal rights, e.g., without limitation, in connection 
						with requests from law enforcement officials and in 
						connection with court proceedings. We may share or 
						transfer your information in connection with a 
						prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other 
						reorganization of all or parts of our business. We may 
						also share information with third parties involved in 
						the normal operations of our business, for example with 
						contract research organizations (CROs), study sponsors, 
						or others that are involved in study management as 
						commonly done in our industry. We also reserve the right 
						to fully use and disclose any information that is not in 
						personally identifiable form (such as site usage 
						statistics that do not identify you individually by 
						name). <br>
						<br>
						Medrio may also use a third-party intermediary to manage 
						the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely 
						a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted 
						to store, retain, or use the information provided, 
						except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.<br>
						<br>
						Medrio will not disclose personally identifiable 
						information to any Agent unless it first either 
						ascertains that the Agent adheres to the Safe Harbor 
						Principles or is subject to the EU Directive on Data 
						Protection or another adequacy finding or enters into a 
						written agreement with such Agent requiring that the 
						Agent provide at least the same level of privacy 
						protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor 
						Principles.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Opt-Out Policy: <br>
						</strong>Medrio, Inc. offers its visitors and customers 
						a means to choose how we may use information provided. 
						If, at any time after providing us with information, you 
						change your mind about receiving commercial information 
						from us or about sharing your information with third 
						parties, send a request specifying your new choice to
						<a href="mailto:support@medrio.com">support@medrio.com</a>.<br>
						<br>
						Customers can not opt-out of receiving emails from 
						Medrio that are directly related to their use of the 
						Medrio software service such as email notifications, or 
						service notifications.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Correcting &amp; Updating Your Information: <br>
						</strong>If customers need to update or change 
						registration information they may do so by logging into 
						the Medrio software service and editing the user 
						profile. To update billing information or to have your 
						information deleted please email support@medrio.com or 
						call 877-763-3746. Medrio, Inc. will respond to your 
						correction or update request within at most 30 days from 
						the date of your request.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Customer Data:<br>
						</strong>Customers of the Service will be using the 
						Medrio software service to host data and information 
						("Data"). Medrio will not review, share, distribute, 
						print, or reference any such Data except as provided in 
						the Medrio Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be 
						required by law. Individual records may at times be 
						viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a 
						problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the 
						Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be required by 
						law. Of course, customers are responsible for 
						maintaining the confidentiality and security of their 
						user registration and password.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Security: <br>
						</strong>Medrio has placed commercially reasonable 
						security measures in place to protect the integrity, 
						availability, and confidentiality of customer data. 
						These measures include policies, procedures, employee 
						training, physical access and logical security controls. 
						In addition when accessing the Medrio software service, 
						data transmitted to Medrio’s servers are secured using 
						standard security protocols and mechanisms such as SSL 
						encryption to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.<br>
						<br>
						In the event that individual personal data is acquired, 
						or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an 
						unauthorized person and applicable law requires 
						notification, Medrio will notify the affected individual 
						of the breach by email or fax or, if Medrio is unable to 
						contact the individual by email or fax, then by U.S. 
						mail. Notice will be given promptly, consistent with the 
						legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures 
						necessary for Medrio or law enforcement to determine the 
						scope of the breach and to assure or restore the 
						integrity of the data system. Medrio may delay 
						notification if Medrio or a law enforcement agency 
						determines that the notification will impede a criminal 
						investigation, unless and until Medrio or the agency 
						determines that notification will not compromise the 
						investigation.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Enforcement: <br>
						</strong>Medrio has established internal mechanisms to 
						verify its ongoing adherence to its privacy policy, 
						including the Safe Harbor Principles. Medrio also 
						encourages individuals covered by this privacy policy to 
						raise any concerns about our processing of personal 
						information by contacting Medrio at the address below. 
						Medrio will seek to resolve any concerns. Medrio has 
						also agreed to participate in the dispute resolution 
						program provided by the European Data Protection 
						Authorities<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Policy Updates:<br>
						</strong>Medrio reserves the right to change this 
						Privacy Policy and will provide notification of the 
						change by posting a prominent notice on the privacy 
						section of our web site 
						notifying users of the change. <br>
