                    <p>(mt) Media Temple typically receives specific data about its 
                      website visitors only when such information is provided 
                      voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, 
                      purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support 
                      inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment 
                      opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these 
                      activities require that you give us information, such as 
                      when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, 
                      submit your resume, or request certain types of information. 
                      When you provide personally-identifiable information to 
                      (mt) Media Temple through one of our websites, it will be used 
                      to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will

                      your information by sending an e-mail to contact@mediatemple.net, 
                      however, (mt) Media Temple reserves the right, in its discretion, 
                      to send you bulletins and other important information about 
                      your (mt) Media Temple services. Absent any instructions from 
                      you, (mt) Media Temple may use information you provide to inform 
                      you about additional services and products offered by the

                      case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. 
                      On those (Mt0 Media Temple sites where you may provide (mt) Media 
                      Temple with credit card or other ordering information via 
                      the web, (mt) Media Temple protects and secures this information 
                      by employing commercially customary web-based security and 
                      encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket 
                      Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). On 
                      those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, 
                      answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the 
                      like, (mt) Media Temple will treat that portion of the information 
                      as non-confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise 
                      expressed in this privacy statement, Media Temple assumes

                    <p>In general, (mt) Media Temple gathers some generic information 
                      automatically. Generic information does not reveal the identity 
                      of the visitor. It usually includes information about the 
                      Internet address assigned to your computer, the number and 
                      frequency of visitors, and the (mt) Media Temple sites visited.

                      of determining customer service and website needs. We accomplish 
                      this by using certain technologies, including "cookies" 
                      (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with 
                      tailored information about (mt) Media Temple services). (mt) Media

                      your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and 
                      you can refuse it; this may however reduce functionality of certain website features such as the order system and the AccountCenter. </p>

                    <p>Information that you disclose in a public space, including

                    <p><strong>D. Exceptions and Limitations:</strong></p>
