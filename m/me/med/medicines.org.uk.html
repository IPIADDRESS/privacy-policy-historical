<h2>
    Content and site availability disclaimers</h2>
<p>
    Every effort is taken to ensure that the information published on this website is
    accurate and kept up to date in terms of current medical knowledge. However, whilst
    we only accept information from respected sources we cannot guarantee that all of
    the information displayed is accurate or complete, nor can we guarantee that it
    will be suitable for a user's individual circumstances. This website is therefore
    provided for information only. It is not intended to replace a consultation with
    an appropriately qualified medical practitioner.
</p>
<p>
    Documents published on the eMC are as regulated by the MHRA or EMA. It is the responsibility
    of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to check that their documents are correct
    and up to date. If Datapharm becomes aware of an error in a regulated document,
    it informs the MAH. Normally the MAH will re-submit a corrected document to the
    MHRA or EMA for approval but this is at their sole discretion. If we are asked
    by the MAH to update the eMC in advance of the new document gaining MHRA or EMA
    approval we will do so. If we are made aware that advice, warnings or guidance has
    been issued from the MHRA, EMA or other competent authority which relates to the
    content of documents on the eMC we will use all reasonable efforts to include a hyperlink from that document to
    the relevant information on the website of the authority issuing the advice, warning
    or guidance and inform the MAH that we have done so. The absence of any such hyperlink
    does not mean that no advice, warning, or guidance has ever been given and users
    are advised to check with the MAH to ensure the document is up to date.
</p>
<p>
    The inclusion of third party articles or reports in the Regulatory News section
    of the site or elsewhere does not imply any endorsement of the contents thereof
    by Datapharm.
</p>
<p>
    Datapharm does not accept responsibility for any loss, damage or injury that arises
    from the use of this website except to the extent that liability cannot be excluded
    by law.
</p>
<p>
    We make every effort to ensure that this website is available at all times. To achieve
    this we do the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Host the site within a fully managed solution monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days
        a year.</li>
    <li>Use industry standard software for the servers and the website;</li>
    <li>Have well developed security arrangements;</li>
    <li>Have well developed monitoring, maintenance and repair procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In spite of these efforts we cannot guarantee uninterrupted access to this website,
    or the sites to which it links. We accept no responsibility for any damages arising
    from the loss of use of this information.

<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
<p>
    Datapharm is committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals using our websites. The following statement discloses the legal and privacy practices for all Datapharm websites, including those under the medicines.org.uk <a href="http://www.medicines.org.uk">http://www.medicines.org.uk</a> domain.
</p>
<a name="information"></a>
<h3>Information collection and use</h3>
<p>
    Datapharm does not collect or store any personally identifiable information about website users, unless you voluntarily provide this information.  You might voluntarily provide information when you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>contact us - we may keep a copy of the correspondence</li>
<li>register to use Datapharm services</li>
<li>log into any of the Datapharm websites</li>
<li>fill in a form to attend a Datapharm event, meeting or training session</li>
<li>voluntarily complete a survey for research purposes </li>
</ul>
<p>
We always aim to ensure that the personally identifiable information that we collect will be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed. Datapharm does not sell personal information it has gathered about you to third parties.
</p>
<p>
Datapharm may use the information you provide us to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>respond to your requests</li>
<li>notify you about changes to our services</li>
<li>carry out obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and Datapharm</li>
<li>provide you with relevant information, products, services and training</li>
</ul>
<p>
Datapharm will disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties only under exceptional circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is under a legal obligation to do so.  For example, if you provide safety data about a medicine we are obliged to pass this information to the company that markets that medicine so that they can fulfil their safety reporting obligation.</li>
<li>If third party suppliers need it to perform a contracted role.  For example, if a pharmaceutical company submits product information via In-Demand, the NHSBSA may need to contact the pharmaceutical company with questions about the data.</li>
<li>if we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Users of our websites</h3>
<p>
When you use our websites, we collect non-personally identifiable information and details of visitor behaviour patterns.

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
We may from time to time use various cookies that retain information about you and your use of our websites.
</p>
<p>
A cookie is a small piece of data that is transferred from a website, via your web browser and is automatically stored on your computer's hard drive.  Cookies are widely used to make websites work or make them work better.

We use this information to improve our websites and deliver a better personalised service. 
</p>
<p>
We use a number of different cookies on our websites.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Persistent cookies:</b> if you log on to a restricted section of our website, we may set a cookie on your PC to remember your login details. We may also set a cookie on your machine if we redirect you to, or you choose to use, the mobile-friendly version of the eMC. These cookies stays on your computer indefinitely, even after you leave our websites.</li>
<li><b>Session cookies:</b> we use these to remember your preferences during your visit. For example, if you prefer to see 10 or 25 search results per page on the desktop eMC, or, whether you only want to search for SPCs on the mobile-friendly eMC. Session cookies are stored only temporarily during the browsing sessions and are deleted once the browser is closed.</li>
<li><b>Flash cookies:</b> we may use Adobe Flash Player in the future to deliver video content. Adobe uses their own cookies to store information about preferences and tracking users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies may be:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>First party cookies:</b> these cookies are set by the Datapharm websites you visit.</li>
<li><b>Third party cookies:</b> these cookies are set by a site/service outside of Datapharm. For example, the website might use embedded YouTube or Flickr content, or use third party advertising, and these sites may set their own cookies.</li>
