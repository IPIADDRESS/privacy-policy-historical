								<br>
								<p class="MsoBodyText">We have structured our websites so that, in general, you
								can visit Med Help on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any
								personal information if you so choose. Your access may be limited to browsing
								and searching our medical libraries.</p>
								<br>
								<p class="MsoBodyText">Please remember that any information (including personal
								and medical information) that you reveal in a public forum (such as a medical
								forum, bulletin board, mail list, chat room/event) is not subject to this
								Privacy Policy and will be seen by third parties not related to Med Help and our
								subsidiaries and may be used by them to contact you or for unauthorized
								purposes. Also, if you leave our site via a link to a third party site, any
								information you reveal on that site is not subject to this Privacy Policy -- you
								should consult the privacy policies of each site you visit.</p>

								<br>
								<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u><span>Security</span></u></b></p>


								<p class="MsoBodyText">Security is a matter of protecting data from unintended
								use, loss, misuse, counterfeit, and accidental or unauthorized alteration. It
								extends from data collection through storage, retrieval and processing through
								transmission. It includes backup and recovery procedures. We have installed a
								number of security measures to protect the confidentiality of your personal
								information. These include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Your personal information lives in a separate database that is not
										available on the Internet.&nbsp;
									</li><li>We use industry-standard encryption methods when transmitting
										credit card information over the Internet.
									</li><li>You are identified on our website by your <b>Member or Nickname</b>
										and <b>Password</b> only.
								</li></ul>
								<br>
								<p class="MsoBodyText">However, please remember that you play an important part
								in security as well. Your password should never be shared with anyone and should
								be changed frequently. Remember that any information you voluntarily disclose
								on-line in any news or message postings, discussion groups or chat rooms may be
								collected and used by others without your permission. Furthermore, if you
								provide any information to parties who operate Web sites that are linked to or
								from our site, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure
								of your personal information. We encourage you to review these sites' policies
								before revealing any sensitive or personal information. </p>
								<p class="MsoBodyText">Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us,
								"perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant
								the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such
								information at your own risk. </p>
								<br>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><b><u>IP Addresses</u></b></p>

								An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
								access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted
								with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and
								communicate with each other. We collect IP addresses in order to conduct system
								administration, report aggregate information to sponsors and advertisers, and to
								conduct site analysis. If a visitor requests pages from Med Help, the Med Help
								servers enter the visitor's IP address into a log. To maintain visitor
								anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal
								information.&nbsp;
								<br>
								<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u><span>
								Third Party Advertising</span></u></b></p>
								<p class="MsoBodyText">Sponsors, partners or advertisers on our site may also
								use their own cookies when you click on their advertisement or link to their
								site or service, or even if the advertisement simply appears on a page that you
								are viewing. Third party advertisers are used to serve their ads on our site and
								these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect non-personal information through
								the use of cookies. We do not control these third parties' use of cookies, or
								how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them.&nbsp; You
								should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our
								site to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the
								information they collect through the use of cookies on their own sites. Med Help
								explicitly identifies sponsors and advertisers on our site as much as is
								possible.</p>
								<br>
								<p class="MsoBodyText">We use third-party advertising
								companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use
								information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone
								number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide
								advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be
								of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and
								to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,

								this Privacy Policy</span></u></b></p>
								<p class="MsoBodyText">It may be necessary from time to time for us to modify
