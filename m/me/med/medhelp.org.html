        <div class="subtitle">MedHelp's Commitment to Privacy</div><br>

        An ancient precept in the field of medicine says, "Primum non nocere", or "First of all, do no harm."
        <br><br>
        Med Help is dedicated to protecting the privacy of our visitors and to ensuring that our information is 
        accurate, complete, and up-to-date. To be useful we must gain and earn the trust and confidence of our 
        members and visitors. Therefore, with the help of the Med Help membership, we strive to maintain the highest 
        possible level of integrity. Our principals are based on the best codes of practice and ethical standards. 
        We invite suggestions on how we can do better.
        <br><br>
        We understand that health is a very personal subject and we want our Members and Visitors to be as comfortable 
        as possible while visiting our website and using our services.  This policy tells you, among other things, what 
        information we gather from you, how we may use or disclose that information and our efforts to protect it. 
        Please read this policy carefully, and feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding its contents
        <br><br> 
        
        <div class="subtitle">Types of Information Collected</div><br>
        In connection with your use of our site, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from and about 
        you in different ways. For example, when you register to use our site, we ask for and store your name, address, 
        email address and other identifying contact data. We may also collect the information you disclose in any of our 
        chat rooms, discussion groups and bulletin boards, or that you voluntarily provide to us through responses to 
        surveys, questionnaires and the like and through your use of information storage facilities on our sites.
        <br><br>
                
        <div class="subtitle">Cookies</div><br>   
        Cookies were originally designed to help a website distinguish a user's browser as a previous visitor 
        and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. 
        Currently, websites use cookies to enhance the user's visit; in general, cookies can securely store a user's 
        ID and password, personalize home pages, or identify which parts of a site have been visited.
        <br><br>

        You may set your web browser to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely. In 
        addition, you can delete the files that contain cookies; those files are stored as part of your Internet 
        browser, however, if you delete cookies that have been sent from our site, this will cause you to reenter 
        data (e.g. login again).
        <br><br>
                
        <div class="subtitle">Use of Information</div><br> 
        Med Help uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. 
        We use your personally identifying information to identify and register you as a user of the site. We 
        also use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you 
        on our services and benefits, and to personalize our web sites for you. For example, we may also associate 
        your personally identifying information with information we collect about your preferences and activities 
        at the site, such as the particular pages you request at the site and purchases or other transactions you 
        effect through the site. We may vary the content you receive in future visits to the site based on your 
        preferences and activities. 
        <br><br>
        Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained on our system without your 
        permission.
        <br><br>
        From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you to provide you with medical information 
        we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we always give you the opportunity to opt out of 
        receiving such information in the future by sending a blank email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@medhelp.org">unsubscribe@medhelp.org</a>. 
        <br><br>
                
        <div class="subtitle">Disclosure of Information</div><br>

        Except as set forth in this policy, Med Help and its subsidiaries will not disclose to unaffiliated companies 
        any information it gathers from you which could be used to identify or contact you.  Any personal information 
        provided to entities affiliated with the Med Help website will be treated in accordance with the terms of this 
        Privacy Policy, unless you are otherwise notified.
        <br><br>
        <div class="bold">Aggregate Information</div>
        We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted 
        ("Aggregate Information"). Aggregate Information might include collective profiles of our user groups and their 
        activities and preferences. Such Aggregate Information may also be disclosed in describing our site and services 
        to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.  For example, we 
        might inform third parties regarding the number of Member or Visitors of our site and the activities they conduct 
        while on our site. We might also inform a pharmaceutical company (that may or may not be a sponsor) of the total 
        number of page views in a particular forum.
        Privacy Policy, unless you are otherwise notified.
        <br><br>
        
        <div class="bold">Successor Entities</div>
        In the event that our business related to this site is sold, we may transfer the information we collect to a 
        successor entity provided that such successor agrees to protect the information in the manner described in 
        this policy.
        Privacy Policy, unless you are otherwise notified.
        <br><br>
        
        <div class="bold">Legally Required Disclosures</div>

        Finally, we may disclose information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in 
        good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent harm.  
        Privacy Policy, unless you are otherwise notified.
        <br><br>
                
        <div class="subtitle">Accessing and Changing Your Information</div><br>
        You may change the personal information contained in your profile. Once confirmed, any new item of information will replace the corresponding information previously provided.
        <br><br> 
        You may not change the following types of information:

        <ul>
            <li>Material that the Member or Visitor has posted in a Public Forum and any other material that the Member or Visitor similarly has caused to be made available to other Site Members or to Site visitors.
            </li><li>Material that the Member or Visitor has posted in a Chat Area.
            </li><li>Material that the Member or Visitor has posted or otherwise sent to Med Help staff members or representatives. While confidentiality rules may apply to such material, the Member or Visitor does not own the data. This includes e-mail and all other written correspondence.    
        </li></ul>
        
        <div class="subtitle">Children</div><br>

        Med Help conforms to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act [COPPA]. We will never knowingly request 
        personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent. When we do 
        receive information (with parental consent) from users under the age of 13, we will never voluntarily share 
        their personally identifiable information with third parties, regardless of their stated preference given at 
        registration.
        <br><br>        
        
        <div class="subtitle">Your Privacy Choices</div><br>
        Participation on our site is purely voluntary and you may opt-out at any time by notifying us via 
        an email message to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@medhelp.org">unsubscribe@medhelp.org</a>. Upon receipt of your request to "opt-out", we will remove 
        you from all future mailings and not contact you.  In addition, we will not send unsolicited messages to 
        users of our site who indicate that they do not wish to receive such messages. If you do not wish to 
        receive unsolicited email messages from us, please contact us.
        <br><br>
        We have structured our websites so that, in general, you can visit Med Help on the Web without identifying 
        yourself or revealing any personal information if you so choose. Your access may be limited to browsing and 
        searching our medical libraries.
        <br><br>
        Please remember that any information (including personal and medical information) that you reveal in a 
        public forum (such as a medical forum, bulletin board, mail list, chat room/event) is not subject to this 
        Privacy Policy and will be seen by third parties not related to Med Help and our subsidiaries and may be 
        used by them to contact you or for unauthorized purposes. Also, if you leave our site via a link to a third 
        party site, any information you reveal on that site is not subject to this Privacy Policy -- you should 
        consult the privacy policies of each site you visit.
        <br><br>
                
        <div class="subtitle">Security</div><br> 
        Security is a matter of protecting data from unintended use, loss, misuse, counterfeit, and accidental 
        or unauthorized alteration. It extends from data collection through storage, retrieval and processing through 
        transmission. It includes backup and recovery procedures. We have installed a number of security measures to 
        protect the confidentiality of your personal information. These include:

        <ul>

            <li>Your personal information lives in a separate database that is not available on the Internet. 
            </li><li>We use industry-standard encryption methods when transmitting credit card information over the Internet.
            </li><li>You are identified on our website by your Member or Nickname and Password only.  
        </li></ul>
    
        However, please remember that you play an important part in security as well. Your password should never be 
        shared with anyone and should be changed frequently. Remember that any information you voluntarily disclose 
        on-line in any news or message postings, discussion groups or chat rooms may be collected and used by others 
        without your permission. Furthermore, if you provide any information to parties who operate Web sites that 
        are linked to or from our site, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your 
        personal information. We encourage you to review these sites' policies before revealing any sensitive or 
        personal information.
        <br><br>
        Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We 
        cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information 
        at your own risk.
        <br><br>            
        
        <div class="subtitle">IP Addresses</div><br> 
        An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All 
        computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers 
        to recognize and communicate with each other. We collect IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, 
        report aggregate information to sponsors and advertisers, and to conduct site analysis. If a visitor requests 
        pages from Med Help, the Med Help servers enter the visitor's IP address into a log. To maintain visitor 
        anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information.   
        <br><br> 
                
        <div class="subtitle">Third Party Advertising</div><br>

        Sponsors, partners or advertisers on our site may also use their own cookies when you click on their 
        advertisement or link to their site or service, or even if the advertisement simply appears on a page 
        that you are viewing. Third party advertisers are used to serve their ads on our site and these companies 
        ("Ad Servers") may also collect non-personal information through the use of cookies. We do not control 
        these third parties' use of cookies, or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through 
        them.  You should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our site to understand
        how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies 
        on their own sites. Med Help explicitly identifies sponsors and advertisers on our site as much as is possible.
        <br><br> 
        We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please contact us 
        <br><br> 
                
        <div class="subtitle">Changes to this Privacy Policy</div><br>
        It may be necessary from time to time for us to modify this policy to reflect changes in the way we 
        collect and use information or changes in privacy-related laws, regulations, and industry standards. 
        Accordingly, we reserve the right to change this policy at any time by posting the revised policy on 
        this web site. Please visit this site frequently in order to be informed of any such changes. This 
        policy was posted on November 8, 2006.  Data will be handled in accordance with the policy in effect 
        at the time the data is collected. 
        <br><br>        
        
        <div class="subtitle">Contact Us</div><br>   
        Please do not hesitate to <a href="contactus.htm">contact us</a> if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or our Website in general. You can reach us via our  contact page.
        <br><br>
        Again, your privacy and its protection is paramount to us!
