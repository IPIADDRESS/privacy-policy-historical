				  <p><strong>Client Information Collection and Use</strong> Mediacoltd is the sole owner of the information collected on this   website. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to any third   parties in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.   Mediacoltd collects information from its Advertisers and Traffic Partners   (the "Clients") as well as from Internet users who initiate keyword   searches from sites operated by our Traffic Partners (the "Internet   Users") at several different points on our website.</p>
                  <p><strong>Client Registration</strong> In order to become an Advertiser and Traffic Partner, a user must first   complete our online registration form. During registration, a user is   required to provide their contact information (including name, email   address, physical address and telephone number).</p>
                  <p><strong>Regular Communication with Clients</strong> As part of our process in serving our Clients, we routinely communicate   via email, mail or telephone with our Clients. In addition to our   initial welcome letter, our Clients receive account activity reports,   low balance warnings, funding confirmation emails, site and service   announcement updates, and other information relating to the management   of their Mediacoltd accounts. Clients also receive emails directly from a   member of our team offering optimization or other services designed to   assist Clients. Out of respect for the privacy of our Clients, we will   honor every request not receive these types of communications.</p>
                  <p><strong>Newsletter to Clients</strong> Our Clients receive a regular newsletter from us. If a Client wishes to   unsubscribe to our newsletters, he or she may do so by unsubscribing   directly from our newsletter. We do not sell, share, or rent our   newsletter email list to any third party.</p>
                  <p><strong>Client Surveys</strong> From time-to-time, we may request information from our Clients by email   or through an online survey. Participation in these surveys is   completely voluntary and the Client therefore has a choice whether or   not to disclose any of the requested information. Information requested   may include contact information (such as name and address), demographic   information (such as zip code, age and income level), information about   other forms of online advertising that is used by the Client,   information related to the Client's experience as a Mediacoltd Advertiser   or Traffic Partner, and information related to the business of the   Client. Information that we gather in this way is intended to get   important feedback from our Clients with the purpose of improving the   quality of our services. We may share the information that we collect,   but no information will be attributed to any individual Client without   written authorization from the Client.</p>
                  <p><strong>Collection of Data from Internet Users</strong> Mediacoltd does not collect Internet User identity or contact   information from Internet Users' visits to Mediacoltd's website or to any   of its Traffic Partner websites. For each visitor to a Mediacoltd   website or to any of its Traffic Partner websites, the visitor's   computer reaches us via a particular Internet Protocol (the "IP")   address. Mediacoltd's servers automatically collect this IP address.</p>
                  <p><strong>Sharing of Client Information</strong> We will share aggregated demographic information with our Traffic   Partners and Advertisers from time-to-time. The information that we may   share is not linked to any personal information that can identify any   individual user.</p>
                  <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong> This website contains links to other sites. Please be advised that   Mediacoltd is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other   sites that link to or from Mediacoltd. We encourage our Clients to be   aware that privacy policies may differ when they leave our site and to   read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects   personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies   solely to information collected by this website and through Traffic   Partner websites.</p>
                  <p><strong>Corrections/Updating Personal Information</strong> If our Clients' personally identifiable information changes, or if a   user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to   correct, update or remove that user's personal data. This can be done   within the "Admin" section of our Account Management Interface or by   contacting our Advertiser Services Team through our contact page.</p>
                  <p><strong>www.Mediacoltd.com</strong></p>
                  <p>We have the right to change our privacy policy at   any time. If we do so, we will post those changes in this section of our   website so that our Clients are always aware of what information we   collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we   disclose such information.  	If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in   a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we   will notify Clients by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or   not we use their information in this different manner. We will use   information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the   information was collected.</p>
