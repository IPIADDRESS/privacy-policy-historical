In really tough situations, like when we got dumped that one time, we might just need to vent about how unfair life is. Except for that last scenario, which won’t actually happen, these administrative communications are considered a basic part of Medium Services, and you may not be able to opt out from receiving them. You can always opt out of non-administrative emails.</p><p name="e5c6" class="post-p"><a id="e5c6"></a>We will never email you to ask for your password or other account information.

By default, whatever you share through Medium Services is public. Although we do provide tools that let you write and edit draft content prior to publication, you should assume that any content you provide us may become publicly accessible.</p><p name="bfb4" class="post-p"><a id="bfb4"></a>Content published and shared through Medium Services is publicly accessible, which means that everyone, including search engines, will be able to see it. This content may also be copied and shared by others throughout the Internet, including through features native to Medium Services, such as commenting and embedding.</p><p name="b971" class="post-p"><a id="b971"></a>You are free to remove published content from your account, or even disable your account entirely. However, because of the fundamentally open nature of the Internet, the strong possibility that others will comment on or embed your content, and technological limitations inherent to Medium Services, copies of your content may exist elsewhere indefinitely, including in our systems.</p><h4 name="b00c" class="post-h4"><a id="b00c"></a><strong class="post-h4Strong">Cookies</strong></h4><p name="50ef" class="post-p"><a id="50ef"></a>A cookie is a small piece of text, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website.</p><p name="d98f" class="post-p"><a id="d98f"></a>We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use Medium Services. We use cookies to identify whether you have logged in and recognize that your web browser has accessed aspects of Medium Services, and we may associate that information with your account if you have one. This information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on Medium Services when you are logged in. To measure the deliverability of our emails to users, we may embed information in them, such as a web beacon or tag.</p><p name="f83e" class="post-p"><a id="f83e"></a>Most browsers have an option for disabling cookies, but if you disable them you won’t be able to log into your Medium account, and won’t be able to use the vast majority of Medium Services.</p><p name="f7f8" class="post-p"><a id="f7f8"></a>We respect <a href="https://medium.com/policy/how-we-handle-do-not-track-requests-on-medium-f2b4b4fb7c5e" class="post-anchor post-pAnchor">Do Not Track</a> (“DNT”) settings in browsers. If you are logged out of our services and have DNT enabled, we will not set cookies that can be used to aggregate information about your usage.
