		       <h2>Overview</h2>
		       <p>MedHunters.com Inc. ("MedHunters") is committed
			 to providing you with a safe, secure environment
			 from which you can confidently register,
			 apply for jobs and receive our job matching
			 services. To demonstrate our firm commitment
			 to assuring your privacy, MedHunters has
			 created this privacy statement to explain
			 the information gathering, storage and dissemination
			 practices we use on our Site. Our promise
			 to you is that we will use our best efforts
			 to ensure that the information you submit
			 to us remains private, and will only be used
			 for the purposes described herein.</p>
		       <p>By accessing, using and/or registering on
			 this Site, you consent to the policies and
			 practices described in this statement.</p>
		       <p>Note that this Site is also governed by
			 the <a href="/termsOfUse.html">Terms and
			   Conditions of Use</a>. Please review these
			 policies before using this Site.</p>
		       <h2>Collection of Information</h2>
		       <h3>Anonymous browsing</h3>
		       <p>You can use our Site without revealing any
			 information about yourself. In this case,
			 we gather or may gather certain information
			 about your use of our Site, such as what
			 areas you visit and what services you access.
			 Our web server may collect the following
			 information about your computer hardware
			 and software: IP address, domain name, browser
			 type and version, operating system type and
			 version, the referring web site, the web
			 site you visit next, and access times. </p>
		       <p>This information is used to evaluate different
			 aspects of the MedHunters Site, including
			 monitoring Site performance for systems administration
			 purposes, improving the functionality of
			 the Site, and reporting aggregate information
			 to our clients and prospective customers
			 (e.g. how much traffic we get to the Site).
			 Statistics about traffic patterns and Site
			 usage are reported on an aggregate basis
			 only and do not include any personal information
			 that identifies individuals.</p>
		       <h3>Collection, Retention, Disclosure and Use
			 of Information</h3>
		       <p>When you register on MedHunters, we require
			 the following information from you: name,
			 address, telephone number, email address,
			 work history, educational history, location
			 preferences, desired work status, licensure,
			 and employment eligibility. You will also
			 be asked to provide a copy of your résumé
			 for our database. This information is used
			 to create an online, searchable profile that
			 can be accessed by the employers who advertise
			 on our Site or who have database access to
			 our Site.</p>
		       <p>We use this information to: 1) provide advertisers
			 with aggregate information about our job
			 seeker database, 2) provide Site developers
			 with information that will enable them to
			 develop appropriate content, features and
			 services, and 3) inform you of job opportunities
			 that may interest you. You have two options
			 with respect to privacy when you register
			 on MedHunters:</p>
		       <ol>
			 <li>You can store your résumé
			   in our database but indicate that you would
			   like all of your contact information kept
			   confidential. This means that employers
			   will not be able to see any information
			   by which you could be identified, including
			   your contact information, names of current
			   and past employers and educational institution(s)
			   attended. Employers will only be able to
			   see a profile that contains the job title(s)
			   you have held, years of work experience,
			   the degrees you hold (but not educational
			   institution). Employers will also be able
			   to see your dates of registration and last
			   contact with MedHunters as well as your
			   location of preference. You can use your
			   confidential online résumé
			   to apply for jobs, in which case such application
			   constitutes a release of all your personal
			   information. </li>
			 <li>You can store your résumé
			   in our database and allow it to be searchable
			   by employers. In this case, employers will
			   have access to all of the information you
			   provided to register on MedHunters, including
			   but not limited to your contact information,
			   work history and educational history. </li>
		       </ol>
		       <p>You can change your privacy preferences
			 at any time by logging into your MedHunters
			 account or by contacting our Job Seeker Services
			 team at 800-664-0278 or <a href="mailto:jobseekers@medhunters.com">jobseekers@medhunters.com</a>.
			 </p>
		       <p>Should you choose to keep all of your information
			 confidential, employers can send you emails
			 through your MyMedHunters account. Your information
			 will only be released when you either send
			 us an email indicating that you would like
			 your information released to a specific employer,
			 or apply directly online to an employer.
			 Online application constitutes a release
			 of your personal information.</p>
		       <p>Access to our résumé database
			 is restricted only to subscribing employers,
			 law enforcement and national security agencies.
			 MedHunters cannot guarantee that other parties
			 will not gain access to this database. You
			 may remove your résumé from
			 our database at any time or change your privacy
			 preferences. However, employers who currently
			 have access to that database or who have
			 had access to the database in the past, as
			 well as parties who have otherwise gained
			 access to the database, may have retained
			 a copy of your résumé in their
			 own files or databases. We are not responsible
			 for the retention, use or privacy of résumés
			 in these instances.</p>
		       <p>We may also use, disclose and communicate
			 your personal information if required to
			 do so by the law including by an order of
			 the court.</p>
		       <p>Your job application history is retained
			 on our system. You are able to see your job
			 application history for six months, to enable
			 you to see which jobs you have recently applied
			 for. Only you personally and MedHunters employees
			 are able to see your job application history.
			 Should you choose to remove your résumé
			 from our database or close your MyMedHunters
			 account, we will remove your résumé,
			 and MyMedHunters profile information from
			 our externally visible system. Please note
			 that a copy of any information that you have
			 provided may remain in back-up storage for
			 some period of time after your deletion request.
			 This may be the case even though no information
			 about your account remains in our active
			 user databases and is not visible to yourself
			 or to subscribing employers.</p>
		       <p>Some job postings on the MedHunters Site
			 link directly to the employer�s web
			 site and require you to enter your information
			 into their system in order to apply. In such
			 cases, you will be providing your résumé
			 directly to the employer and your résumé
			 will be subject to their privacy policy.
			 MedHunters is not responsible for the privacy
			 practices of such employer. </p>
		       <p>We may also use your contact information
			 to send you emails about updates to the MedHunters
			 Site or new features or services offered
			 by MedHunters or our business partners or
			 to contact you about your opinion of current
			 products and services or potential future
			 products and services. At the time of registering,
			 you have the option to decline to receive
			 such information from MedHunters. </p>
		       <p>We reserve the right to send you certain
			 communications relating to MedHunters, such
			 as service announcements, administrative
			 messages, information about specific job
			 opportunities, and the MedHunters weekly
			 newsletter that are considered part of your
			 MedHunters account, without offering you
			 the opportunity to opt out of them.</p>
		       <p>Should you choose to submit feedback to
			 MedHunters, such feedback becomes our property
			 and we can use such feedback (such as job
			 seeker testimonials) for marketing purposes
			 or to contact you for further information.</p>

		       <p>The MedHunters Site contains links to other
			 web sites, including employers, vendors and
			 business partners, over which we have no
