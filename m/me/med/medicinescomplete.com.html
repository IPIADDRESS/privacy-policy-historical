<h2 id="p1">1. Collection of Personal Information from Website Visitors</h2>

<p>Pharmaceutical Press may collect and/or track:</p>
<ol>
 <li>The home server domain names, e-mail addresses, operating
system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Website;</li>
 <li>the e-mail addresses of visitors who communicate with Pharmaceutical Press via e-mail;</li>
 <li>information provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms surveys, and contest entries (including demographic, financial and personal profile data);</li>
 <li>aggregate and user-specific information on which pages visitors access; and</li>
  <li>payment information and financial details about our customers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pharmaceutical Press may place Internet "cookies" on visitors' hard drives. Internet cookies may save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor's name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, and the pages of a site viewed by the visitor. When the visitor revisits the Website, the Website may recognise the visitor by the Internet cookie and customise the visitor's experience accordingly.</p>

<p>Visitors may decline or disable Internet cookies while visiting the Website. However, doing so may affect the Website's functionality.</p>

<p>Visitors also have the right to delete the Internet cookie placed on the visitors' hard drives at any time. Doing so will erase the data about the individual visitor such that when the visitor revisits the Website (in a new session), the Website will not recognise the visitor.</p>

<p>When a visitor performs a search within the Website, Pharmaceutical Press may record information relating to the search request, identifying the visitor and linking the visitor to the search performed. </p>

<h2 id="p2">2. Use of Personal Data Collected</h2>
<p>Personal data collected by Pharmaceutical Press may be used by Pharmaceutical Press for editorial feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis of visitors' behaviour, for product development, for content improvement, to customise the content and layout of the Website, to solve technical problems with the Website service, or to calculate overall usage statistics.</p>

<p>Financial information is used for billing purposes and to fulfil customers' orders. Financial information is held on our secure server with restricted access (see section 5 on Security measures).</p>

<p>Aggregate data (which does not identify individuals) on home server domain names, operating system, and type of web browser may be used for internal purposes.</p>

<p>Individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information, which visitors voluntarily provide to Pharmaceutical Press, may be added to the Pharmaceutical Press databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding website updates, new products and services, upcoming events and the status of orders placed online.</p>

<h2 id="p3">3. Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties</h2>
<p>Pharmaceutical Press does not sell, license, share or intentionally make publicly available any individually identifying information to third parties other than its agents or contractors, such as its software developers, distributors or professional advisers, for the purposes of operating the Website and developing, manufacturing and distributing Pharmaceutical Press products.</p>

<h2 id="p4">4. External Links</h2>
<p>The Website may contain links to other sites. Pharmaceutical Press is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites unless they are owned and operated by Pharmaceutical Press. We encourage our visitors to be aware when they leave the Website and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected through or in connection with the Website.</p>

<h2 id="p5">5. Security Measures</h2>
<p>Pharmaceutical Press has implemented security features to prevent the unauthorised release of or access to visitors' personal information. In particular, when a visitor places an order for Publications available on the Website via email, a secure server is used to store all order and payment information securely. Please be advised, however, that while Pharmaceutical Press has endeavoured to create a completely secure Website, the Internet is not a 100% secure medium for the communication of information and Pharmaceutical Press is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.  Accordingly, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from Pharmaceutical Press via Website or e-mail cannot be guaranteed.  </p>

<p>All of our visitors' personal information, not just the financial information described above, is made available only to those employees or contractors who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our finance department and sales or customer service representatives, distributors or software developers).</p>

<h2 id="p6">6. Opt-Out Right</h2>
<p>Visitors may opt out of having their personal information used by Pharmaceutical Press for marketing and promotional purposes, by contacting either the sales or customer services departments of Pharmaceutical Press via post, e-mail or telephone at the addresses posted at the links in section 10, or by unchecking the appropriate box while the visitor accesses his or her account through the Website.</p>

<h2 id="p7">7. Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data</h2>
<p>Upon request via post or e-mail Pharmaceutical Press will provide to visitors any personal information stored by Pharmaceutical Press regarding the visitor.(Pharmaceutical Press reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee for fulfilling such requests). Visitors may correct or update their personal record or cause their personal record to be removed from the Pharmaceutical Press database. Please note that Pharmaceutical Press will only send personal records to the e-mail address on file for the visitor name associated with it.</p>

<h2 id="p8">8. Our Right to Contact the Visitor</h2>
<p>Pharmaceutical Press reserves the right to contact Website visitors regarding their account status and changes to the subscriber agreement, this Privacy Policy, or any other policies or agreements relevant to Website visitors.</p>
