<b>MediaOcean Privacy Policy</b><br>
this policy applies to sites that have URLs (for example, www.______) that end in MediaOcean.com. When we talk about "MediaOcean" or "we" in this policy, we are talking about MediaOcean Company . 
<br><br>
  
 
<p>  <b>Privacy Policy </b>   <br>
  
As an Internet pioneer, we understand the power that the Internet holds for changing your life and making things easier for you. These benefits are at risk if people are concerned about their personal privacy. We are committed to providing you with an Internet experience that respects and protects your personal privacy choices and concerns. 

Our privacy policy and practices are detailed below. Please read them thoroughly. We make three pledges to you: 
We will not release personally identifiable information about you without your permission (except as needed to provide to you the services you have expressly requested). See "third party relationships" below. 
You can manage and control the information that you have voluntarily provided to us. 
You can tell us what your privacy questions and concerns are so that we can respond.
We constantly improve the tools you can use to manage the data that you provide to us. Please refer to this page from time to time to see these new features.
</p>
    
 
<p>  <b>Helpful Definitions </b><br>  
  
Personally identifiable information is information, like your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address, that can be used to uniquely identify you.<br><br>

We will not share any anonymous information about the use of our site with third parties if we know that this information will be linked with your personally identifiable information obtained from another sourse, unless you have given us permission.<br><br>

Anonymous information is not personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information about how you use our site (such as sites you visit and searches you do). Anonymous information also includes the domain names and/or I.P. addresses (as explained below) of internet browsers that visit our site, the time of day the site was visited, and other non-personal information. Anonymous information is information that is not tied to any person who is not registered as an MediaOcean member, but helps us know who what our users do (for example, the average stay on the News page lasts over 10 minutes). <br><br></p>

The next sections tell how and when we collect anonymous information and personally identifiable information from you.

    
 
<p><b>  Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information  </b></p> 
  

<p><b>Registration</b><br>

We want to assure you that you can visit our site and use many of our services without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself to us. It is only when you register to become an MediaOcean member that will you be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information.

 </p>
 <p> <b>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties</b> <br>  
  
We will not share your personally identifiable information unless you have authorized us to share it. 
    </p>
 
<p> <b> Anonymous Information   </b><br>
  
We collect anonymous information when people use our site, even if they have not registered with us. We use this information to personalize your experience on our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages, and to improve our services in general. We share this anonymous information with some other companies, so you can see more relevant advertising messages. These companies analyzes anonymous information that we collect during your visit to MediaOcean and other sites to understand what services you would like.

</p>
    
 
  
<p>  <b>Use of IP Addresses </b> <br> 
  
An Internet protocol (I.P.) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your company's local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers, the powerful computers that provide web pages for viewing, automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online. 

We may collect I.P. addresses for some purposes (for example, to report anonymous user information to our advertisers and to audit the use of our site). We do not ordinarily link a user's I.P. address to a person's personal information, which means we will have a record of each user's session but the user remains anonymous to us. We will use I.P. addresses to identify users of our site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site's terms of use or to protect our service, site, or other users. 

PLEASE NOTE: Under certain circumstances, I.P. addresses and/or domain names may be linked to personally identifiable information, when said information is stored in databases managed by Internet registrars or registries such as Network Solutions or ARIN.</p>
    
 
 
<p>  <b>Security</b>   <br>
  
We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. 

Only certain employees have access to the information you provide us. For example, we impose strict rules on our employees who have access either to the databases that store user information or to the servers that host our services. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
