                  when you are within the Medem-powered environment and only to
                  information that Medem collects. (<a href="http://www.medem.com/node/1113">Click here</a> for more
                  details on the scope of this policy.) Please be advised that
                  individual medical practices with Medem-powered Web sites are
                  the legal owners of those Medem-powered sites and can
                  customize their sites in two ways that fall outside the scope
                  of the Medem Privacy and Confidentiality Policy:
                  <blockquote>A medical practice could put a link on its site
                    that takes you to a site or service that is not part of the
                    Medem-powered environment. Once there, you will no longer be
                    interacting with a Medem server, and you should no longer
                    see any Medem trademarks or legends that refer to Medem. If
                    you leave the Medem-powered environment in this way, you can
                    no longer be assured that the operator of the other site or
                    service will follow the privacy policies and information
                    security practices that are described in the Medem policy.
                    We generally strive to provide buffer pages to inform you
                    when you are leaving our environment, but we cannot monitor
                    all site customizations made by individual medical
                    practices.
                    <p>Within borders bearing a Medem trademark, a practice
                    might publish online forms that ask you to provide
                    information, which is then sent directly to the practice via
                    e-mail (instead of sending it to a database on a Medem
                    server). The most common example would be a practice
                    conducting an online survey or questionnaire among visitors
                    to its site. Medem has no control over information collected
                    in this manner and we cannot be responsible for the security
                    or privacy of that information. </p>
                    <p>If you ever have reason to believe that a medical
                    practice has used its Medem-powered Web site to obtain
                    information that it has used inappropriately, please contact
