<h5>No Information Collected from Children</h5>
<p class="black">We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children. MediaWhiz will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of eighteen (18) years old. If MediaWhiz obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of eighteen (18) years old, that information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, MediaWhiz has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. MediaWhiz has designed this policy in order to comply with the Childrenâs Privacy Protection Act (âCOPPAâ).</p>
<p class="black">&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Security</h5>
<p class="black">All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. We take precautions to protect PII both online and off-line. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. All of our usersâ information, not just PII, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to PII. Furthermore, access to this information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information. Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="black">Please note that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software supporting the Website or other websites under the control of MediaWhiz constitutes a crime punishable by law. We will turn over to authorities, any and all evidence relating to a potential breach of security or other abuse against the network, servers, databases or other such supporting equipment or software. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your PII. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
