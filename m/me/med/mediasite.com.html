<h3>Information Sharing</h3>

<p>In its sole discretion, Sonic Foundry may sell or trade your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties, including successors in interest. If you do not want your information used in this manner, you may contact Sonic Foundry and "opt out" of receiving future marketing information about other products, services, and offerings from Sonic Foundry and/or any third parties. </p>

 

<p>However, even if you opt out of receiving any communications from Sonic Foundry, we reserve the right sell your information to a successor in interest or a purchaser of our assets.

<a name="robots"></a><h3> How do I prevent my Mediasite content from being indexed by Mediasite.com and other search engines? </h3>

<p>The mediasite.com search engine (MiteBot) obeys the <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html" target="_offsite">Robot Exclusion Standard</a>.  MiteBot will obey all entries in the robots.txt file located at a website's root directory with a User-agent containing "MiteBot" or "*".
