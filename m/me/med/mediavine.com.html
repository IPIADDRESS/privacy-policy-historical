Mediavine and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">privacy@mediavine.com</span>.</p>
<p>If Mediavine intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>

The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Sites, the number of visitors to each page of our Sites, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p>
