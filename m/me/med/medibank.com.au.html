                                <p><b>Do we disclose your personal information overseas?</b></p>
                                <p>We may need to disclose your personal information to organisations located outside of Australia from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.  Most of these overseas organisations are services providers or related entities which provide support and assistance to us in delivering our products and services to you.</p>
                                <p>Where we do, we take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is given the same type of protection as it is afforded within Australia. This may be through satisfying ourselves that the overseas organisation has controls in place to comply with Australian privacy laws, ensuring that the overseas organisation is located in a country which we believe has a similar privacy regime to Australia or through contractually or otherwise mandating the adequate management of the information.</p>
                                <p>On occasion, we may also disclose your personal information to overseas organisations where you instruct us or expressly consent to us doing so. In such cases, we may not take the above steps in relation to the management of your information.</p>
                                <p>If you have a corporate health insurance product, there may be occasions where we are instructed by your employer to disclose your information to an overseas organisation in order to administer your policy. In such instances, we may not be able to take reasonable steps to ensure that your information will be afforded the same protection as in Australia and you may not be able to seek redress for how your information is handled under Australian privacy law.</p>
                                <p>Please see the section at the end of this policy which outlines the main countries to which personal information may be disclosed.</p>

                                <p><b>You can access or correct your personal information.  How do you contact us to do so?</b></p>
                                <p>We will generally provide you with access to your personal information if practicable (although an administration fee may be charged), and will take reasonable steps to amend any personal information about you which is inaccurate or out of date.</p>
                                <p>You can get in touch with us at Medibank or at ahm to request the above any time you wish to do so.</p>
                                <p>In some circumstances, we may not permit access to your personal information, or may refuse to correct your personal information.  Where this happens, we will provide you with reasons for this decision, seek alternatives and take any further legally required steps.</p>

                                <p><b>Do you have any concerns over the way we have collected, used or disclosed your personal information?</b></p>

                                <p>If you wish to make a formal complaint, please provide your complaint in writing to our Privacy Officer.  We will consider your complaint promptly and contact you to seek to resolve the matter.</p>
                                <p>Generally, we will contact you to acknowledge receipt of your complaint and let you know who is managing your query within 5 business days. We will attend promptly to your complaint and will aim to respond to your concerns or otherwise keep you informed of our progress within 30 days.</p>
                                <p>If we have not responded to you within a reasonable time or if your complaint is not resolved to your satisfaction, you are entitled under the Privacy Act to make a complaint to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</p>
