                <p>As indicated above, these companies may collect and use your personal (including sensitive) information to provide these services to you including to:</p>

                    <li>resolve any legal and/or commercial complaints or issues; and</li>
                    <li>perform any of their other functions or activities.</li>

                <p>Our subsidiaries may collect your personal (including sensitive) information directly from Medibank and/or other Medibank subsidiaries, you or a person authorised by or responsible for you.</p>
                <p>If you use health related services, our subsidiaries will disclose your personal (including sensitive) information to Medibank in order for us to pay benefits for health related services and to review, develop and improve the services. In order to perform the above functions, our subsidiaries may disclose your personal (including sensitive) information to us, each other and to third parties such as their agents, service providers and professional advisors, health service providers, persons authorised by or responsible for you, and to other parties to whom they are authorised or required by law to disclose information including government agencies, and these parties may collect that information.</p>
                <p>In addition to the collections, uses and disclosures described above, our subsidiaries may also disclose your personal (including sensitive) information to us and each other in order for us and them to assess from what other services you may benefit and to facilitate the provision of such services. We may also disclose your personal (including sensitive) information to our subsidiaries so the Medibank Group may have an integrated view of our members and provide you a better and personalised service. Our subsidiaries may use your personal (including sensitive) information to contact you (including by telephone call, text message or email) in relation to their services. You may withdraw your consent to these specific collections, uses and disclosures at any time by calling us on 132 331, visiting one of our stores, or accessing the <a href="https://secure.medibank.com.au/sml/ManageMyPreferences.aspx">Manage My Preferences</a> page within the Online Member Services facility.</p>

                <p><b>How do we manage the data quality and security of your personal information?</b></p>
                
                <p>To the extent required by the Privacy Act, Medibank will take reasonable steps to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>make sure that the personal information that we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up to date;</li>
                    <li>protect the personal information that we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure; and</li>
                    <li>where permitted by law, destroy or permanently de-identify personal information that is no longer needed for any purpose that is permitted by the Privacy Act.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Anonymity</b></p>
                <p>Medibank will generally provide individuals with the option of not identifying themselves when entering transactions when it is lawful and practicable to do so. However, on many occasions we will not be able to do this. For example, we will need your name and address in order to provide you with private health insurance coverage.</p>
                
                <p><b>Use of Commonwealth Government identifiers</b></p>
                <p>Medibank will not use Commonwealth government identifiers, such as Medicare numbers, as its own identifier of individuals. We will only use or disclose such identifiers in the circumstances permitted by the Privacy Act.</p>
                <p><b>Transfer of personal information overseas</b></p>
                <p>If Medibank transfers your personal information outside Australia, we will comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act that relate to transborder data flows.</p>
                <p><b>Access to your information and contacting us</b></p>
                <p>Medibank will allow you to access and correct personal information it holds about you as required by law. If you have any queries about how Medibank handles your personal information, or would like to request access to or to correct that information, please write to: Privacy Officer, Medibank Private Limited, 16/700 Collins Street, Docklands, Victoria 3008 or privacy@medibank.com.au.</p>
                <p>In some circumstances, Medibank may not permit you access to your personal information, or may refuse to correct your personal information, in which case we will provide you reasons for this decision.</p>
                <p><b>Application of the Medibank Group's Privacy Policies</b></p>
                <p>If you are the person responsible for the management of your private health insurance membership, you must ensure any spouse/partner and dependant children are aware of and consent to how their personal (including sensitive) information is handled under this Privacy Policy. You and your spouse/partner and dependant children (if any) should not provide us with any personal (including sensitive) information unless you and they consent to it being handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
