      When we disclose information to other persons and companies to perform 
      services for us, we will require them to protect your privacy. There are 
      other laws we will follow that provide additional protections, such as 
      laws related to mental health, alcohol and other substance abuse, and

      <p><font size="2">This Notice covers the following sites and people: all

      <p><font size="2"><strong>HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE HEALTH 
      INFORMATION<br>Treatment:</strong> We may use and disclose your health 
      information to provide treatment or services, to coordinate or manage your 
      health care, or for medical consultations or referrals. We may disclose 
      your health information to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students 
      and other personnel who are involved in taking care of you. We may share 
      information about you to coordinate the different services you need, such 
      as prescriptions, lab work and x-rays. We may disclose information about 
      you to people outside our facility who may be involved in your care after 
      you leave, such as family members, home health agencies, therapists, 
      nursing homes, clergy, and others. We may give information to your health 
      plan or another provider to arrange a referral or consultation.</font> 
</p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Payment:</strong> We may use and disclose your 
      health information so that we can receive payment for the treatment and 
      services that were provided. We may share this information with your 
      insurance company or a third party used to process billing information. We 
      may contact your insurance company to verify what benefits you are 
      eligible for, to obtain prior authorization, and to tell them about your 
      treatment to make sure that they will pay for your care. We may disclose 
      information to third parties who may be responsible for payment, such as 
      family members, or to bill you. We may disclose information to third 
      parties that help us process payments, such as billing companies, claims 
      processing companies, and collection companies.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Healthcare Operations:</strong> We may use and 
      disclose your health information as necessary to operate our facility and 
      make sure that all of our patients receive quality care. We may use health 
      information to evaluate the quality of services that you received, or the 
      performance of our staff in caring for you. We may use health information 
      to improve our performance or to find better ways to provide care. We may 
      use health information to grant medical staff privileges or to evaluate 
      the competence of our health care professionals. We may use your health 
      information to decide what additional services we should offer and whether 
      new treatments are effective. We may disclose information to students and 
      professionals for review and learning purposes. We may combine our health 
      information with information from other health care facilities to compare 
      how we are doing and see where we can make improvements. We may use health 
      information for business planning, or disclose it to attorneys, 
      accountants, consultants and others in order to make sure we are complying 
      with the law. We may remove health information that identifies you so that 
      others may use the de-identified information to study health care and 
      health care delivery without learning who you are.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Appointment Reminders and Service 
      Information:</strong> We may use or disclose your health information to 
      contact you to provide appointment reminders, or to let you know about 
      treatment alternatives or other health related services or benefits that 
      may be of interest to you.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Patient Directories:</strong> We may keep your 
      name, location in the facility, and your general condition in a directory 
      to give to anyone who asks for you by name. We may give this information 
      and your religious affiliation to clergy, even if they do not know your 
      name. You may ask us to keep your information out of the directory, but 
      you should know that if you do, visitors and florists will not be able to 
      find your room.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Individuals Involved In Your Care:</strong> We may 
      give your health information to people involved in your care, such as 
      family members or friends, unless you ask us not to. We may give your
