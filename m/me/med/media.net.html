<h3>How we user your information</h3>

If a change in ownership occurs that will result in your personal information being used in a manner different from that   stated in the then-existing privacy policy, notification will be provided consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy. </p>
            <p> Third parties for legal process: In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request   for cooperation from any law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive   any legal objection or right available to us in our sole discretion. In addition, we may disclose your information when we believe it is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce the terms of   service of our Website or other agreements or policies. </p>
            <p> Aggregated and Non-Personal Information: We may rent, sell, or share aggregated demographic information not specifically identifiable to you, and other non-personal information we collect, with any third parties for any reason, including to develop and deliver targeted advertising, and to conduct general business analysis.
