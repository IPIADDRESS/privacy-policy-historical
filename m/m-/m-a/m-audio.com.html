<h3><a name="_TYPES_OF_INFORMATION">TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</a></h3>
<h4>Information You Provide To Us</h4>
<p>We collect information you voluntarily provide to us.&nbsp; For example, certain portions of our sites may require that you submit personal information, such as your name and email address, before using those portions of the site.&nbsp; You are also required to register with our sites and provide your name or email address before using any of the “members only” areas of our sites. For some services, such as forums, blogs, customer support features, registering products, for events or contests, downloading software or uploading content, you may have to create an account and submit additional personal information such as your mailing address.</p>
<p>Some of our websites allow you to purchase hardware and/or software products. If you choose to make a purchase, you must provide certain payment information, including your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to our website a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number. <strong>We do not store your payment information</strong>. We store your shipping address to fulfill your order. Note that third-party payment processors may retain this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Information Collected Automatically</h4>
<p>You may visit our sites while remaining anonymous and not reveal any personal information.&nbsp; However, our apps and websites use <a href="#_OUR_USE_OF">cookies and similar technologies</a> to automatically log your IP address and domain name, and non-personal information such as the type of device you use to access our websites, the operating system and version, your general geographic location as indicated by your IP address, your browser type, the webpages you view on our websites, and whether and how you interact with content available on our websites.&nbsp; This information helps us administer the sites and to compile statistics such as the number of visitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Information Obtained From Other Sources</h4>
<p>On occasion, inMusic may offer in conjunction with third parties, such as software partners, app partners, music sharing services and other co-promoted-brand partners, certain products or services that may require you to share your personal information with that third party as a condition for receiving that product or service. In such circumstances, we may receive information about you.&nbsp; We may also receive information about you from social media platforms and third-party media hosting sites when you interact with any of our brands on such platforms.&nbsp; While inMusic treats any such information it receives from third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applies any additional restrictions required by such third parties, inMusic is not responsible for the information submitted by you to that third party.&nbsp; You should review the applicable rules and any third party’s applicable privacy policies separately before participating in such product or service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Information Of Children</h4>
<p>While not intended for, nor targeted to children, some of inMusic’s applications and websites may appeal to children under the age of eighteen.&nbsp; We do not knowingly request or collect data from children under eighteen unless we have the consent of a parent or guardian. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites their children visit.&nbsp; If a parent or guardian notifies us or we otherwise learn that a child under eighteen has improperly registered or submitted information, we will immediately cancel the child’s account and delete all personal information of that child from our records.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><a name="_OUR_BASES_FOR">OUR BASES FOR USING YOUR INFORMATION</a></h3>
<p>We rely on certain legal bases to use your personal information.&nbsp; Specifically:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Your Consent</h4>
<p>We may use your personal information when you explicitly and clearly tell us we can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Performance of a contract</h4>
<p>The use of your personal information may be necessary to perform the agreement you have with us.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Legitimate interests</h4>
<p>We may use your personal information for our legitimate interests. For example, we rely on our legitimate interest to analyze and improve our products and services and the content on our websites and app, to send you notifications about software updates or information about our products and services or to use your personal information for administrative, fraud detection or legal purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="_SECURITY,_STORAGE_AND">SECURITY, STORAGE AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION</a></h3>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>While inMusic is committed to protecting the security of your information, no security system is perfect.&nbsp; inMusic employs a variety of reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures and industry standards to protect against the loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction of the information under our control. Since our sites under general usage do not collect financial information, inMusic uses the standard internet connections for those general usage portions of the site, without secured sockets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases, you may be prompted to register with our sites to undertake a particular site activity or obtain a particular service. As part of that registration, you may be asked to choose your own password. inMusic reminds you to protect your password, and not provide it to others to use. Allowing others to access and use your account and password can compromise the security of your information. inMusic disclaims any responsibility or obligation for your decision to provide your password to others. Please alert us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. Additionally, always log out and close your browser when you finish your session. <strong>Please note, we will never ask you to disclose your password.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Storage</h4>
<p>Personal data collected by inMusic may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, or in any other country where inMusic or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers are located or maintain facilities. inMusic has put in place adequate mechanisms to protect personal information when it is transferred internationally, for example by using the Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Retention</h4>
<p>inMusic will retain your personal information for as long as we deem it necessary to enable you to use the website and your product(s), to provide services to you, to comply with applicable laws (including those regarding document retention), resolve disputes with any parties and otherwise as necessary to allow us to conduct our business. All personal information we retain will be subject to this Privacy Policy and our internal retention guidelines. If you have a question about a specific retention period for certain types of personal information we process about you, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@inmusicbrands.com">privacy@inmusicbrands.com</a>.</p>

These partners use these technologies to (1) help us analyze how you use the inMusic websites, such as by noting the third-party services from which you arrived, (2) market and advertise inMusic products and services to you on the inMusic websites and third-party websites, (3) help us detect or prevent fraud or conduct risk assessments, or (4) collect information about your activities on the inMusic websites, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on. For example, to help us better understand how people use the inMusic websites, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser by <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>Targeting and advertising cookies we use may include Google, and other advertising networks and services we use from time to time. For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page</a>, the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page</a>, or <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/">http://youronlinechoices.eu</a>. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings</a> page. To the extent advertising technology is integrated into the inMusic websites and you opt-out of tailored advertising, you may still receive advertising content. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of these opt-out links and are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Social Plugins</strong></p>
<p>The inMusic websites may use social plugins provided and operated by third parties, such as Facebook’s Like Button. As a result of this, you may send to the third party the information that you are viewing on a certain part of the inMusic websites. If you are not logged into your account with the third party, then the third party may not know your identity. If you are logged in to your account with the third party, then the third party may be able to link information or actions about your interactions with the inMusic websites to your account with them. Please refer to the third party’s privacy policies to learn more about its data practices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="_OUR_INTERNATIONAL_OPERATIONS">OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS</a></h3>
<p>We operate internationally and transfer information to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy.</p>
<p>The United States, European Economic Area (“EEA”) Member States, and other countries all have different laws. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live. For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country. In particular, if your information is in the US, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with US law.</p>
<p>To the extent that inMusic is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Model Clauses</strong></p>
<p>The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside of Europe. We often use these Model Clauses when transferring personal information outside of Europe. You can request a copy of our Model Clauses by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@inmusicbrands.com">privacy@inmusicbrands.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Shield</strong></p>
<p>inMusic does not participate in Privacy Shield at this time. However, inMusic Europe may rely on the EU-US Privacy Shield to transfer personal information to some of our third-party service providers in the United States, where they are certified to receive such information under the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">Privacy Shield Program</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Necessary for the performance of the contract</strong></p>
<p>inMusic provides a voluntary service; you can choose whether or not you want to use the services. However, if you want to use the services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between inMusic and its members. As we operate in countries worldwide (including in the US) and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the services to you, in accordance with the contract between us, we need to transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the services. Simply put, we cannot provide you with the services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information around the world.</p>
<h3><a name="_CHANGES_TO_THIS">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</a></h3>
<p>If and when inMusic makes changes to this site, inMusic may have to update this Privacy Policy to better reflect those changes. When we update it, we will change the “Last Update” date at the top of this page.&nbsp; Because changes to our sites or updates to this Privacy Policy may occur, you should review this Privacy Policy from time to time. Remember, your decision to continue using our sites after this Privacy Policy Statement is updated will signify that you have agreed to any new terms.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@inmusicbrands.com">privacy@inmusicbrands.com</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, inMusic Brands, Inc. is a data controller for personal data we collect subject to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Our address is 200 Scenic View Dr., Cumberland, RI 02864 U.S.A.</p>
