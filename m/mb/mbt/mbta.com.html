</b>We collect <u>no</u> Personal Identifiable Information about you <u>unless</u> you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (i.e. sending an e-mail, participating in a survey, filling out a form, applying for employment on line or purchasing a pass, etc.). If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way effect your ability to use any other feature of the MBTA web site. <br>

<b><u></u></b><u></u><p><u><b><a name="what_is"></a>What is "Personally Identifiable Information"? </b></u><br>
<br>
We use the term "personally identifiable information" to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, Social Security number, birth date, bank account information, credit card information, or any combination of information that could be used to identify you. <br>
<a href="#table_of_contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<b><u></u></b><u></u><p><u><b><a name="dissemination_of"></a>Dissemination of Your Personally Identifiable Information</b> </u><br>
<br>
We do not sell, trade or rent any personally identifiable information collected through this Web site. However, once you voluntarily submit personally identifiable information to us through an e-mail, its dissemination is governed by the <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/legis/laws/mgl/66-10.htm">Public Records Law</a>, the <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/legis/laws/mgl/gl-66A-toc.htm">Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 66A (Fair Information Practices Act) </a>, <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/consumer/New/privexeco.htm">Executive Order 412</a>, and other applicable laws and regulations. For this reason, part or all of the information you send us may be provided to a member of the public in response to a public records request.  However, financial information associated with your "MBTA Shop On Line" activities, such as credit information, will not be disclosed in response to a public records request.</p>
<p>In addition, the information that you voluntarily submit will be disclosed only to MBTA employees or officials with a "need to know" for purposes of fulfilling their job responsibilities. They will only use the information to answer your questions, respond to any requests for assistance, and fulfill the MBTA â€™s legal obligations. Where appropriate, we may provide the information submitted by you to the person or company that is the subject of your inquiry, or to a government agency responsible for the matters referred to in your communication.  Finally, when you request a "Shop On Line" transaction at our site, we will use the information you provide strictly for purposes of completing the transaction you have requested, and will not use this information for any other purposes.  The specifics of our Policy concerning "Shop On Line" transactions may be reviewed below, in the section entitled "Privacy and Security at MBTA Shop On Line."<br>

<b><u></u></b><u></u><p><u><b><a name="security_protections"></a>Security Protections at the MBTA Web Site<br>
</b><br>
</u>The MBTA has taken several steps to safeguard the integrity of its telecommunications and computing infrastructure, including but not limited to authentication, monitoring, auditing, and encryption. Security measures have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day practices of the entire information environment as part of a commitment to quality control.</p>
<p><br>
Because this site does not encrypt incoming e-mail, you should not send information that you consider highly sensitive through this Web site. We use standard security measures to<b> </b>minimize the threat<b><u> </u></b>that your personally identifiable information will be lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed.  We also use software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. </p>
<p>This information should not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information provided by or submitted<b><u> </u></b>to the MBTA web site.<br>

<b><u><p><a name="security_shop_online"></a>Privacy and Security at MBTA Shop On Line </p>
</u></b><p>When you order a monthly pass or ticket through our site, we will collect the following information to properly complete your order: your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, shipping information and credit card information. We use a reputable company to verify your credit card information before billing your account. We will also share your shipping information with the delivery service you request (either the U.S. Postal Service, United Parcel Service, or other delivery companies you select).</p>
<p>Our orders are processed through a secured server using advanced forms of encryption software. This means that all of your personal information including credit card number, name, and address will be encrypted to minimize the possibility that the information (if intercepted) it can be read as it travels over the Internet. Your credit card numbers are processed only by a third party credit card vendor and do not reside on the MBTA servers. <br>
