            <a class="anchor" id="collect"></a>
            <h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND&nbsp;HOW</h2>
            <p>We collect only such Personal Information as necessary to provide our Products or Services to you, inform you about our Products and Services, continue our research in the field, and improve our Site, Products, Services, and your experience interacting with CPP. In some cases, we ask questions to which the response is optional, and these questions are identified as such. You are free not to respond to these optional questions. We describe below the different ways in which we collect or obtain Personal&nbsp;Information.</p>
            <p><strong>If you visit the Site  --</strong>  If you visit the Site, we automatically collect the related Session Data. Session Data is provided to us by your browser and through our log files, which record your activities while browsing our Site, such as when you click on a link. We may record some of this data in one or several <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> that we send to your browser. We also use third-party analytics&nbsp;providers.</p>
            <p><strong>If you register or create an account  --</strong>  If you register or create an account, we require that you fill out a form to register as a purchaser or Customer (as applicable). We collect your name, contact information, and other information, and may ask you for other optional information that helps us serve you&nbsp;better.</p>
            <p>If a potential Test Administrator creates an account, we collect additional information about the person’s practice, credentials, and education, as necessary to assess the qualifications of the applicant to purchase Assessment&nbsp;services.</p>
            <p><strong>If you purchase a Product or Service  --</strong>  If you purchase a Product or Service, we collect your contact information as necessary to fulfill the order (such as name, address, shipping information, email address, or telephone number) and optional information if you provide&nbsp;it.</p>
            <p>If you purchase a Product or Service for delivery to, or use by, another person, we collect your Personal Information as the person initiating the purchase, and Personal Information about that other person (such as name, shipping address, telephone number or email address) as necessary to fulfill the order. By providing another person’s Personal Information, you represent that you have that person’s permission to do&nbsp;so.</p>
            <p><strong>If you pay for a Product or Service --</strong>  When you make a purchase online, we do not collect payment information ourselves. Instead, you are redirected to our payment processor’s website, which collects directly your payment information. CPP only receives a notice of the receipt of the payment, a confirmation number (for verification purposes), the name and contact information of the recipient of the Product or Service, and the name and contact information of the cardholder if different from the name of the person receiving the Product or&nbsp;Service.</p>
            <p>If we take an order over the phone or by fax, we collect the payment information directly from the person placing the order, transfer it to the payment card processor, and, after receiving confirmation of the payment from the payment card processor, we retain this payment information in a secured location, with restricted access, and in accordance with our internal record retention&nbsp;policy.</p>
            <p><strong>If you complete an Assessment  --</strong>  If an Assessment Taker completes an Assessment at the direction of a Customer (e.g., an employer, a Test Administrator, etc.), whether online or offline, we collect the Assessment Taker’s unique identifier and in some cases, the Assessment Taker’s gender. The Assessment Taker also has the option to provide demographic information such as highest level of education attained or occupation. We collect the responses provided to the questions in the Assessment. In this case, we do not know the identity of the Assessment Taker. We only know the identity of the Test Administrator, and the unique identifier that has been assigned by the Test&nbsp;Administrator.</p>
            <p>If an Assessment Taker completes an Assessment on his own initiative (i.e., outside the scope of a relationship with a Customer), using our online service, we collect the Assessment Taker’s contact information, and in some cases, gender. The Assessment Taker also has the option to provide demographic information such as highest level of education attained or occupation. We collect the response provided to the questions in the Assessment. In this case, we know the identity of the Test Taker and that of the person who paid for the Assessment, if&nbsp;applicable.</p>
            <p><strong>If you participate in a survey  --</strong> If you choose to participate in one of our surveys, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address (to avoid duplicate responses), as well as any other Personal Information that you may provide in your survey responses. The responses from survey participants are compiled in an anonymized&nbsp;format.</p>
            <p><strong>If you sign up to receive a CPP newsletter  --</strong> If you sign up to receive a CPP newsletter, we may collect information on the open rate of the newsletter, and whether a specific individual has clicked on a link contained in a particular issue of our&nbsp;newsletter.</p>
            <p><strong>If you are a Customer or other business contact  --</strong>  If you are a Customer or other business contact, or if you are an employee or agent of a Customer or business contact, we may collect your email address, telephone, contact information, and correspondence in the regular course of our interaction with&nbsp;you.</p>
            <p><strong>If you participate in our blogs or forums, or if you write to us  --</strong>  We may collect the Personal Information that you provide in your correspondence and communications with us, or through your participation in surveys, blogs, and&nbsp;forums.</p>
            <p><strong>If you interact with third parties regarding our Products or Services  --</strong>  We may receive Personal Information about you from third parties, such as from Customers, CPP distributors, Test Administrators, Test Administrators’ employers, websites where we advertise, business partners, and service providers. Some of this information pertains to a specific individual; other information can only be linked to an access point or a&nbsp;device.</p>
            <p><strong>If you become certified or qualified in our Products or Services  --</strong>  If you become certified or otherwise qualified in one or more of our Products or Services, we collect information regarding the details of your certification or qualification, such as your name, the instruments in which you are certified/qualified, the date of your certification/qualification, and the current status of your&nbsp;certification/qualification.</p>
            <a class="anchor" id="personal"></a>
            <h2>HOW WE USE PERSONAL&nbsp;INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>We use Personal Information in order to provide and enhance the Products or Services that we offer as explained&nbsp;below:</p>
            <p><strong>To facilitate the use of the Site  --</strong>  We use the Session Data to ease navigation throughout the Site, to enhance navigation, such as to determine the language of the country where the visitor is located, keep track of the shopping cart or keep track of login name and password in order to avoid requesting identity information when the visitor moves from page to page, and in general to enhance the quality of our Site and the content provided on the&nbsp;Site.</p>
            <p><strong>In connection with Assessments  --</strong>  We use the responses to an Assessment to score the Assessment and prepare the related Report about the Assessment Taker. The Report is delivered to our Customer. We retain a copy of your responses and the related Report in accordance with our record retention&nbsp;policy.</p>
            <p><strong>To provide our Products and Services --</strong>  The Personal Information collected from purchase order forms is used to send orders to our Customers. The limited payment information that we receive from our payment processors is used to verify that a Product or Service has been paid&nbsp;for.</p>
            <p><strong>For research purposes  --</strong>  We may use aggregated Session Data to better understand how our Site is navigated, how many visitors arrive at specific pages, which pages or content attract more viewers, the length and frequency of stays at our Site, the different types of searches of our Site content and databases, the types of browsers and computer operating systems that our visitors use, and the IP addresses from which visitors connect to our Site, in order to improve our Site and enhance our&nbsp;content.</p>

            <h2>TO WHOM WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL&nbsp;INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>From time to time, we may disclose Personal Information to someone other than the individual who provided this information, as&nbsp;follows:</p>
            <p><strong>Assessments Reports  --</strong>  CPP provides its Customers with the information that they need to properly counsel or advise their clients, customers, and employees, as applicable. If you are taking an Assessment at the direction of one of our Customers, that Customer will receive from CPP a Report on the Assessment that you took, so that he or she may properly counsel or advise you or provide you with other&nbsp;services.</p>
            <p><strong>The Public  --</strong>  If you are or become certified or qualified as a Test Administrator for our Products and Services,  we may share information regarding your certification, such as your name, the instruments in which you are certified/qualified, the date of your certification/qualification, its scope, and the current status of your certification/qualification with the public, and you hereby authorize us to do&nbsp;so.</p>
            <p><strong>Foreign Distributors  --</strong>  CPP may provide its distributors in foreign markets with a list of Customers (including name and contact information) or prospective Customers residing in that distributor’s CPP-approved area of distribution. CPP will do so only when it reasonably believes that providing such information will permit to improve the service to CPP Customers or prospective Customers in that distributor’s area, and only when the distributor’s use of such information is in accordance with CPP’s privacy policies in&nbsp;general.</p>
            <p><strong>CPP Sites  --</strong>  We may combine the information that we collect from different <a href="#site">CPP Sites</a> to supplement an individual’s profile, for example to combine the records of different purchases or different activities made or conducted from different CPP&nbsp;Sites.</p>
            <p><strong>Public Forums  --</strong>  The Sites <a href="http://www.cppiconsuccess.com" target="_blank">www.cppiconsuccess.com</a> and <a href="http://www.mbtitalk.com" target="_blank">www.mbtitalk.com</a> offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. any personal information that you provide on these blogs or forums may be read, collected, and used by others who access&nbsp;them.</p>
            <p><strong>Service providers  --</strong>  We may engage certain third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, customer relationship management, contract management, shipment, order fulfillment, payment credit card processing, mass mailing, hosting and maintenance, database storage and management, business analytics, fraud prevention, and direct marketing campaign service providers. For example, If during the creation of your account, you affirmatively indicate to us that you are exempt from taxes, we share your email address with our service provider who will email you a link describing how you can use their service to verify your tax-exempt&nbsp;status.</p>
            <p>Pursuant to written agreements between CPP and these service providers, each of these service providers only has access to such Personal Information as necessary to fulfill its obligation to CPP, is not permitted to use Personal Information for any purposes other than those directed by CPP, and is required to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this&nbsp;Policy.</p>
            <p>Certain of CPP’s service providers may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use CPP&nbsp;Sites.</p>
            <p><strong>To defend or enforce our rights  --</strong>  CPP may use Personal Information to protect itself or to protect the Site, to respond to a breach of its Terms and Conditions, to prevent fraudulent activity, or where it is necessary to pursue available remedies.  If a Customer neglects to pay amounts due and owing to CPP, CPP may send that CPP customer’s name, contact information, and account information to a third-party service provider for collection of overdue&nbsp;payments.</p>
            <p><strong>Co-marketing  --</strong>  We may collaborate with other companies to offer you additional Products or Services (e.g., book publishers). We will share Personal Information that is necessary for these other companies to provide the Products or Services that you have requested. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of your Personal Information by these companies. We encourage you to read a company’s privacy policy before requesting any of its Products or&nbsp;Services.</p>
            <p><strong>Mergers &amp; Acquisition; Bankruptcy  --</strong>  If any or all of the CPP assets are acquired by, or merged with those of another entity, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we may disclose, share or transfer some or all of our users’ personal information to or with this entity in preparation of the transaction, as part of the due diligence, or after the transaction has been consummated, so that the successor entity can continue providing our services to our users. If the recipient of the personal information has personal information practices that do not meet the substance of this Privacy Policy, you will be given the opportunity to exercise your rights with respect to your Personal&nbsp;Information.</p>
            <p><strong>Law Enforcement; Litigation  --</strong>  Certain federal, state, local, or other government regulations may require that we disclose information that we hold. In such cases, we will use reasonable efforts to disclose only the Personal Information required under applicable law, such as in response to a facially valid court order, warrant or subpoena issued or made by a court, person or body. We may use or disclose Personal Information (a) if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it; or (b) to a person who needs the information because of an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an identified group or&nbsp;person.</p>
            <p><strong>Aggregated data  --</strong>  Other than as stated above, if CPP provides a third-party with Personal Information, it will be in the form of aggregated data and used for product development, research, or statistical analysis. Aggregated data are created from records that are stripped of all personal identifiers, such as a combination of thousands of answers to survey questions and instrument responses, or on-site&nbsp;behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Third Parties Tracking Technologies  --</strong>  Our third party advertising partner employs pixel tags that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is&nbsp;effective.</p>
            <p><strong>Do Not Track --</strong> CPP Sites do not respond to “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of Personal Information about online activities over time and across different&nbsp;websites.</p>
            <a class="anchor" id="retain"></a>
            <h2>HOW WE RETAIN PERSONAL&nbsp;INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>We retain scored item responses and the related Report associated with the user ID or transaction number that our Customer provided us in accordance with our internal record retention policy and for at least two (2) years from the date when an Assessment Taker took an Assessment, unless a Customer directs us otherwise. We retain scored item responses and Reports in an anonymized (e.g., non-personally identifiable) format, for as long as the information is needed for our research, statistical analysis, or product&nbsp;development.</p>
            <a class="anchor" id="protect"></a>
            <h2>HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL&nbsp;INFORMATION</h2>
            <p><strong>Security --</strong> We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect Personal Information, during transmission and once we receive it. We use administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to protect it from any unauthorized access, loss, misuse, disclosure, alteration, or&nbsp;destruction.</p>
            <p>When we need to transfer information out of our firewall, we use industry-standard technological means to protect Personal Information while in transit through the Internet. We use encryption and a comprehensive authentication protocol to provide reasonable&nbsp;security.</p>
            <p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute&nbsp;security.</p>
            <p><strong>Identity Theft --</strong>  Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to us. For more information about protecting yourself from these practices, you may want to visit <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt127.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt127.shtm</a>. Please understand that you also have a responsibility in protecting your information. The only time when a CPP associate may contact you (via electronic communication, postal mail, telephone, etc.) about your credit card or payment information is in connection with a transaction that you have initiated. Otherwise, no one from CPP is permitted to contact anyone to request your credit card information, user ID, password, national identification number, or other identifier or sensitive information in a non-secure or unsolicited email or telephone&nbsp;communication.</p>
