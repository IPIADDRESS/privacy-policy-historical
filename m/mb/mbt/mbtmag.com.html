<p><strong>Section 9. INFORMATION RELATED TO CHILDREN.</strong></p>
<p>(a) The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information (from children under 13 years of age. <strong>The Services are not directed at children under 13 years of age, but we recognize that with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to visit and utilize the Services.</strong> COPPA requires that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of the Services. </p>
<p>(b) When your child attempts to register and/or provide personal information to ABM (including on any of the Services), we require a parent or legal guardian to: complete the registration; review our privacy policy and to submit a valid credit card number to verify that the child’s parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our information practices related to children protected by COPPA; and verify through the use of an email confirmation and second authorization that the parent or guardian consents to any applicable the Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>(c) The information we may collect may include information from which children that may be personally identified include names, postal address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address, buying information (e.g., preferences or history), birth date, birthplace, parents name, gender, geolocation information, zip code, biographical information, personal interests, and Facebook/Twitter/Google/ICQ/AIM/Yahoo/MSN/SKYPE user name (or similar user names), when you register with them, use the particular products or services, or post content on a blog site as a guest with authoring rights, or photos, videos, audio files that may contain children’s image or voice as applicable. </p>
<p>(d) Once parental or guardian notice and consent has been verified, the information we collect will be treated the same as information collected from any other user of the Services. Without verified parental notice and consent, we will not knowingly collect personal information of children under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it, provided that we will not delete the information needed to (i) protect the security or integrity of the Site or Services; (ii) take precautions against liability; (iii) respond to judicial process; or (iv) to the extent permitted under other provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety; and where such information is not be used for any other purpose.</p>
<p>(e) How Parents Can Access their Children’s Personal Information:</p>
<p>(i) In compliance with COPPA, parents and legal guardians may request us to review, delete, or stop the collection of the Personal Data of their child. In order to do so, you may contact us by letter, phone, or email, using the address information provided in Section 11 of this Privacy Policy or on our “Contact Us” page of the Site. </p>
<p>(ii) If you request that no further information about your child be collected or used, we will be required to terminate your child’s ability to use the Services that require a user to “sign in.”</p>
<p>(f) For purposes of this Section 9, persistent identifiers that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different websites or online services, such as a user name is also considered personal information. Where the Site or Services collect a persistent identifier and no other personal information and such identifier is used for the sole purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Site or the Service, no notice will be given.</p>
