        <p><br>
          Whilst exploring the services offered through MBNA's  website, please be aware that other online retailers, partners, third party  internet sites, and third party services accessible through MBNA's website have  separate privacy and data collection policies and practices which are  independent of and may differ from MBNA's policies and practices.

          <li>We use established and exacting  security standards to protect customer information from unauthorised access. </li>
          <li>We verify the identity of our  customers through the use of personal passwords or other information before  assisting them. </li>

MBNA also helps other companies, including e.g. Adobe to execute, optimise, and measure the effectiveness of their advertising programs by allowing them to use cookies or similar technologies on our website.

        <p>MBNA's banner advertisements and online applications may contain small graphics with tags in them. These tags are not personally identifiable and work in conjunction with these cookies. These tags allow us to measure the effectiveness and response rates of our advertising.</p>
