<font size="+1">Your privacy is important to us</font>

<p>At MBNA Canada Bank ("MBNA"), we are committed to providing you with
the finest financial products and services backed by consistently
top-quality service.  And while information about you is fundamental
to our ability to do this, we fully recognize the importance of
keeping personal information secure.

</p><p>To offer you the widest range of products and services, MBNA may share
information about you both within MBNA and outside of MBNA with other
companies.  This allows us to offer you products and services that may
interest you and best meet your needs, whether they are available
directly from MBNA or through our relationships with other companies.
We want you to understand our information safeguards, what information
we collect, what information we share, and the benefits you receive
when we share information about you.

</p><p>This notice describes the privacy practices of MBNA for financial
products and services governed by the laws of Canada.  This notice
also explains MBNA's practices regarding the collection, use and
retention of personal information and lets you choose whether or not
MBNA may share certain information about you, either within MBNA or
outside of MBNA with other companies.

</p><p><b>Security Safeguards</b>

</p><p>MBNA understands the importance of protecting and securing information
and using it appropriately.  Access to information about you is
restricted to the People of MBNA requiring it to provide products or
services to you.  We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural
safeguards in compliance with applicable law.

</p><p>When MBNA shares information about you with a company outside of MBNA,
we require them to impose safeguards, use it only for a permitted
purpose, and to return it to us or destroy it once that purpose is
served.  We limit the amount of information shared to what is
necessary to offer a product or service efficiently.  MBNA requires
any company receiving information from MBNA to sign a Confidentiality
Agreement containing these requirements and obligating the company to
protect the information as we would.

</p><p><b>Information We Collect</b>

</p><p>MBNA collects and uses information about you only to the extent
required to conduct our business and to consistently deliver the
top-quality Customer service you expect from us.  Sources of
information include:

</p><ul>

<li>Information we receive from you on applications and other forms or
through your correspondence or communication with us including through
the mail, by telephone or over the Internet;

</li><li>Information about your transactions with MBNA and with other companies
outside of MBNA; and

</li><li>Information we receive from third parties such as consumer reporting
agencies, to verify statements you've made to us or regarding your
employment, credit or other relationships.

</li></ul>

<p><b>Information We Share within MBNA</b>

</p><p>We may share any of the information we collect about you within MBNA
to offer additional products or services that may interest you and
best meet your needs.  We believe this is more convenient for you and
may save you both time and money.  The decision to purchase any such
products or services is yours alone.  We may partner with other
organizations in offering additional products or services.

</p><p><b>Information We Share With Others</b>

</p><p>We may share all the information we collect with companies that
perform marketing or other services on our behalf, with companies
assisting us in servicing your loan or account, to government entities
in response to subpoenas or regulatory requirements, or to consumer
reporting agencies.

</p><p>From time-to-time, we may also work with companies outside of MBNA to
offer you products and services that we've determined may be of
interest to you including financial service companies such as
insurance providers and non-financial companies such as card registry
services.  In order to ensure that you receive only those offers that
are of greatest interest to you, we may share some or all of the
information we have collected with these third party companies as
outlined in the "security safeguards" section.

</p><p><b>Important Information About Your Choice</b>

</p><p>We disclose information about you only in accordance with law and to
the extent required to conduct our business.  This allows us to offer
you a greater variety of products and services and to consistently
deliver the top-quality service you expect from MNBA, in addition to
saving you time and money.  We fully recognize the importance of
keeping personal information secure.

</p><p>We're dedicated to serving your needs - and your choices related to
privacy.  You may direct MBNA not to share information about you,
either within MBNA or with other companies outside of MBNA (other than
disclosures permitted or required by law).  You may also notify us if
you do not wish to receive any further marketing materials.  However,
if you should withdraw your consent to our use or ability to collect
and report credit information on you to and from consumer reporting
agencies, you do so on the understanding that we may no longer be able
to extend credit to you.  We will continue to report the status of
your account to credit reporting agencies until your account has been
finally settled.  If you wish to opt out of such information sharing,
please write to us at: MBNA Canada, Privacy Office, P.O. Box 9660,
Station T, Ottawa, Ontario K1C 6M9.  We will ask you to verify your
identity and the specific accounts to which the opt out applies.  MBNA
will continue to adhere to the privacy practices described in this
notice even if you become an inactive Customer or if you close your
accounts.

</p><p>Please remember that your choices regarding MBNA's information sharing
practices are maintained by MBNA unless you revoke them in writing.

</p><p><b>Requesting Your Information</b>

</p><p>In accordance with applicable Federal law, upon written request, you
are entitled to be informed of the existence, use and disclosure of
your personal information.  To make such a request, please write to us
at address noted above.  Please note that an approximate cost of
$25.00 applies to all such requests.

</p><p>This notice updates and replaces any previous notices from MBNA about
the privacy, security and protection of information.
