If during your visit to our site you only browse, read pages or download material, we can not collect any information that will identify you personally, or determine your e-mail address. Our Web server automatically recognizes the domain name and Internet Protocol (IP) address of each visitor to our site. An IP address is a code that identifies a particular computer on the Internet. Every computer or network that's connected to the Internet has an IP address. </p><p>

Like most major sites, we collect and analyze that information to help us improve the site for our visitors. This helps us determine which pages you visit, how long you stay and the site you visited immediately beforehand. Your IP address is used to help identify your computer and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. </p><p>

We provide forms and links in places throughout the site for you to send comments and ideas, to ask for more information and to report problems you may experience on our site. Even if you e-mail us through one of our response forms on the site, we cannot determine your e-mail address unless you include it in your response. With your permission, we may wish to post your comments on our site. We will not identify you personally, only by first name or initials, and certainly will not disclose your e-mail address. </p><p>

If you purchase goods through this site, you will be asked to provide personal and financial information so that we may process your order. Also, we use "cookies" (including one stored on your computer) to keep track of your shopping cart as you move through the store. Cookies are bits of information that allow our server to recognize your computer. For our members, cookies also allow us to recognize you as having special access to the Members Place. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests; to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site; and to learn from your visits how you move through the site so that we may continue to improve your E-Quarium experience. We safeguard this information and do not share it with others for any reason. </p><p>

</li><li>If you or your child is under age 13, the consent of a parent is required before we will collect or use any personal information.  
</li><li>At any time, a parent may review the child's personal information, ask us to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of information from the child.
