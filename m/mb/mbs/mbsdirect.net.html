	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p><u>Effective Date:</u> &lt;<file_modified_date>&gt;</file_modified_date></p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy describes and
	governs the information collection, use and sharing practices of MBS Direct,
	LLC ("MBS") with respect to this website.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<h2>Definitions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li><u>We</u>, <u>our</u> and <u>us</u> means MBS, the operator of this website.</li>

				<li><u>You</u> and <u>your</u> means you, the person visiting this website.</li>

				<li><u>Personal information</u> means the following information about you that
				we collect: name, mailing address, billing address, e-mail address, telephone
				number, credit card information and any other information collected or stored
				in conjunction with your name. Personal information does not include aggregate
				information about our customers in which your identity cannot be discerned.</li>

				<li><u>Contractor</u> means a third party that is not owned or controlled by
				MBS, but that has been retained to provide certain services for us, on our
				behalf or through our website(s).</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>

			<ol>
				<li><u>The Purpose for Collecting and Use of Your Information.</u> We collect
				personal information and other information from you, and about you, to provide
				you with products and information that you request, to send you news and
				information about our company, products and services, to diagnose problems with
				our computer systems and administer our website, and to enhance your online
				experience, as described in greater detail below.</li>

				<li><u>The Sources from Which We Collect Information and Use of Such
				Information.</u></li>

				<li><i>Your Submissions.</i> We collect personal information that you provide
				to us when you register for an account, Promotion (defined below) or other
				program on our website, place or commence an order, e-mail us or call us.</li>

				<li><i>Collection from Educational Institutions.</i> In some situations MBS has
				agreed to provide services to educational institutions including, among other
				services, making available books and other course materials to those
				educational institutions' students. In such situations, the educational
				institution may provide MBS with personal information about you (for example,
				your student e-mail address) so that we can send you news and information about
				our company, products or services.</li>

				<li><i>Automatic Collection.</i> We automatically receive certain types of
				information whenever you interact with us through our website. For example,
				when you visit the site, our systems, or those of our service providers, may
				automatically recognize your IP address(es), domain name and general location,
				a unique identifier for your Internet-enabled device, date and time of visits, the
				type of browser you use, the website from which your visit originated, the
				website you visit after leaving our website, page visits, time spent on web
				pages, the advertisements clicked on or scrolled over and other data. Below we
				describe certain information collected, and the actions and technologies that
				facilitate the collection of such information, in greater detail.

				<ul>
					<li>
						<u>IP Address.</u>
						Your "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer
						by your Internet service provider whenever you are on the Internet. When you
						view pages of our website, our servers may record or "log" your IP Address and
						sometimes your domain name and general location.
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>Device IDs.</u>
						You may be visiting our website from your mobile device, such as a mobile phone
						or tablet.  Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices
						and we or our third-party service providers may receive such information if you
						access our website through mobile devices. Some features of the website may
						allow for the collection of mobile phone numbers, and we may associate that
						phone number to mobile device identification information. Furthermore, some
						mobile device providers operate or offer systems that can pinpoint the physical
						location of a device that uses the provider's service. Depending on the
						provider, we or our third-party service providers may receive this location
						information.
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>E-mail.</u>
						If you receive e-mail from us, we may use certain tools to capture data, including
						when you open our message, click on any links or banners it contains and/or
						make purchases.  Certain e-mail messages may also contain tracking pixels or
						similar technologies, which collect and provide us with information while you
						are on our website.
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>Cookies.</u>
						Our website uses "cookies" to customize your shopping experience or to keep track
						of your shopping cart. Cookies make web surfing easier for you by saving your
						customer identification information (i.e., username, password, shopping cart
						information, user preferences, etc.) while you are at our website. Cookies also
						track where you travel on our website and what you look at and purchase, and
						where you go after you leave our website. When you visit our website again, the
						cookie allows the website to recognize your browser and customize your experience.
						You can set your browser to refuse cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
						being sent. However, some website features or services may not function
						properly without cookies.
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>Clear GIFs/Tracking Pixels.</u>
						A clear GIF or tracking pixel is typically a one-pixel,
						transparent image (although it may be visible) located on a web page or in an
						e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the
						Internet enabling the verification of a person's viewing or receipt of a web
						page or message.
					</li>
				</ul>

				We may use the information
				described above to operate the website and to provide general statistics
				regarding the use of the website, to analyze and develop our business strategy
				and to determine how you found out about us, your interests regarding our
				products and services and how to improve our website or in creating marketing
				programs for you and others. To accomplish all this, and also to allow us to
				offer our customers streamlined ordering and other useful features, we, as do
				many websites, use and allow our third-party advertising companies, software
				vendors, fulfillment companies and contractors to use the technologies listed
				above and other similar technologies ("Tracking Technologies"). WE HAVE NO
				RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRACKING, DATA COLLECTION OR OTHER
				ACTIVITIES OF THIRD PARTIES.  In some cases, we may link information that is
				not personal information and which was automatically collected through Tracking
				Technologies with certain of your personal information.</li>

				<li><i>Information from Other Sources.</i> We may obtain information about you
				from outside sources and combine it with your account information. For example,
				we may purchase demographic and other marketing information from third parties
				to help us better serve you or inform you about products or services that we
				think will be of interest to you. We sometimes receive updated delivery and
				address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct
				our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.
				Finally, we may also purchase lists containing your personal information (e.g.,
				address, phone number, e-mail address) for advertising and marketing purposes.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Your Ability to Opt Out from Receiving Certain Communications from MBS</h2>

			<p>At any time you may choose to opt
				out from receiving marketing communications from us. You can opt out of
				receiving such communications by clicking on an "opt-out" link
				provided at the bottom of an e-mail that you receive from us, or by calling our
				Customer Service Department at &lt;<contact_phone>&gt;. Your request will be handled
				promptly, although you may still receive marketing communications that were
				already in process prior to receipt of your request. Additionally, we may
				continue to send you communications relating to your orders, technical matters
				related to the website, and the Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy.</contact_phone></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>MBS's Ability to Share your Personal Information</h2>

			<ol>
				<li><u>Generally.</u> We do not rent, sell or share personal information about
				you with other people or companies except in the situations described below.</li>

				<li><u>Sharing Your Information with Our Contractors.</u> From time to time we
				may share personal information with contractors that provide us with services.
				We may share information provided by you directly or through Tracking
				Technologies with contractors that provide support services to us such as our
				e-commerce software vendor, fulfillment companies, transaction processor,
				printer, mailing house, or web host or with companies that help us market,
				distribute, or sell our products and services. We also may share information
				provided by you to contractors that conduct research and analysis concerning
				the people who request information from us. We also may share your personal
				information with contractors that provide a service directly to you through our
				website. These contractors may need information about you in order to perform
				their functions. HOWEVER, A CONTRACTOR
				PROVIDING A SERVICE DIRECTLY TO YOU THROUGH OUR WEBSITE MAY COLLECT PERSONAL
				INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM YOU. SUCH CONTRACTOR MAY HAVE
				ITS OWN TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY, AND WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
				OR LIABLE FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF SUCH CONTRACTOR.</li>

				<li><u>Sharing Your Information with Advertisers.</u>  We may participate in
				behavioral-based advertising. This means that we or a third party may use
				Tracking Technologies to collect information about your use of our website or
				other internet usage so that they can provide advertising about products and
				services tailored to your interest. That advertising may appear either on our
				website, or on other websites. We also may share traffic and transaction
				information with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and
				anonymous basis.</li>

				<li><u>Sharing Your Information with Publishers.</u> In some instances, we may
				share your personal information with the publisher, copyright holder or author
				of the products you purchase from us. These parties may use your information to
				send you updates, corrections or other information related to those materials.</li>

				<li><u>Sharing Your Information with Educational Institutions.</u> We may share
				your personal information with any educational institutions to which you
				indicate that you belong and with which we have a contractual obligation. The
				educational institution may use your personal information to verify that you
				have obtained books and other course materials required for a particular
				course. The educational institution may also use your personal information to
				verify that MBS is in compliance with any agreements between MBS and the
				educational institution.</li>

				<li><u>Share Links.</u> We may use third-party advertising companies to serve
				ads when you visit our website. The website also may contain links to other
				websites that are not under our control. These links may include the use of
				so-called "share links." A "share link" is a button and/or text link appearing
				on our website that enables the launch of a sharing mechanism whereby you can
				post links to, and content from, the website onto social networking websites
				such as Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest. The privacy policies of other website
				operators or advertisers may significantly differ from our Privacy Policy. We
				urge you to read the privacy statements of each and every website you visit and
				to contact the third-party website operators or advertisers directly if you
				have any questions or concerns about their data collection or privacy policies.
				WE HAVE NO CONTROL OR INFLUENCE OVER THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OF SUCH OTHER
				WEBSITES AND ADVERTISERS AND WE DO NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY
				FOR ANY THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE OPERATORS' OR ADVERTISERS' DATA COLLECTION
				PRACTICES, THEIR FAILURE TO ABIDE BY THEIR PRIVACY POLICIES OR THE CONTENT OF
				ANY THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES.</li>

				<li><u>Sharing Your Information with Law Enforcement.</u> We fully cooperate
				with reasonable requests for information from law enforcement agencies. As a
				result, we reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any
				activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably
				believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity. In
				addition, we reserve the right to release your personal information to law
				enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you
				have violated our policies, or the release of your information may protect the
				rights, property or safety of MBS, you or one of our other customers.</li>

				<li><u>Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law.</u> We may disclose
				personal information when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with
				the law or protect the rights, property or safety of ourselves or others; when
				it is necessary to identify or contact you in connection with, bring or defend
				legal action against persons or entities that we believe may be causing harm to
				you, our company or third parties; and, when necessary, to protect or defend
				our rights or property.</li>

				<li><u>Sharing with Affiliates and Successors.</u>  We may share personal
				information with our parent, subsidiary and sister companies (collectively,
				"Affiliates"), and they may use such information to market to you, so long as
				those Affiliates comply with this Privacy Policy. We may also disclose your
				personal information to any actual or potential successor-in-interest of ours,
				such as a company that is seeking to acquire us, the website, or the business
				and activities carried on via the website.</li>

				<li><u>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions.</u> Occasionally, we may run a
				promotion such as a sweepstakes or a contest (a "Promotion"), and you will be
				given the opportunity to enter by filling out an entry form, or in some cases,
				you may be automatically entered by using a designated type of credit card when
				placing an order in store, online or via phone. Your entry information may be
				shared with third parties for the limited purposes of administering the
				sweepstakes and selecting a winner(s) and may be used to notify you in
				connection with the sweepstakes or contest and to verify your identity. Some
				Promotions may have one or more co-sponsors, and you may also be asked upon
				entry to consent to receive future communications from such co-sponsors. In the
				event your consent is indicated, the information from your entry will be shared
				with the co-sponsors. IN THOSE
				SITUATIONS, THE THIRD PARTIES WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR
				THEIR OWN PURPOSES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR OWN POLICIES, AND WE ARE NOT
				RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW CO-SPONSORS MAY USE YOUR INFORMATION. In all events,
				we will make it clear to you in the entry, order or registration form, before
				you submit it, whether you are consenting to receive information from any third
				party, and you will be given the opportunity to opt not to receive such
				information at the time you submit your entry, order or registration.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Security of Your Information</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>We have reasonable and
				appropriate physical, electronic and procedural security safeguards to protect
				and secure the information we collect. Nonetheless, no data transmission over
				the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot
				guarantee the security of any information you transmit to or from our website,
				and you do so at your own risk.</li>

				<li>Our website uses Secure Sockets
				Layer (SSL), a protocol used to encrypt data during transmission over the
				Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online
				transactions.</li>

				<li>ALTHOUGH WE WILL TAKE REASONABLE
				SECURITY PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM AND
				STORED ON THE SITE, BECAUSE OF THE OPEN NATURE OF THE INTERNET, WE CANNOT
				GUARANTEE THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED ON OUR SERVERS, TRANSMITTED TO OR
				FROM A USER, OR OTHERWISE IN OUR CARE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY SAFE FROM INTRUSION BY
				OTHERS, SUCH AS HACKERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY THEFT
				OR LOSS OF, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DAMAGE TO, OR INTERCEPTION OF ANY DATA OR
				COMMUNICATIONS. BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU ASSUME THESE RISKS.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Unauthorized Access of Your Information</h2>

			<p>In the event that your personal
			information is accessed by an unauthorized individual, we will conduct an
			investigation to determine if there is a reasonable possibility that personal
			information has been, or will be, misused. In the event that we determine that
			misuse is reasonably possible, we will notify you of the unauthorized access
			unless a law enforcement agency believes that such notification may interfere
			with a criminal investigation. Notification of such an event may be given to you
			by e-mail, writing or telephone.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Editing Your Personal information</h2>

			<p>Once you have provided personal
			information to us, we may store and maintain that information indefinitely. You
			may review and edit certain profile information online by logging into your account
			and accessing the "My Profile" or "My Account" page, where you will be able to
			edit your information.  Additionally, you may contact us using the contact
			information below and we will edit or delete your information except as
			prohibited by law.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Collection of Information from Children</h2>

			<p>We do not direct this website at
			children; we direct the website to adults that may purchase children's books
			and other materials. We do not seek information from children.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>International Users</h2>

			<p>Your personal information will be
			stored and processed on our computers in the United States of America. The laws
			on holding personal information in the United States of America may vary and be
			less stringent than laws of your state or country. For example, if you are
			located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data
			collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may
			transfer information, including personal information, to a country and
			jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your
			jurisdiction. If you object to your personal information being transferred or
			used in this manner, please do not register with or use the website.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Other Websites</h2>

			<p>Our website, or our e-mails, may
			link to non-MBS websites. It is also possible that non-MBS websites or e-mails
			may link to our website. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy
			practices employed by any third-party websites. We encourage you to read the
			privacy policies of these websites before transmitting any personal
			information.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>

			<p>Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you
			not be "tracked" online. At this time we do not modify your experience based
			upon whether such a signal is broadcast.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>

			<p>We reserve the right to modify or
			amend this policy at any time by posting the revised policy on our website, so
			we encourage you to review the policy periodically. Any material changes in how
			we collect, use or share your personal information will only affect the
			information we collect after the effective date of the change to our policy,
			unless we obtain your consent otherwise. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Questions or Comments</h2>

			<p>If you have any questions or
			comments concerning this Privacy Policy, please contact MBS Customer Service at
			&lt;<contact_phone>&gt;.</contact_phone></p>
