                                    	<p><span class="text-bold">Collection from educational institutions.</span> In some situations MBS has agreed to provide services to educational institutions including, among other services, making available books and other course materials to those educational institutions' students. In such situations, the educational institution may provide MBS with personal information about you (for example, your student e-mail address) so that we can send you news and information about our company, products or services.</p>
                                    	<p><span class="text-bold">Automatic collection.</span> We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us through our website. For example, when you visit the site, our systems, or those of our service providers, may automatically recognize your IP address(es), domain name and general location, a unique identifier for your Internet-enabled device, date and time of visits, the type of browser you use, the website from which your visit originated, the website you visit after leaving our website, page visits, time spent on web pages, the advertisements clicked on or scrolled over and other data. Below we describe certain information collected, and the actions and technologies that facilitate the collection of such information, in greater detail.</p>

When you view pages of our website, our servers may record or "log" your IP Address and sometimes your domain name and general location.</p>

Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such information if you access our website through mobile devices. Some features of the website may allow for the collection of mobile phone numbers, and we may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information. Furthermore, some mobile device providers operate or offer systems that can pinpoint the physical location of a device that uses the provider's service. Depending on the provider, we or our third-party service providers may receive this location information.</p>

Cookies make web surfing easier for you by saving your customer identification information (i.e., username, password, shopping cart information, user preferences, etc.) while you are at our website.

To accomplish all this, and also to allow us to offer our customers streamlined ordering and other useful features, we, as do many websites, use and allow our third-party advertising companies, software vendors, fulfillment companies and contractors to use the technologies listed above and other similar technologies ("Tracking Technologies"). WE HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRACKING, DATA COLLECTION OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THIRD PARTIES. In some cases, we may link information that is not personal information and which was automatically collected through Tracking Technologies with certain of your personal information.</p>
                                        <p><span class="text-bold">Information from other sources.</span> We may obtain information about you from outside sources and combine it with your account information. For example, we may purchase demographic and other marketing information from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you. We sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.

                                    	<p><span class="text-bold">Sharing your information with our contractors.</span> From time to time we may share personal information with contractors that provide us with services. We may share information provided by you directly or through Tracking Technologies with contractors that provide support services to us such as our e-commerce software vendor, fulfillment companies, transaction processor, printer, mailing house, or web host or with companies that help us market, distribute, or sell our products and services. We also may share information provided by you to contractors that conduct research and analysis concerning the people who request information from us.

                                    	<p><span class="text-bold">Sharing your information with advertisers.</span> We may participate in behavioral-based advertising. This means that we or a third party may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your use of our website or other internet usage so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interest. That advertising may appear either on our website, or on other websites. We also may share traffic and transaction information with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.</p>
                                        <p>We currently use Google and Adobe for analytics, marketing, and advertising network services.

                                    	<p><span class="text-bold">Sharing your information with educational institutions.</span> We may share your personal information with any educational institutions to which you indicate that you belong and with which we have a contractual obligation. The educational institution may use your personal information to verify that you have obtained books and other course materials required for a particular course. The educational institution may also use your personal information to verify that MBS is in compliance with any agreements between MBS and the educational institution.</p>
                                    	<p><span class="text-bold">Share links.</span> We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. The website also may contain links to other websites that are not under our control. These links may include the use of so-called "share links." A "share link" is a button and/or text link appearing on our website that enables the launch of a sharing mechanism whereby you can post links to, and content from, the website onto social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest. The privacy policies of other website operators or advertisers may significantly differ from our Privacy Policy. We urge you to read the privacy statements of each and every website you visit and to contact the third-party website operators or advertisers directly if you have any questions or concerns about their data collection or privacy policies. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OR INFLUENCE OVER THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OF SUCH OTHER WEBSITES AND ADVERTISERS AND WE DO NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE OPERATORS' OR ADVERTISERS' DATA COLLECTION PRACTICES, THEIR FAILURE TO ABIDE BY THEIR PRIVACY POLICIES OR THE CONTENT OF ANY THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES.</p>
                                    	<p><span class="text-bold">Sharing your information with law enforcement.</span> We fully cooperate with reasonable requests for information from law enforcement agencies. As a result, we reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity. In addition, we reserve the right to release your personal information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have violated our policies, or the release of your information may protect the rights, property or safety of MBS, you or one of our other customers.</p>
                                    	<p><span class="text-bold">Sharing your information as permitted by law.</span> We may disclose personal information when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or protect the rights, property or safety of ourselves or others; when it is necessary to identify or contact you in connection with, bring or defend legal action against persons or entities that we believe may be causing harm to you, our company or third parties; and, when necessary, to protect or defend our rights or property.</p>
                                    	<p><span class="text-bold">Sharing with affiliates and successors.</span> We may share personal information with our parent, subsidiary and sister companies (collectively, "Affiliates"), and they may use such information to market to you, so long as those Affiliates comply with this Privacy Policy. We may also disclose your personal information to any actual or potential successor-in-interest of ours, such as a company that is seeking to acquire us, the website, or the business and activities carried on via the website.</p>
                                    	<p><span class="text-bold">Contests, sweepstakes and promotions.</span> Occasionally, we may run a promotion such as a sweepstakes or a contest (a "Promotion"), and you will be given the opportunity to enter by filling out an entry form, or in some cases, you may be automatically entered by using a designated type of credit card when placing an order in store, online or via phone. Your entry information may be shared with third parties for the limited purposes of administering the sweepstakes and selecting a winner(s) and may be used to notify you in connection with the sweepstakes or contest and to verify your identity. Some Promotions may have one or more co-sponsors, and you may also be asked upon entry to consent to receive future communications from such co-sponsors. In the event your consent is indicated, the information from your entry will be shared with the co-sponsors. IN THOSE SITUATIONS, THE THIRD PARTIES WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR OWN POLICIES, AND WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW CO-SPONSORS MAY USE YOUR INFORMATION. In all events, we will make it clear to you in the entry, order or registration form, before you submit it, whether you are consenting to receive information from any third party, and you will be given the opportunity to opt not to receive such information at the time you submit your entry, order or registration.</p>
