<p>                  PERSONS OR PARTIES COVERED This Privacy Policy is intended to cover all  visitors to this website, all subscribers to lists or newsletters  whether paid or unpaid, all members or affiliates whether paid or  unpaid, and all customers. Persons who visit or view this website,  whether intentionally or unintentionally, whether solicited or  unsolicited, are described herein as "Visitors" and are parties to this  Privacy Policy. Subscribers to lists or Newsletters are referred to  herein as "Subscribers" and are parties to the Privacy Policy. Persons  who join an organization or marketing endeavor (e.g. "affiliates")  promoted by this website are called "Members" herein and are covered by  this Privacy Policy. Finally, anyone who orders, attempts to order, or  receives a product sold (recipients) or advertised from this website is  called a "Customer" herein and is subject to this Privacy Policy not  only by passive acceptance, but by virtue of the Purchase Agreement  contract. The website, its agents, owners, operators, and employees are  referred to collectively herein as "Website," "Site," and/or "Seller".</p>
<p>                  <strong>PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE STILL COVERED</strong></p>
<p>                  In the event that a person excluded from this website because of the  Terms of Use or from denial of service by the website, who nonetheless  unlawfully views this site, that person remains subject to the terms of  this Privacy Policy and is in violation of the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>                  <strong>PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE</strong></p>
<p>                  This website is not lawfully accessible to persons under the age of 18  or who are otherwise covered by the provisions of the Child Online  Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA). If you are under the age of 18 you must  leave this site immediately. Fraudulent use of this website may make  you subject to civil or criminal sanctions.</p>
<p>                  <strong>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</strong></p>
<p>                  Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion of the  consideration required for your right to visit the website. If you do  not accept these terms, you have no right to visit this site and you  are fraudulently using this site.</p>
<p>                  <strong>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</strong></p>
<p>                  This website routinely collects information about its visitors,  subscribers, members, and customers. This information is obtained in  various ways, such as:</p>
<p>                  <strong>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ‘REGISTRATION’</strong></p>
<p>                  Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer  takes active, positive steps to communicate information to this  website. This can include pages or ‘pop ups’ where you register for a  newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your  participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information  from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an  affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it  may be from ordering a product.</p>
<p>                  Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the  website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant  service processing. This information is kept at the highest level of  security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service  provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.</p>
<p>                  <strong>ONLINE ORDERING</strong></p>
<p>                  Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping  cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and  Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide  complete credit card numbers. In the process of online ordering, the  customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone  number, CVS (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password.  You should consider all this information available to the website. This  information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase  Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.</p>
<p>                  <strong>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong></p>
<p>                  Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under  two conditions: one, they give their permission for contact by the  website; two, they are subject to the general ‘SUBMISSION’ agreement of  this policy. While your email address may or may not be used to solicit  you, it is added to the website’s general solicitation database.</p>
<p>                  <strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</strong></p>
<p>                  If you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you  communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects  information about your communication and by communicating with the site  you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise  use any information collected as the site sees fit.</p>
<p>                  Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>                  <strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</strong></p>
<p>                  Visitors clicking on banners or pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising,  appearing on this website must assume that information is being  collected about them. This site is not responsible for the use of  information collected in such a fashion. Visitors must assume that (1)  information will be collected, (2) that ‘cookies’ will usually be  placed on their hard drive, (3) that website does not have any control  over what happens with this information, (4) that website takes no  responsibility over the accuracy or content of advertisers, (5) that  website is not responsible for downloads from third party advertisers  that contain viruses or worms or other computer code that causes their  computer or software harm, and (6) that website assumes no  responsibility for the data that is garnered from the click itself or  that the advertiser collects.</p>
<p>                  <strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS</strong></p>
<p>                  If you send a friend an email from this site or if you send the url or  one of our web pages to a friend, you must assume that some data is  collected about your IP address or your email address and that of your  friend. You must assume that referred emails or web pages may appear to  come from your email. You must accept fully responsibility for  referring pages or email to a friend and agree to indemnify this site  for any damage, intentional or unintentional that results from said  referrals.</p>
<p>                  <strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS</strong></p>
<p>                  Unless otherwise specified in the survey, you must assume that any  information provided to the website as part of a survey in which you  participate may be used for general solicitation for commercial  purposes and that such information will be shared with joint venture  partners, affiliates, marketing organization or used by the site itself  for product design or solicitation purposes.</p>
<p>                  <strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND ‘COOKIES’</strong></p>
<p>                  Many websites, including this one, collect information about your  computer, your email address, your IP address. You must assume that  your web-viewing or web-use activity is monitored, tracked, and  information collected. This information is not usually of a personal  nature, but it may help define your viewing habits and product  preferences even though the website may or may not have any idea who  you are.</p>
<p>                  "Cookies" is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your hard  drive. Websites use this to keep you ‘logged in’, to keep track of  search criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use of the site or  use of products sold by the site. Cookies can also be used to obtain  information about your computer configuration or your use of your  computer.</p>
<p>                  Cookies can be used to electronically gather information about you.  Again, it may or may not be personal information, but it is information  and by using this site you are expressly giving permission to use  ‘cookies’ and to use the information gathered from their use to benefit  you. You also give permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and use  any information collected for product design, product offers to you,  and general commercial solicitation purposes by this site or joint  venture partners, affiliates, and marketing organizations.</p>
<p>                  <strong>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED</strong></p>
<p>                  The use of information as described below may or may not be how  information that is collected is customarily used by this site. While  actual use of any information collected may be used quite  conservatively, you must assume that it is not. You must assume that  information collected is shared with other persons or entities for  commercial purposes. While this is uncommon in practice, you must  assume that it is as you make your decision whether or not to view or  interact with this website. This type of shared information may include  your name, address, phone number, email address and buying habits, as  well as other information. This information may be used for general  commercial solicitation by this website or other persons it is sold to,  rented to, or shared with.</p>
<p>                  <strong>INFORMATION THAT IS NOT SHARED</strong></p>
<p>                  Credit card information or other financial information is not usually  known to the website. However, in the event that it is made known, that  information is never revealed to anyone except to processing  authorities or law enforcement agencies. However, the provider of such  information gives express permission to use it in fraud investigation  or for litigation.</p>
<p>                  <strong>BULLETIN BOARDS AND PUBLIC FORUMS</strong></p>
<p>                  Visitors, subscribers, members, or customers who use any site provided  bulletin boards or other public forums, such as chat rooms, do so at  their own risk. You may not assume that the site monitors these  services or protects you in any manner from information you post  publicly or share with anyone else via these services.</p>
<p>                  <strong>SPAM</strong></p>
<p>                  By providing to this website information that forms the basis of  communication with you, such as an email address, you waive all rights  to file complaints concerning unsolicited email or spam from this  website since, by providing such information, you agree to receive  communication from us or other marketing organizations. However, all  email communication with you shall contain an ‘unsubscribe’ link where  you may notify the website that you no longer wish to receive  solicitations or information from the website and your name will be  removed from the general solicitation database.</p>
<p>                  <strong>DATA SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>                  This website takes measures to protect its data that contains  information related to you. However, as a consideration for viewing  this site or interacting with this site in any manner, you waive all  claims of any nature against this site concerning the loss, alteration,  or misuse of information. You must assume that it is possible for your  personal data to be obtained by others, such as "hackers," and used in  an inappropriate manner that may cause you harm and that you agree that  the site is not responsible for damages to you.</p>
