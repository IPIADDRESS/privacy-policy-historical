D.B.R. Marketing Group,
Inc. and MLMHelpDesk.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of
Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,
street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy
policy.&nbsp;

How we gather
information from users<br>
<br>
</span></b>
<p></p>
<span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana;">How we collect and store
information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you
elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked
to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our
site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a
purchase. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and
contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our
site. Like most Web sites, D.B.R. Marketing Group, Inc. and MLMHelpDesk.com
also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools
that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of
your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and
hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your
user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information
each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a
particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional
technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain
cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by
setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be
unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your
user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features
according to your preferences.<br>
</span> <b><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana;"><br>
What we do with the
information we collect<br>
<br>
</span></b> <span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana;">Like other Web
publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more
individualized content and advertising. Contact information may be shared
between D.B.R. Marketing Group, Inc. and registered affiliates of D.B.R.
Marketing Group, Inc. and MLMHelpDesk.&nbsp;<br>
</span>
<p>
Aggregated Information
(information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways.
For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar
information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services
(e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most
attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our
advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you
individually.<br>
<br>
</p>
<span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana;">We may use Personally
Identifiable Information collected on MLMHelpDesk.com to communicate with you
about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and
privacy policy; services and products offered by MLMHelpDesk.com and other
topics we think you might find of interest.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana;">Personally Identifiable
Information collected by D.B.R. Marketing Group, Inc. and MLMHelpDesk.com may
also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, offers, and other communications
with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation
of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information.
We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time
to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or
partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your
information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are
reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of
amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we
deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with
notice prior to disclosure in such cases.<br>

linked sites and advertisements<br>

policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link

</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana;">While on our site, our
advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or

information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third
parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether
you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on
our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or
other technology to gather information. D.B.R. Marketing Group, Inc. and MLMHelpDesk.com
does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting
information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third
parties.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana;">You should also be aware
that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message
boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be
collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in
unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are
beyond the control of D.B.R. Marketing Group, Inc. and MLMHelpDesk.com and this
policy.<br>
