<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Privacy is a primary concern today, on and off the Internet. 
We are aware of these concerns and want you to feel comfortable 
using our site.</p>

<p>MLM Brilliance believes that your personal information -- 
including your purchases, email and residential addresses, 
and credit card data -- belongs to you. We collect this type 
of information when you provide it to us, but we do not rent 
or sell information concerning our customers to third parties. 
We may partner with other reputable organizations whose products 
or services we think you might find interesting, but we will 
never share your personal information with these organizations 
unless you give us permission to do so.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use The Information Collected</strong></p>

<p>During your visit to MLM Brilliance we collect the following 
information to be stored in our system:</p>

<li>Your shipping and billing address for orders. </li>
<li>Your phone number so we can contact you concerning your 
order. </li>
<li>Your e-mail address for order confirmation and updates 
for any new information from MLM Brilliance. You may opt

<p><strong>What about cookies?</strong></p>

<p>MLM Brilliance uses a technology called "cookies"

            <h4>Testimonials to the Success of <em>Brilliant Compensation</em></h4>

            <p>Thank you very much Tim!!<br>
            I began using the Brilliant Compensation® online program almost a year ago and my results have truly been unbelievable. I was just named a top sponsor in my company last week, so I know it's working.<br>
            The beauty of using this system is that <b>I no longer have to overcome the objection of Network Marketing. This NEVER even comes up!</b>  Using the power of the Internet and the tools available, such as Brilliant Compensation®, my sponsoring efforts have gone through the roof!<br>
            I'm sold on the power of this system and intend to keep this program in my arsenal!<br>
            - Jackie U.</p>

            <p>Before using these movies, my group had one out of every 40 visitors to our website request further information about our business. <b>Now, since we have added the movies, we have one out of every 12 visitors request more information. That's a 333% increase!"</b><br>
            - V.Z.</p>

            <p align="right" style=""><a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('moretestimonials').style.display='block'; this.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode); return false;">More Testimonials</a></p>

            <div id="moretestimonials" style="display: none;">
            
            <p>After implementing the Brilliant Compensation® Online Presentation in my prospecting efforts, <b>the number of people who are eager to get started increased substantially.</b>  After watching the presentation, all I have to do with a prospect is show them how those concepts apply to our specific opportunity. Never once have I encountered the "door to door" sales objection and my prospects can see why and how it is possible to build residual income from home.<br>
            Thanks Tim Sales and Dr. Charles King, for creating such an effective and powerful tool for all of us.<br>
            - Valentina O.</p>
            
            <p>Dear Dr. King and Tim Sales,<br>
            Your video "Brilliant Compensation®" is indeed a Brilliant Presentation! It literally has <strong>demolished every preconceived idea we had about network marketing</strong>. We want to thank you for your effort and excellent skill for bringing the business of network marketing to our level.<br>
            - Peter D., Netherlands</p>

            <p>My wife Elisabeth and I are one of the Top-Levels with our NWM company in Europe. We are very well trained and educated and I'm involved in Network Marketing now for nearly 10 years. But let us tell you, that this Brilliant Compensation® Presentation has helped us to explain the advantages of Network Marketing so much better. Since we have been using this tool, <b>we have nearly tripled the amount of people who have joined via the Internet</b> in our branch.<br>
            - Bert J.</p>

            <p>While watching What the Wealthy Buy on Payday, <strong>I was just glued to my computer screen.  The information was just so good, it was so right on, it just started making me think differently than I had 10 min before watching it</strong>.  All of a sudden it created a transformation in my thought process that I took out into a lot of different things.  It's just incredibly sensible and when you're sitting there watching it, there comes a time when you go, "Oh yeah, that's me".<br>
            -   Joe S.</p>

            <p>I find that people are saying "I thought I knew what network marketing was but now that I've seen this video, I can understand it's not at all what I thought it was.  <strong>This is one of the most powerful video presentations that I've ever seen."<br>
            Having Dr. King with his Ph.D speak gives instant credibility.</strong>  He makes your case for you.  I've had people who already own their own business watch the video and say "Now I understand why I can't get ahead.  It's about leverage."<br>
            - Tom J.</p>
