Privacy Policy

<p>
We are committed to protecting privacy. The following information is to help registered and unregistered users and visitors (collectively  "Users" or "You") understand how we collect, use, disseminate and safeguard the information You provide to us while accessing and using our mobile applications and services, and websites, including: <a class="privacy-link" href="http://www.funmmo.com">http://www.funmo.com</a>, <a class="privacy-link" href="http://mlab.funmail.com">http://mlab.funmail.com</a>, <a class="privacy-link" href="http://www.funmail.com">http://www.funmail.com</a>, <a class="privacy-link" href="http://www.FunMobility.com">http://www.FunMobility.com</a>, and other websites and mobile applications  and services (collectively, "Services"). These Services include, but  are not limited to, FunMo, MLAB, America's Best Mobile Pix™, and Flirt Pix™. Additional Services may be added at any time.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the FunMobility <a href="/terms" class="privacy-link">Terms of Use</a>. Your use of the Services and any personal information You provide on  the Services remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/terms" class="privacy-link">Terms of Use</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>1.&nbsp; Information We  Collect </strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><div class="list">a.</div>User Provided Information. You may provide certain  personally identifiable information to FunMobility directly and  privately, such as first and last name, telephone number, email address  and date of birth. ("Personally Identifiable Information"), when  choosing to register at the Services, using the Services, participating  in contents, promotions, or surveys, or subscribing to any newsletters  or other distribution lists. Such Personally Identifiable Information  is protected under this Privacy Policy.
<p></p>
<p>
To  the contrary, any video, audio, graphics, images, text, or other  content submitted, transmitted, posted or uploaded, via Internet or  mobile communications, to the public areas of the Services by Users  ("User Submissions"), or such material that you make accessible to  others directly, becomes published and are not considered Personally  Identifiable Information subject to certain protections under this  Privacy Policy. You have the ability to, although we strongly  discourage it, provide personally identifiable information in User  Submissions to tell other Users about yourself, including by posting  messages to any message boards, blogs, or forums, or providing such  information through mobile communications. Be aware that if your User  Submissions includes personal information, such as your name, email  address, etc., other Users will have access to it and it will not be  protected Personally Identifiable Information. We reserve the right,  at our sole discretion and without obligation, to filter User  Submissions for personally identifiable information and to remove or  obscure entire User Submissions or portions thereof.
</p>
<p>
When  You use your cellular telephone or other wireless device to send,  store, receive, or access material, through your wireless network  carrier, such as profile information, responses to requests for  information, video, audio, text, images and photos, we may collect such  information, which may contain Personally Identifiable Information  and/or Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
</p>
<p>
</p><div class="list">b.</div>Cookies. When You visit the Services, we may send one or  more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric  characters - to your computer that identifies your web browser. You  can set your web browser to refuse cookies. However, if You do, some  features of the Services may not function properly, including time  saving features such as automatic log-in to Services after your initial  registration.
<p></p>
<p>
</p><div class="list">c.</div>Log Files. Log file information from is automatically reported by your  web browser each time You view a web page. When You register with or  view the Services, our servers automatically record certain information  that your web browser sends whenever You visit any website. These  server logs may include information such as your IP address, browser  type and language, number of clicks, domain names of websites visited,  pages viewed, and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on  particular pages, and the date and time.
<p></p>
<p>
</p><div class="list">d.</div>Clear Gifs. When You use the Services, we may use clear  gifs (a.k.a. web beacons) to anonymously track the online usage  patterns of Users without collecting any Personally Identifiable  Information.
<p></p>
<p>
Clear gif, cookies, and  log file information are non-personally identifiable information  because such information is not collected or used in such a way that an  individual User can be identified, for example, by name or email  address ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information"). Personally  Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information is  collectively referred to in the Privacy Policy as "Collected  Information."
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>2.&nbsp; Use of Information</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
Collected  Information is used to operate, maintain, and provide to You the  features and functionality of the Services. Any personal information  or User Submissions that You voluntarily submit to be disclosed online  (on discussion boards or forums, in blogs, messages and chat areas,  etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other  Users, who may forward this personal information or User Submissions to  other websites or people, making it available to the general public,  and therefore such information and User Submissions cannot be protected  as Personally Identifiable Information.
</p>
<p>
We  may use your Personally Idenifiable Information for administrative  purposes, such as notifying You of major changes in Services and news,  or for other customer service purposes. We use Collected Information,  such as anonymous use data, cookies, and IP addresses, to improve the  quality and design of the Services and to create new features and  Services by storing, tracking, and analyzing your preferences and  trends.
</p>
<p>
We use Non-Personally  Identifiable Information to: (a) remember information so that You will  not have to re-enter it during your current or subsequent visits to the  Services; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c)  monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor  aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e)  track User Submissions, and status in any promotions, sweepstakes, and  contests; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; (g) access your  information after You sign in; and (h) market our Services to  advertisers, mobile carriers, and other third parties.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>3.&nbsp; When We Disclose  Information </strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
We  may provide Collected Information to our subsidiaries, affiliated  companies, carriers, or others so such parties can, among other things:  (i) process such information on our behalf, (ii) use the information to  offer greater functionality through the Services, and provide you with  additional product and service ads, and (iii) communicate these ads to  You.
</p>
<p>
In order to describe our Services  to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties we may  disclose aggregate user information. We share Non-Personally  Identifiable Information (such as anonymous use data) with third  parties to assist them in understanding our Services, including Users'  use of our Services and the success of advertisements and promotions.
</p>
<p>
We  may release Collected Information if required to do so by law, or if we  believe that such action is appropriate to comply with state and  federal laws or respond to a court order, law enforcement request or  demand, subpoena, or search warrant. We may share Collected  Information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding  suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to,  fraud, potential threats to public safety or the physical safety of any  person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted by  law.
</p>
<p>
We also reserve the right to  disclose Collected Information that FunMobility believes is appropriate  or necessary to enforce our <a href="/terms" class="privacy-link">Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against  liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party  claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to  protect the security or integrity of our Services, and to exercise or  protect the rights, property, or personal safety of FunMobility, our  Users or others.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>4.&nbsp; Partners, Mobile  Carriers, Third-party Advertisers, and Links </strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
Our  partner websites may provide a version of the Services that are  remotely hosted on our servers. If You provided your User Submissions  or any other information, including Personally Identifiable  Information, at one of our partner websites, they have access to such  information. Similarly, Services may be provided through a variety of  mobile carriers. Partners' and Mobile carriers' use of User  Submissions and other information provided by You are governed by the  individual partners' or mobile carriers' privacy policies, not our  Privacy Policy. FunMobility is not responsible for third party privacy  policies or their compliance with such policies.
</p>
<p>
FunMobility  may allow other companies to serve advertisements through the  Services. If you respond to such ads, the advertisers may  automatically receive your information, including, for example, your IP  address. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies,  JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their  advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Our Privacy  Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such  other third parties or their websites.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>5.&nbsp; Choices </strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
You  may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information  to the Services, in which case we may not be able to provide certain  Services to You. You may update or correct your personal information,  including Personally Identifiable Information, at any time by accessing  your account information and editing it.
</p>
<p>
To  help protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such  as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity. You are  responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and  account information at all times.
</p>
<p>
If  You want us to remove your User Submissions from the Services, please  delete it. However, we cannot guarantee that your User Submissions  will be completely removed from all User devices or from their web  pages, nor that other Users will not misuse any content that you  supply. In addition the other Users may have already copies and  forwarded your User Submissions to others, making recovery impossible.  We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User  Submissions.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>6.&nbsp; Data Security </strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
We  have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to  provide data security on our Services. We take precautions to protect  your Personally Identifiable Information and other data from loss,  misuse or alteration and to safeguard and secure the data you provide  online. While we strive to protect such information after it arrives  at our Services, we cannot guarantee the security of any information  that is being transmitted over the Internet. As a result, You provide  such information at your own risk. To further attempt to protect the  security of the information from hackers who may find ways to  infiltrate our Services, email messages are encrypted, making the  reading of these message difficult.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>7.&nbsp; Children's Privacy</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
Protecting  the privacy of young children is especially important. For that  reason, we do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information  on the Services submitted by persons under 13 years of age. If you are  under 13 years of age, then please do not submit any information to the  Services at any time or in any manner.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>8.&nbsp; A Note to Parents</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
We  believe that parents should supervise their children's online  activities and also consider using parental control tools available  from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a  child-friendly online environment. These tools can sometimes prevent  children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal  information without parental permission. We adhere to the Children's  Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Parents can help by spending  time online with their children and monitoring their online use.  Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never  to provide personal information on the Services.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>9.&nbsp; International  Users </strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
The  Services are hosted in the United States and is intended for and  directed to Users in the United States. If You are accessing the  Services from outside the United States, the laws or regulations  governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure may differ from  United States laws. Be advised that through your continued use of the  Services, which is governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and our <a href="/terms" class="privacy-link">Terms of Use</a>, You are transferring your personal information to the  United States and You consent to that transfer.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>10.&nbsp; Merger or  Bankruptcy </strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
In  the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity,  we reserve the right to transfer or assign all Collected Information as  part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In  the unlikely event of our bankruptcy or similar situation, we may not  be able to control how your information is treated, transferred, or  used.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong></p><h2><strong>11.&nbsp; Changes and  Updates </strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
We  reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, add or remove  portions of this policy at any time by posting such changes to this  page. Such changes will be effective upon posting. Any changes will be  reflected by the effective date at the beginning of the Privacy  Policy. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your agreement  to this Privacy Policy and any current revisions.
