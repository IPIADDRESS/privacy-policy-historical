("MLBE") and operated in association with SportsLine.com, Inc. ("SPLN"). </p><p>SportsLine.com is responsible for all information collected and transactions performed on the Website.  Please review the <a href="/u/userservices/privacy.htm">SportsLine.com Privacy Statement.</a>   </p><p>	The Statement answers the following questions below:</p><p>1. What information is tracked and gathered on the Website?<br>2. How is the information used?<br>3. What kind of security is in place?<br>4. How do I change or remove my account?</p><p><b><a name="info"></a>1. What information is tracked and gathered on the Website?</b></p><p><b>Interactive Activities</b></p><p>Website users who participate in interactive activities (e.g., votes, contest entries, fantasy baseball, store purchases, etc.) on the Website may be asked to submit certain personal information, which may include the user's name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or credit card information.  This information may be used as follows: for internal purposes; to contact users for customer service reasons; by merchants to bill users for products and services and fulfill orders; to contact users when necessary for contest winner notification and prize delivery confirmation; and to send users information about the Website and promotional materials from MLBE, SPLN and/or their respective partners.  Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Unique identifiers, such as ID and passwords, may be collected to verify a user's identity and for use as account numbers in the Website record system. </p><p><b>Children Under The Age Of 13</b></p><p>We do not currently collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. Under certain circumstances, visitors may be asked to submit a screen name as a means of identifying communications to the Website. Children of any age should always ask aparent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. If, in the future, the Website collects personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, it will be done incompliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15U.S.C. ยง 6501 et seq.)</p><p><b>IP Address</b></p><p>SPLN uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with its servers, and to administer the Website. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your shopping cart within the Official Store of Major League Baseball. </p><p><b>Cookies</b></p><p>A cookie is a small data file that certain websites, including this Website, write to your hard drive when you visit them.  A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that a website uses to track the pages you have visited.  The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.  Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning website.  A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.  SPLN uses cookies in connection with the Website for the following purposes: to keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific things - like visiting the Website each month - without really knowing who those customers are; to keep track of your shopping cart; to make sure you do not see the same ad repeatedly; to deliver content specific to your interests; and to save your ID and password so you do not have to re-enter it repeatedly during a session.  Users should be aware that neither MLBE nor SPLN can control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data on the Website.  </p><p>If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Website.</p><p> <b>Contests</b></p><p>The majority of contests offered on the Website are also hosted from it; however, there may be cases in which a third party sponsor will host a contest and collect user information.  In those cases, MLBE and SPLN will have no responsibility or liability for such contests or their corresponding collection of user information, and users should review the privacy statement of the governing third party website. </p><p><a name="collect"></a><b>2. How is the collected information used?</b></p><p>All information collected, both what you disclose and what is collected through the use of cookies, is "aggregated" -- meaning that the information from many users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user.  MLBE, SPLN and/or their respective partners may use this aggregated information to evaluate the success of various products and in order to evaluate which new services should be made available on the Website.  Only anonymous click stream data will be utilized to help advertisers deliver better targeted advertisements.  In addition, information collected may be used as follows: for internal purposes; to contact users for customer service reasons; by merchants to bill users for products and services and fulfill orders; to contact users when necessary for contest winner notification and prize delivery confirmation; and to send users information about the Website and promotional materials from MLBE, SPLN and/or their respective partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.</p><p><a name="security"></a><b>3. What kind of security is in place?</b></p><p>The Website contains links to partners, advertisers and third party Internet websites and services which may collect data in connection with contests, promotions, e-commerce, etc. They each have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of MLBE and SPLN.  Therefore, MLBE and SPLN have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. </p><p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information on any online service or website - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.  Furthermore, while MLBE and SPLN strive to protect your personal information, neither MLBE nor SPLN can ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit in connection with the Website, and you do so at your own risk. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.  Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. </p><p><b>Security </b></p><p>SPLN utilizes a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. All user contact information is contained behind a "firewall" and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to production systems. Passwords and credit card numbers are encrypted in SPLN's secure database which is also located behind a firewall. All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted in SPLN's databases as stated above. Because password and credit card information has been encrypted, it is completely invisible to any employee who accesses it, including our customer service team. If a Website user wishes to change his or her password, a customer service representative will reset to a new one after the member has properly identified him/herself. SPLN's technology department conducts frequent site security audits and employs a third party audit company to perform additional site security audits.   Every SPLN employee is required to sign a policy which clearly outlines the company's policy with respect to security and defines the action the company will take with any employee who breaches the policy. </p><p><a name="account"></a><b>4.
