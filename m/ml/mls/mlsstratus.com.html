                            what kinds of information we gather from you, how this information is used and 
                            safeguarded, and how you can control its use.     
    
    
    </p>
    
    
    
        <h3>This privacy policy covers the following issues:</h3>
    <p>
    
    
    
        <b>What information is collected from me? </b> </p>
    <p>
    
    
    
        The kinds of information we collect from 
        you will vary, depending on how you use our website. It’s possible to browse our 
        site without submitting any personally identifiable information (“personal 
        information”) at all, but if you choose to take advantage of some of our 
        products and services, you may be asked to provide information such as a user 
        name and password, your real name, e-mail address, phone number, address, your 
        license or MLS ID#, or, for certain e-commerce transactions, your credit card 
        information. Whenever we ask for this kind of information, we strive to provide 
        a link to this Privacy Policy to help you understand how your personal 
        information will be used before you decide whether to disclose it. </p>
    <p>
    
    
    
        In addition 
        to the personal information you choose to submit, our systems are set up to 
        gather certain anonymous data to help us to better understand how the site is 
        being used and how we can improve it. This automatically gathered data includes 
        your computer’s “Internet Protocol” (“IP”) address, statistics about how 
        visitors navigate through our site, and information provided through the use of 
        cookies (which is described in more detail below). </p>
    <p>
    
    
    
        inally, as you visit our 
        site, be aware that third parties may at times be able to gather information 
        from you. For example, third party ad servers and companies that place 
        advertisements on our site may use their own cookies and companies offering 
        products or services through the LIREALTOR.com site may use their own cookies 
        and may collect and use the information you submit. In these cases, the third 
        parties would use your information according to their own privacy policies which 
        may differ from this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p>
    
    
    
        <b>How is my information used? </b> </p>
    <p>
    
    
    
       The use of your information depends on the context in which it is collected.  Therefore, pay special attention to the categories below that relate to the features of our site that you wish to utilize.  Also be aware that  LIBOR may at times be legally compelled to disclose certain information by means such as subpoenas or court orders. </p>
    <p>
    
    
    
        LIBOR may also use the information to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve and customize the contend and layout of our sites and other 
            communications tools</li>
        <li>Send you e-mail news updates</li>
        <li>Notify you of relevant products and services</li>
        <li>Track usage of our sites</li>
        <li>Notify you of upcoming events and programs </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        LIBOR will not share, sell, or otherwise provide information about you to third 
        parties, except for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Exhibitors at LIBOR trade or education shows for the limited purpose of 
            contacting you one time immediately before and after the show</li>
        <li>Other vendors for the limited purposes as stated in the vendor contract</li>
        <li>When required by law or legal process</li>
        <li>Member benefit programs for the limited purpose of notifying you of promotions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Cookies</b></p>
    <p>
        These are small files that we send to and store on your computer so that we can 
        recognize it as a unique machine the next time you visit our site. Our cookies 
        are used for three reasons: (1) to keep track of your information for your own 
        convenience; (2) to help us optimize your online experience by altering our 
        content depending on your particular needs or browsing patterns, and to provide 
        you with advertisements, products, and services of interest to you; and (3) to 
        help us understand the size of our audience and their traffic patterns within 
        our network. Some of our advertisers and third-party ad servers may also utilize 
        their own cookies. Also, companies offering products or services through the 
        LIREALTOR.com website may use their own cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Registration</b></p>
    <p>
&nbsp;The information you provide when you become a registered user to certain pages of 
        our site is used primarily to help us customize your online experience. Your 
        e-mail address serves as a unique identifier in our record system, and it is 
        used together with your password to prevent unauthorized access to any 
        information you choose to store on our sites. The data you give us about your 
        personal preferences and demographics (such as age, zip code, occupation, or 
        other data) may be used to help us offer content, advertisements, products and 
        services that are most likely to appeal to you. In addition, we may share this 
        information, in aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers so 
        they can know how to present their ads more effectively. Please note that we do 
        not accept or store registration for anyone under the age of 13 under any 
        circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unless you specify that you’d prefer not to hear from us, we may also use the 
        e-mail address you provide at registration to contact you for promotional, 
        administrative, or other reasons. You may have these communications terminated 
        at any time. If you indicate that you’re interested in hearing from other 
        companies, we may also share your contact information for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Tools</b></p>
    <p>
        Our sites allow you to use many helpful tools, such as financial and home 
        improvements calculators, real estate search tools, and others, without 
        disclosing any personal information. These tools are for your benefit and the 
        information you submit when you use them (typically impersonal data) is not 
        disclosed to anyone or used for any purpose other than to provide you with the 
        service you’re seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>User Registration Services</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        You may choose to request products or services of a more substantial or personal 
        nature when using our website. You may store your preferences for convenience in 
        using our sites, or make an online purchase. The information you provide when 
        seeking these services may be used in the following ways:
    </p>
    <p>
        For services provided by the LIREALTOR.com website, the information you submit 
        is used by us to provide the service you’ve requested. We may also share this 
        information with subcontractors, but only to the extent necessary to fulfill 
        your request. In addition, we may use the contact information and nonfinancial 
        order information you’ve supplied, such as your e-mail address, as set out in 
        the Registration section above. If the service you request requires submission 
        of financial information such as credit card number for an online purchase, rest 
        assured that this financial information is used only for processing your 
        payment, and is not retained after completion of your order unless you have 
        given us the authority to make automatic payments on your credit card. In that 
        event, your credit card information will be retained by us until you cancel your 
        automatic payments. We may, however, store your nonfinancial order information 
        for accounting purposes and to help us to understand your preferences better so 
        that we can offer you future products or services that you may find useful.</p>
    <p>
        <b>E-mail Contact Information </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        LIBOR may use your e-mail address to directly send you information and may 
        provide you with online informational or marketing messages that have been 
        approved by LIBOR together with other communications to which you have 
        subscribed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Credit Information</b></p>
    <p>
        Credit information that you and credit authorizers provide when you make 
        payments by credit card for products, dues, or other services will only be used 
        to process the transactions you request. This information will be provided to 
        and maintained by reputable credit reporting databases, but will never be sold, 
        shared, or provided to other third parties.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Purchasing Products And Managing Your Services</b></p>
    <p>
        For products and services offered to you jointly by  LIBOR and a third party, your information may be shared with or independently gathered by the third party. In these situations,  LIBOR will only use your personal information as it would as if it offered the product or service by itself, but the third party may use the information in different ways. You can tell when a product or service is offered by a third party because a page of our site will be “co-branded” displaying the third party’s logo and/or name along with our own, or you will be linked to the third party’s site to complete the transaction. Please be aware that each company we do business with has its own policies regarding the use and protection of your information that may differ from those outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal information might be used or protected by a third party, we encourage you to become familiar with that company’s privacy policy before using the service or requesting the product, or to not request the particular product or service.  From time to time, we may wish to use personal information you provide when requesting a product or service for purposes beyond those listed above.  If this is the case, you will always be notified of the additional use prior to your submitting the personal information, and you’ll be given a chance to “opt out” of that use or to not complete the request, or to not  respond to or participate in the survey, contest, or other request.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Solicited Information</b></p>
    <p>
        You may occasionally see contests, surveys, and other features of our site that 
        ask you to provide us with personal information. When you choose to respond to 
        these requests, the personal information you offer may be used for several 
        purposes. These include the uses set out in the registration section above. They 
        also include providing information to third parties as necessary for prize 
        fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or similar offerings. If we are 
        going to use your personal information for any other purpose, we will notify you 
        of that purpose and give you a chance to opt-out before responding to our 
        survey, contest form, or other request, or not to respond to or participate in 
        the survey, contest, or other request.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>User Initiated Communication</b></p>
    <p>
        Our website enables you to send e-mails to us or to third parties and to 
        participate in public bulletin boards and discussion groups. Whenever you choose 
        to initiate these kinds of communication with us, or anyone else, you may expect 
        to be contacted in return.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Automatically Gathered Data</b></p>
    <p>
        The information gathered automatically by our system—such as your computer’s IP address, the kind of browser you’re using, and a record of your navigation through our site—may be used by  LIBOR so we can understand how to make our sites convenient and useful to our audience.  In addition, we may share this information, in aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers so they can know how to present their advertisements more effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Advertising</b></p>
    <p>
        Some of our sites may contain advertising placed by advertising networks 
        pursuant to agreements between LIBOR and the advertising networks. We do not 
        control these advertising networks, the sites of third parties reached through 
        links on our site, or their information collection practices, and LIBOR will not 
        be responsible for the activities of these third parties. The advertising 
        networks use cookies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information 
        when you click on the banner ads appearing on our sites. This information is 
        collected by the advertising networks for purposes of measuring and reporting on 
        the advertising to advertisers and LIBOR. The advertising networks may also 
        aggregate the information for certain other statistical and reporting purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What choices do I have regarding the use of my information?</b></p>
    <p>
        Reading this Privacy Policy should help you understand how any information you 
        share with us might be used. If you feel concerned about any of these uses, you 
        might elect not to participate in certain services, features, or products that 
        we offer. We will never collect personal information about you without your 
        knowledge, so the decision whether or not to share this information is 
        completely up to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How do I "opt out"?</b></p>
    <p>
        You also have the ability to terminate e-mail newsletter correspondence from us 
        at any time. You will be given the chance to opt-out of direct mailings when you 
        disclose your e-mail address to us, you can simply reply to our e-mail typing 
        “Unsubscribe” in the subject line, or e-mail the appropriate webmaster below 
        with your request and we will promptly remove your address from that e-mail 
        service: <a href="mailto:info@LIREALTOR.com">info@LIREALTOR.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you feel concerned about the cookies that are sent between our computers and 
        yours, you may, through your Web browser, either choose to reject them 
        automatically, or have your computer prompt you before accepting them. 
        Generally, this is done by selecting the appropriate cookies setting on your Web 
        browser (usually found in “Internet Options” or “Preferences”). Please note, 
        however, that some of our features and services depend on the use of cookies. 
        Therefore, you will be unable to take advantage of those features if you choose 
        not to accept cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How is my information protected?</b></p>
    <p>
        Whenever personal information about you is stored on our computers, that 
        information is password-protected from unauthorized access or use. In addition, 
        this information is kept only on servers that are located behind a firewall 
        which makes their contents inaccessible to outside users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since your financial information is especially sensitive, we take special care 
        to keep it secure. We will only transmit or ask for this information over secure 
        Internet connections, using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, the currently 
        accepted standard for online security and security keys. In addition, we require 
        password authentication from any third parties you’ve authorized to receive this 
        information. Finally, your credit card number and financial information are 
        never stored on our servers. While this means you may have to enter this 
        information more than once, we believe the added security is worth the extra 
        effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, we appreciate your help in safeguarding the integrity of your own and 
        others’ privacy. We hope you’ll use common sense whenever you disclose personal 
        information over the Internet. Just as importantly, we encourage you to let us 
        know immediately if you suspect that the information you share with us is being 
        used in any way contrary to this privacy policy. To contact us, please send an 
        e-mail to: <a href="mailto:info@LIREALTOR.com">info@LIREALTOR.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Scope of This Privacy Policy: Outside Links </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy only applies to sites owned and operated by LIBOR. 
        Our pages contain links to sites outside our control. Please be aware that these 
        sites may collect information about you and operate according to their own 
        privacy practices that may differ from this Privacy Policy. Remember that once 
        you’re outside our website, any information you submit is outside of our 
        control.
