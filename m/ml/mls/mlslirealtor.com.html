  policy may be updated from time to time so please check back frequently. <br>

  </p>
<p>MLSLI.com is committed to your privacy and security and wants to provide you
  with the best possible online experience. To that end, we want you to understand
  what kinds of information we gather from you, how this information is used
  and safeguarded, and how you can control its use. <br>
  This privacy policy covers the following issues:</p>
<h3>This privacy policy covers the following issues:</h3>
<p><strong>What information is collected from me? </strong>
</p><p>The kinds of information we collect from you will vary, depending on how you
  use our website. It’s possible to browse our site without submitting
  any personally identifiable information (“personal information”)
  at all, but if you choose to take advantage of some of our products and services,
  you may be asked to provide information such as a user name and password, your
  real name, e-mail address, phone number, address, your license or MLS ID# or,
  for certain e-commerce transactions, your credit card information. Whenever
  we ask for this kind of information, we strive to provide a link to this Privacy
  Policy to help you understand how your personal information will be used before
  you decide whether to disclose it.
</p><p>In addition to the personal information you choose to submit, our systems
  are set up to gather certain anonymous data to help us to better understand
  how the site is being used and how we can improve it. This automatically gathered
  data includes your computer’s “Internet Protocol” (“IP”)
  address, statistics about how visitors navigate through our site and information
  provided through the use of cookies (which is described in more detail below). </p>
<p>  Finally, as you visit our site, be aware that third parties may at times be
  able to gather information from you. For example, third party ad servers and
  companies that place advertisements on our site may use their own cookies and
  companies offering products or services through the MLSLI.com site may use
  their own cookies and may collect and use the information you submit. In these
  cases, the third parties would use your information according to their own
  privacy policies which may differ from this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><strong>How is my information used? </strong>
</p><p>The use of your information depends on the context in which it is collected.
  Therefore, pay special attention to the categories below that relate to the
  features of our site that you wish to utilize. Also be aware that MLSLI.com
  may at times be legally compelled to disclose certain information, by means
  such as subpoenas or court orders. 
</p><p> MLSLI may also use the information to:
</p><ul>
  <li>Improve and customize the content and layout of our sites and other communications
    tools<br>
    </li>
  <li>Send you e-mail news updates<br>
    </li>
  <li>Notify you of relevant products and services<br>
    </li>
  <li>Track usage of our sites</li>
</ul>
<p>MLSLI will not share, sell or otherwise provide information about you to third
  parties, except for:
</p><ul>
  <li>Exhibitors at MLSLI trade shows for the limited purpose
    of contacting you one time immediately before and after trade shows<br>
    </li>
  <li>Other vendors for the limited purposes as stated in the vendor contract<br>
    </li>
  <li> When required by law or valid legal process </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong> 
</p><p>These are small files that we send to and store on your computer so that we
  can recognize it as a unique machine the next time you visit our site. Our
  cookies are used for three reasons: (1) to keep track of your information for
  your own convenience; (2) to help us optimize your online experience by altering
  our content depending on your particular needs or browsing patterns, and to
  provide you with advertisements, products and services of interest to you;
  and (3) to help us understand the size of our audience and their traffic patterns
  within our network. Some of our advertisers and third-party ad servers may
  also utilize their own cookies. Also, companies offering products or services
  through the MLSLI.com website may use their own cookies. 
</p><p><strong>Registration </strong>
</p><p>The information you provide when you become a registered user to certain pages
  of our site is used primarily to help us customize your online experience.
  Your e-mail address serves as a unique identifier in our record system, and
  it is used together with your password to prevent unauthorized access to any
  information you choose to store on our sites. The data you give us about your
  personal preferences and demographics (such as age, zip code, occupation, or
  other data may be used to help us offer content, advertisements, products and
  services that are most likely to appeal to you. In addition, we may share this
  information, in aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers
  so they can know how to present their ads more effectively. Please note that
  we do not accept or store registration for anyone under the age of 13 under
  any circumstances. 
</p><p>  * Unless you specify that you’d prefer not to hear from us, we may also
  use the e-mail address you provide at registration to contact you for promotional,
  administrative, or other reason. You may have these communications terminated
  at any time. If you indicate that you’re interested in hearing from other
  companies, we may also share your contact information for that purpose.  

</p><p><strong>Tools </strong>
</p><p>Our sites allow you to use many helpful tools, such as financial and home
  improvements calculators, real estate search tools, and others, without disclosing
  any personal information. These tools are for your benefit and the information
  you submit when you use them (typically impersonal data) is not disclosed to
  anyone or used for any purpose other than to provide you with the service you’re
  seeking. <br>

</p><p><strong>User Registration Services </strong>
</p><p>You may choose to request products or services of a more substantial or personal
  nature when using our website. You may store your preferences for convenience
  in using our sites, or make an online purchase. The information you provide
  when seeking these services may be used in the following ways: 
</p><p>  * For services provided by the MLSLI.com website, the information you submit
  is used by us to provide the service you’ve requested. We may also share
  this information with subcontractors, but only to the extent necessary to fulfill
  your request. In addition, we may use the contact information and nonfinancial
  order information you’ve supplied, such as your e-mail address, as set
  out in the Registration section above. If the service you request requires
  submission of financial information such as credit card number for an online
  purchase, rest assured that this financial information is used only for processing
  your payment, and is not retained after completion of your order unless you
  have given us the authority to make automatic payments on your credit card.
  In that event, your credit card information will be retained by us until you
  cancel your automatic payments. We may, however, store your nonfinancial order
  information for accounting purposes and to help us to understand your preferences
  better so that we can offer you future products or services that you may find
  useful.
</p><p><strong>E-mail Contact Information</strong>
</p><p>  MLSLI may use your e-mail address to directly send you information and may
  provide you with online informational or marketing messages that have been
  approved by MLSLI together with other communications to which you have subscribed.<br>
  </p><p><strong>Credit Information:</strong>  
  </p><p>Credit information that you and credit authorizers provide when you make payments
      by credit card for products, dues or other services will only be used to process
      the transactions you request. This information will be provided to and maintained
      by reputable credit reporting databases, but will never be sold, shared or
      provided to other third parties.
    </p><p><strong>Purchasing Products And Managing Your Services    </strong>    
    </p><p>      For products and services offered to you jointly by MLSLI.com and a third
      party, your information may be shared with or independently gathered
      by the third party. In these situations, MLSLI.com will only use your
      personal information as it would as if it offered the product or service
      by itself, but the third party may use the information in different ways.
      You can tell when a product or service is offered by a third party, because
      a page of our site will be “co-branded” displaying the third
      party’s logo and/or name along with our own, or you will be linked
      to the third party’s site to complete the transaction. Please be
      aware that each company we do business with has its own policies regarding
      the use and protection of your information that may differ from those
      outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you are concerned about how your
      personal information might be used or protected by a third party, we
      encourage you to become familiar with that company’s privacy policy
      before using the service or requesting the product, or to not request
      the particular product or service. From time to time, we may wish to
      use personal information you provide when requesting a product or service
      for purposes beyond those listed above. If this is the case, you will
      always be notified of the additional use prior to your submitting the
      personal information, and you’ll be given a chance to “opt
      out” of that use or to not complete the request, or to not respond
      to or participate in the survey, contest or other request.    
    </p><p><strong>Solicited Information    </strong>    
    </p><p>      You may occasionally see contests, surveys and other features of our site
      that ask you to provide us with personal information. When you choose
      to respond to these requests, the personal information you offer may
      be used for several purposes. These include the uses set out in the registration
      section above. They also include providing information to third parties
      as necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or
      similar offerings. If we are going to use your personal information for
      any other purpose, we will notify you of that purpose and give you a
      chance to opt-out before responding to our survey, contest form or other
      request, or not to respond to or participate in the survey, contest or
      other request. <br>
      </p><p><strong>User Initiated Communication</strong>
      </p><p>Our website enables you to send e-mail to us or to third parties and to
          participate in public bulletin boards and discussion groups. Whenever you
          choose to initiate these kinds of communication with us, or anyone else,
          you may expect to be contacted in return. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Automatically Gathered Data</strong>
      </p><p>The information gathered automatically by our system—such as your
            computer’s IP address, the kind of browser you’re using, and
            a record of your navigation through our site—may be used by
            MLSLI.com so we can understand how to make our sites convenient and
            useful to our audience. In addition, we may share this information,
            in aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers so
            they can know how to present their advertisements more effectively.
          </p><p><strong>Advertising          </strong>          
          </p><p>            Some of our sites may contain advertising placed by advertising networks
            pursuant to agreement between MLSLI and the advertising network.
            We do not control these advertising networks, the sites of third
            parties reached through links on our site or their information
            collection practices and MLSLI will not be responsible for the
            activities of these third parties. The advertising network uses
            cookies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information
            when you click on the banner ads appearing on our sites. This information
            is collected by the advertising network for purposes of measuring
            and reporting on the advertising to advertisers and MLSLI. The
            advertising network may also aggregate the information for certain
            other statistical and reporting purposes.          
          </p><p><strong>            What choices do I have regarding the use of my information? </strong>          
          </p><p>            Reading this Privacy Policy should help you understand how any information
            you share with us might be used. If you feel concerned about any

            computers and yours, you may, through your Web browser, either choose
            to reject them automatically, or have your computer prompt you before
            accepting them. Generally, this is done by selecting the appropriate
            cookies setting on your Web browser (usually found in “Internet
            Options” or “Preferences”). Please note, however,
            that some of our features and services depend on the use of cookies.

          <p><strong>How is my information protected?          </strong>          
          </p><p>
            Whenever personal information about you is stored on our computers,
            that information is password-protected from unauthorized access
            or use. In addition, this information is kept only on servers that
            are located behind a firewall which makes their contents inaccessible
            to outside users. 
          </p><p>Since your financial information is especially sensitive, we take
            special care to keep it secure. We will only transmit or ask for
            this information over secure Internet connections, using SSL (Secure
            Sockets Layer)encryption, the currently accepted standard for online
            security, and security keys. In addition, we require password authentication
            from any third parties you’ve authorized to receive this information.
            Finally, your credit card number and financial information are never
            stored on our servers. While this means you may have to enter this
            information more than once, we believe the added security is worth
            the extra effort. </p>
          <p>Of course, we appreciate your help in safeguarding the integrity
            of your own and others’ privacy. We hope you’ll use common
            sense whenever you disclose personal information over the Internet.
            Just as importantly, we encourage you to let us know immediately
            if you suspect that the information you share with us is being used
            in any way contrary to this privacy policy. To contact us, please
