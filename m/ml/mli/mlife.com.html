			<br>
			
			We believe that you should know what information we collect from you, as well as how that 
			information is used, disclosed, and protected. We have created this policy statement

			<strong>CINGULAR WIRELESS PRIVACY POLICY </strong><br>
			We have created the Cingular Wireless Privacy Policy (the "Policy") to explain our 
			privacy practices. When you use any Cingular Wireless product or service, you should 
			understand when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and protected.<br>
			<br>
			
			We will not sell or disclose information to unaffiliated third parties without your 
			consent except as otherwise provided in this Policy. We may use information about 
			who you are, where and when you browse on the Web, where your wireless device is 
			located, and how you use our network to provide you better service and enrich your 
			user experience when you sign up or use any of our products or services.<br>
			<br>
			
			Cingular Wireless will revise and update this Policy if our practices change or if 
			changes in the law so require.  <br>
			<br>
			
			<a style="COLOR: #099999" name="1"></a>
			<strong>Information Collected About You</strong><br>
			We collect a variety of personal information about users of our products or services. Personal 
			information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity, 
			such as a name, address, telephone number, email address, or information about activities 
			directly linked to that person.<br>
			<br>
			
			Our definition of personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate 
			information is data we collect about a group or category of services or customers from which 
			individual customer identities have been removed. For example, we could prepare a report that 
			indicates that a certain number of our customers always use their wireless phones at a certain 
			time of day at a specific location. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs 
			so that we can better consider new services or tailor existing services to customer desires. 
			The aggregate data also might be purchased by or shared with a third party, for example, one 
			interested in locating a business in a particular part of town.<br>
			<br>
			
			Here are the types of personal and other information we collect. You should refer to the rest 
			of this Policy to see how we use, disclose, and protect that information:  
			
			<div class="textList">
			<ul>
				<li class="black"><strong>Information You Give Us</strong>: 
				We collect information you give us when you purchase a Cingular Wireless product or use 
				services. For example, you may provide us a billing address and credit information, 
				including your social security number or business identifier, when signing up for service 
				or perhaps purchasing a product through our online store. You might not have thought about 
				it this way, but the numbers dialed from your wireless phone to make a call are an example 
				of information you give us and that we collect and use so we can bill you appropriately 
				and investigate fraudulent usage.  
				</li>
				<li class="black"><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong>: 
				We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. 
				For example, when you visit a Cingular Wireless Web site, our systems automatically 
				collect your IP address and the type of browser you use. When you browse the wireless 
				web, our systems log the Web sites you visit. Similarly, all wireless communications 
				systems know when your phone is turned on and approximately where the device is physically 
				located—that's how calls or messages are delivered to you in real time. 
				</li>
				<li class="black"><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong>: 
				We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with 
				your account information. For example, we may receive credit information for purposes of 
				initiating service. We also may use commercially available demographic and marketing 
				information from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about products 
				or services that we think will be of interest to you. We sometimes receive updated delivery 
				and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records 
				and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily. And, we often receive information 
				from the dealer from whom you purchase your wireless phone or device prior to initiating 
				service with us.
				</li>

			</ul>
			</div>
			
			We also may purchase email lists from third parties for advertising purposes. We only 
			purchase lists of individuals who have allowed third-party use of their email address 
			for marketing purposes. If you have previously requested to participate in an email 
			advertising program, the information we receive may include your name, information on 
			previous transactions, or any other personal information you have provided.  <br>
			<br>
			
			Cingular Wireless recognizes that parents often purchase our products and services for 
			family use, including for use by minors. Any information collected from such usage will 
			appear to be the personal information of the actual subscriber to the service, and will 
			be treated as such under this Policy. If we make available offers and products online 
			where a child informs us that he or she is under the age of 13, we will ask a parent to 
			confirm his/her consent in advance of further collection, use or disclosure of personal 
			information from that child. <br>
			<br>
			
			In a Business Agreement, our customer is a business or other entity purchasing service 
			for employees or other authorized users. If you receive certain benefits through a 
			business or government customer's agreement with us, this Policy will generally govern 
			your personal information. However, if you receive service where a business or government 
			entity pays Cingular for your account or is otherwise liable to Cingular for the charges 
			(for example, as a guarantor if you fail to pay), we may share your account information 
			with that entity. If you receive certain benefits tied to a Business Agreement, but you 
			are liable for your own charges, then we may share enough account information with that 
			entity to verify your continuing eligibility for those benefits. Please contact Cingular 
			if you have any questions about who is the liable party on your bill.<br>

			<strong>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act </strong><br>
			If we make available offers and products online where a child informs us that he or she 
			is under the age of 13, we will ask a parent to confirm his/her consent in advance of 
			further collection, use or disclosure of personal information from that child. You should 
			be aware, however, that wireless devices and services purchased for family use may be used 
			by minors without the knowledge of Cingular Wireless. If that happens, any information 
			collected from the usage will appear to be the personal information of the actual adult 
			subscriber and treated as such under this Policy.<br>

			<strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br>
			<div class="textList">
			<ul>
				<li class="black"><strong>Internal Use.</strong> In general, we use personal information 
				to serve our customers, to enhance and extend our customer relationship, and to enable our 
				customers to take maximum advantage of products and services we think they would enjoy. For 
				example, by understanding how you use our Web site, we are able to customize and personalize 
				your experience. More specifically, we use personal information for billing purposes, to 
				provide services or complete transactions you have requested, to anticipate and resolve problems 
				with your services, and to create and inform you of products or services from Cingular Wireless 
				or others that better meet your needs.<br>
				<br>
				<a style="COLOR: #099999" name="15"></a>
                Cingular Wireless uses email, short text messages, telemarketing, and direct mail to inform you 
				about products or services we think will interest you. You can modify your preferences on receiving 
				these types of communications: 
				<br><br>
				<div style="clear:both;height:5px;font-size:0px;"></div>
					<ul>
						<li class="secondLevel">o	If you were formerly an AT&amp;T Wireless customer and wish to

				to tell us your preferences.</li> 
				
			 	<li class="secondLevel">o	Other Cingular customers who wish to change their preferences can visit

				</ul>
				<br>
				While you may choose not to receive marketing information from us, you will continue to receive invoices, 
				customer service-related notifications, and other similar information from us electronically or otherwise.
				</li>
				<li class="black"><strong>Third-Party Use.</strong>
				You should review the following section to understand when Cingular Wireless discloses personal information 
				to third parties. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			</div>

			<div style="text-align:right"><a style="COLOR: #099999" href="#backtotop"><img src="/refresh/images/bt_top.png" alt="Back to top"></a></div>
			<div style="clear:both;height:10px;"></div>
			
			<a style="COLOR: #099999" name="4"></a>
			<strong>Disclosure of Personal Information </strong><br>
			Information about our customers is one of our most important business assets, and therefore we strive to 
			protect it and keep it confidential. We do not sell personal information to third parties without your 
			consent. When and what types of information Cingular Wireless discloses depends on the service and in 
			some cases the choices you have made. <br>
			<br>
			Cingular Wireless will not disclose personal information other than in accordance with this Policy. 
			In general, that means that you must consent to the disclosure in advance. Depending on the service, 
			we may obtain your consent in a number of ways, including: 
			<div class="textList">
			<ul>
				<li class="black">In writing;</li>
				<li class="black">Verbally;</li>
				<li class="black">Online by clicking a button;</li>
				<li class="black">Through the use of a dialing string or button on a wireless device or handset; or</li>
				<li class="black">At the time of initiation of a particular service offering, when your consent
				is part of the required terms and conditions to use that service.</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			
			For example, your consent to disclose personal information can be implied simply by the nature 
			of your request, such as when you ask us to deliver an email or short message to another person. 
			Your return address is disclosed as part of the service and your consent to do so is implied by 
			your use of the service. To determine how personal information may be disclosed as part of a 
			particular service, you should review the terms and conditions of use for that service.<br>
			<br>
			
			We share personal information with third parties as necessary to complete a transaction, perform 
			a service on our behalf (such as enhancing our ability to serve you better), or perform a service 
			that you have requested. When the third party acts solely on our behalf, Cingular Wireless does not 
			allow them to use your information for other purposes. For example, our vendors process and print 
			your billing statement on our behalf. They can only use the personal information we give them to 
			produce the billing statement. When we write off an account for non-payment, Cingular Wireless 
			sometimes discloses personal information about the account to third parties such as credit bureaus. 
			Credit bureaus may use the personal information to update their records. Cingular Wireless does not 
			currently disclose wireless numbers in directory assistance listings or published directories. If we 
			do so in the future, you will be able to choose whether your number is listed. <br>
			<br>
			
			Aside from our services, however, you may also want to take advantage of services and products offered 
			by other companies utilizing our wireless service. In those cases, you will be providing information 
			to those companies, and information about you received by those third parties will be governed by their 
			privacy policies, not this Policy. For example, if you are roaming on the network of another carrier, 
			information about your usage and the numbers you dial will be available to the carrier providing the 
			service. Also, as another example, if you purchase something using our mobile Internet service, you will 
			be disclosing personal information directly to the company facilitating the transaction, a merchant bank 
			and the merchant. Finally, if you bought your wireless device from a third party retailer or dealer, both 
			they and Cingular Wireless will have personal information as a result of the transaction and your ongoing 
			service with Cingular. Whenever third parties have a role in any such transaction, you should review their 
			privacy policies as well. <br>
			<br>
			
			From time to time you may be able to participate in contests, giveaways, or other similar promotions we 
			sponsor. Except as explained otherwise in the rules for a particular contest, giveaway, or promotion, any 
			personal information you provide will be used in accordance with this Policy. <br>
			<br>
			
			In addition, from time to time you may be able to participate in our surveys to help us improve our 
			offerings and services. Except as explained otherwise in the survey, any personal information so 
			collected will be used for our internal purposes. <br>
			<br>
			<a style="COLOR: #099999" name="5"></a>
			Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of information 
			about your telephone usage, the services you buy from us, who you call, and the location of your device 
			on our network when you make a voice call. This information is sometimes referred to as "Customer 
			Proprietary Network Information," or "CPNI." We share CPNI and other personal information about you with 
			affiliates of AT&amp;T and BellSouth Corporation (the parent companies of Cingular) that provide telecommunications 
			services to which you also subscribe. Before sharing CPNI in any other way, we will first notify you of your 
			rights under the law, describe how we intend to use the CPNI, and give you an opportunity to opt out of such 
			usage (or, when required by law, to opt in).<br>
			<br>
			
			<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> Information about our users, including personal information, may be 
			disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another 
			provider, as well as in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which personal 
			information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. <br>
			<br>
			
			<strong>Protection of Cingular Wireless and Others:</strong> We release personal information when we believe 
			release is appropriate to comply with the law or in good faith reliance on legal process (e.g., court orders, 
			subpoenas, E911 information, etc.); enforce or apply our customer agreements; initiate, render, bill, and collect 
			for services; protect our rights or property, or protect users of those services and other carriers from fraudulent, 
			abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services; facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation 
			of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government; or if we reasonably believe 
			that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure 
			of communications, or justifies disclosure of records, to a governmental entity without delay. <br>

			<strong>Cingular Wireless Use of Cookies </strong><br>
			Cookies are small files placed on your computer's hard drive by a Web site when you visit. 
			These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your 
			visit so that when you return to the site, the site knows who you are and can personalize 
			your visit. For example, cookies enable a Web site shopping cart to function so that you 
			only have to check out once. Consequently, cookies are often tied to the use of personally 
			identifiable information while using our site, and some functionality may be lost if you 
			choose not to accept the use of cookies. <br>
			<br>
			In general, we use cookies to collect information so that we can determine how to improve 
			our site by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular; to personalize the 
			site and make recommendations based on products you have liked in the past as well as to 
			improve the site experience; and to complete transactions you have requested. Advertisers 
			that serve ads on our site may also use their own cookies. Such outside cookies are governed 
			by the privacy policies of the entities placing the ads, and are not subject to this Policy. <br>
			<br>
			We also use a session-based cookie that maintains a user's session for continuity of navigation 
			while viewing the site. After closing the browser the session cookie simply terminates. <br>
			<br>
			With wireless Internet service, cookies are also used by our suppliers and third-party vendors to 
			facilitate the various services and information offered. Depending on the phone or device being used, 
			cookies may be stored locally on the phone or device, or on servers operated by Cingular Wireless. This 
			Internet cookie-like functionality is in place for the same reasons and designed for the same purposes 
			as cookies placed on your computer when interacting with Internet Web sites. Our suppliers and vendors 
			will only use this information to provision the service, but each site you visit while using the wireless 
			Internet service is controlled by a separate company and their individual privacy policies will govern 
			information they receive automatically from the cookie or information you voluntarily provide.<br>

			<strong>Cingular Wireless Use of Web Beacons </strong><br>
			A Web beacon, also known as a Web bug, is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in 
			an email message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor the address and other 
			information of the computer viewing the item. Web beacons are often invisible to the user because they are 
			typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document, or 
			email message. Web beacons are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page; users can click on "view profiles" 
			of the Web page to see whether the page is using a Web beacon. Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer 
			that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, and the time it was viewed. Web 
			beacons can also be linked to personal information. <br>
			<br>
			Cingular Wireless does not place Web beacons that link to personal information on other sites, nor does it permit 
			third parties, other than those working on our behalf, to place them on our site. Cingular Wireless does use Web 
			beacons itself and may link a particular beacon to personal information. For example, we may use a beacon to ensure 
			a user can flip between technical assistance, customer service and our online store and still be recognized as our 
			customer. <br>
			<br>

			<strong>Cingular Wireless Placement of Advertising on Other Web Sites</strong><br>
			Cingular Wireless may use third-party ad serving companies to place advertisements about our products and 
			services on other Web sites. These companies may use cookies and other technology such as Web beacons or 
			tagging to measure the effectiveness of our ads. To measure advertising effectiveness and offer selective 
			ad content, the ad serving companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our and other Web 
			sites. But the ad serving companies use an anonymous number to identify you, NOT your name, address, phone 
			number, email address, or anything that personally identifies you. The use of such cookies is subject to 
			the ad serving company's privacy policy, not the Policy of Cingular Wireless. If you would like more 
			information about these companies we use, their privacy practices, or to learn your choices about not having 
			this non-personal information used to serve ads to you, see our  
			<a style="COLOR: #099999" href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open('/privacy/privacy_advertisers','','width=472,height=600');">Cingular Wireless

			<a style="COLOR: #099999" name="9"></a>
			
			<strong>Presence, Location, and Tracking </strong><br>
			To make wireless communications possible, the network knows the general location of your phone or wireless 
			device whenever it is turned on. Your wireless device sends out a periodic signal to the nearest radio tower/cell 
			site so that the network will know where to route an incoming communication and how to properly bill for the 
			service. This is necessary to make wireless communications possible. <br>
			<br>
			If you dial 911 for emergency services, we may provide your network location to a public safety answering 
			point, emergency medical service provider or emergency dispatch provider, public safety, fire service, or 
			law enforcement official, or hospital emergency or trauma care facility. The law also permits us to disclose 
			the location of a device on our network without a user's consent (1) to a user's legal guardian or members 
			of a user's immediate family in an emergency situation that involves the risk of death or serious physical harm, 
			(2) to database management services or information providers solely to assist in delivering emergency services, 
			or (3) to a governmental entity if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death 
			or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of a device's location on the network 
			without delay. Legally required upgrades will allow us to provide a location more precise than cell site location. <br>
			<br>
			In addition, we offer optional services on our GSM/GPRS network that make use of your network location. Please 
			review the terms and conditions for each service for additional information about how the location information 
			will be used. The location used for these services is separate from the network location information when you 
			make a voice call.<br>
			<br> 
			Your wireless Internet service may also be personalized using your ZIP code or other location identifiers. 
			We use this information to serve you relevant content, and we treat the information like any other personal 
			information under this Policy. This service does not use the network location technology described in this section.<br>
			<br>

			<a style="COLOR: #099999" name="10"></a>
			
			<strong>Receipt of Marketing Messages on My Wireless Device from Third Parties </strong><br>
			You should be aware that not all advertisements appearing on or delivered to your mobile phone or device are 
			authorized by Cingular Wireless. We have developed and implemented systems in our network to reduce unsolicited 
			bulk short text messages, but we cannot at this time block all such messages. We continue to look for other 
			options to reduce these unsolicited bulk messages. If you have an email account with Cingular Wireless, this 
			service is subject to unsolicited messages as any other email service. <br>
			<br>
			It is unlawful for any third party to make an unsolicited telemarketing call using an autodialer or to 
			send a prerecorded message to a wireless phone or device. You should report any such unsolicited calls 
			to the Federal Communications Commission. <br>
			<br>

			<a style="COLOR: #099999" name="11"></a>
			
			<strong>Network and Information Security </strong><br>
			We maintain a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your personal 
			information. For example, we use accepted tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized 
			access to our systems. Also, we grant access to personal information about you to employees and 
			contractors who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. In addition, 
			we work to protect the security of your personal information when you are ordering new service via 
			the Cingular Wireless Web site by using well-known Internet encryption technologies like Secure Sockets 
			Layer (SSL). We also use encryption technologies to protect your account information when you are 
			viewing your bill on our Web site. You should be aware that Cingular Wireless has no control over the 
			security of other sites on the Internet you might visit, interact with, or from which you buy products 
			or services.<br>

			<a style="COLOR: #099999" name="16"></a>
			
			<strong>What Can I Do to Protect My Personal Information?</strong><br>
			An important part of ensuring the security of personal information is your own effort to protect 
			against unauthorized access to your wireless device and the personal information contained in it 
			and on your SIM card. Most phones and wireless PDA-type devices store calling information both in 
			the phone and on the SIM card. Therefore, before discarding your phone or PDA, trading it in or 
			giving it away, be sure you remove and retain your SIM card and follow the manufacturer's instructions 
			for deleting all personal information on the device itself. (This can be found in your owner's manual 
			or on the manufacturers' Web site.)<br>
			<br> 
			In addition, use passwords to prevent unauthorized access to your wireless device, your wireless service 
			account, and your voicemail. If you write down your passwords or user names, keep the information in a secure 
			location. Do not give your password to someone else unless you intend them to have the same full access and 
			ability to make changes to your account as you have. Change your passwords periodically.<br>
			<br>

			<strong>Updating this Policy </strong><br>
			Cingular Wireless will revise or update this Policy as it deems appropriate, including for example, if our

			for the latest information and the effective date of any changes. <br>
			<br>
			If, however, users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner materially different 
			from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via posting on this page for 30 days 
			before the material change is made. Users will have a choice as to whether or not their information will 
			be used in this materially different manner. <br>
