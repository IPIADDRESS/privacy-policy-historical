<p>
<font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
The Michigan Live Web site is maintained by MIchigan Live Inc., 339 E. Liberty St., 
Suite 210, Ann Arbor, MI 48104.  We can be reached  by e-mail at 
<a href="mailto:feedback@mlive.com">feedback@mlive.com</a>.
</font></p><p><font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
<b>HOW MICHIGAN LIVE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU:</b>  This site does not
collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when
specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.  A user's
personally identifiable information may be used by Michigan Live Inc. and its
affiliates for editorial purposes.  Unless otherwise specified, we may, however, share information with our affiliates and with carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you. Michigan Live Inc. may also use such
information for marketing and promotional purposes. Michigan Live Inc. may share
your personally identifiable information with other companies with which it
conducts business.  For example, if you enter our contests, make a purchase,
or use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to
provide these services to you. In such cases, we need to provide your
personally identifiable information to them. Or if you choose to purchase
items through our commerce site, we will forward your information to third
parties for credit card processing and order fulfillment.  We also sometimes
provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to
you that meet your needs. While Michigan Live Inc. will seek to require such
third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize
them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it was provided,
Michigan Live Inc. does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies
of any third parties.
</font></p><p><font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, sell or lease your
personally identifiable information to any third parties, unless otherwise
stated at the time of collection.  If you have any questions or concerns
regarding what is done with your information on any part of Michigan Live,
please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:feedback@mlive.com">feedback@mlive.com</a>, 
before submitting any information.
</font></p><p><font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
We also collect anonymous, aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers
and other companies that we do business with for market research and
statistical purposes.  For example, we might report to our advertisers that
a certain percentage of users are between the ages of 30-35.
</font></p><p><font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally
identifiable information  (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail
address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be
collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from
other posters or parties.
</font></p><p><font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
<b>COOKIES:</b> Michigan Live may place a "cookie" in the browser files of Michigan 
Live user's computer.  The cookie may contain personally identifiable
information.  Cookies enable Michigan Live to serve information that you have
requested, or to relate your use of  Michigan Live to information that you
have specifically and knowingly provided to Michigan Live.  You also may
occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.  Michigan Live does not control
these cookies and these cookies are not subject to this policy.  The use of
advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is common in the Internet
industry.  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you
prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when
cookies are being sent.  However, it is possible that some portions of
Michigan Live will not function properly if you do so.  For further
information on cookies and their use, see the help instructions delivered
with your browser or contact the browser's manufacturer. Michigan Live cannot
provide help regarding your browser's cookie settings.

<b>CHILDREN:</b>  Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any
information about yourself (your name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us
or anyone else over the Internet, and before making any purchases online. If you are under the age of 13, you are not allowed to use this service.
</font></p><p><font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
<b>PARENTS:</b>  We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage
and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. This service is not intended for users under the age of 13. This service does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13. Such users are expressly prohibited from submitting their personally identifiable information to us, and from using our forums and chat areas; any information submitted by such users will not knowingly be used, posted or retained by us. Any personally identifiable information collected by Michigan Live Inc. from children above 13 (that we are aware are children above the age of 13) will be used only for Michigan Live Inc.
internal purposes such as market research, sweepstakes fulfillment, and for
fulfilling requests for information or materials, and may sometimes be
included in our database.  However, such information will not be posted or
published by us, or provided to any third parties, without your prior
consent.  Additionally, anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to
other companies with which we do business, for statistical and market
research purposes as described above.  Finally, you should be aware that if
your child voluntarily discloses his name,
e-mail address, etc. on various forums or chat areas such disclosure may
result in unsolicited messages from other parties.  Accordingly, you should
discourage your child from doing so.
