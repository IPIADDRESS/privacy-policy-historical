<font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
The Michigan Live Web site is maintained by MIchigan Live Inc., 339 E. Liberty St., 
Suite 210, Ann Arbor, MI 48104.  We can be reached  by e-mail at 
<a href="mailto:feedback@mlive.com">feedback@mlive.com</a>.
</font></p><p><font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
<b>HOW MICHIGAN LIVE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU:</b>  This site does not
collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when
specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.  A user's
personally identifiable information may be used by Michigan Live Inc. and its
affiliates for editorial purposes.  Michigan Live Inc. may also use such
information for marketing and promotional purposes. Michigan Live Inc. may share
your personally identifiable information with other companies with which it
conducts business.  For example, if you enter our contests, make a purchase,
or use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to
provide these services to you. In such cases, we need to provide your
personally identifiable information to them. Or if you choose to purchase
items through our commerce site, we will forward your information to third
parties for credit card processing and order fulfillment.  We also sometimes
provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to
you that meet your needs. While Michigan Live Inc. will seek to require such
third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize
them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it was provided,
Michigan Live Inc. does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies
of any third parties.
</font></p><p><font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, sell or lease your
personally identifiable information to any third parties, unless otherwise
stated at the time of collection.  If you have any questions or concerns
regarding what is done with your information on any part of Michigan Live,
please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:feedback@mlive.com">feedback@mlive.com</a>, 
before submitting any information.
</font></p><p><font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
We also collect anonymous, aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers
and other companies that we do business with for market research and
statistical purposes.  For example, we might report to our advertisers that
a certain percentage of users are between the ages of 30-35.
</font></p><p><font size="3" face="ARIAL,HELVETICA">
Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally
identifiable information  (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail
address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be
collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from
other posters or parties.

requested, or to relate your use of  Michigan Live to information that you
have specifically and knowingly provided to Michigan Live.  You also may
occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.  Michigan Live does not control
these cookies and these cookies are not subject to this policy.  The use of
advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is common in the Internet
