            <p>This Privacy Policy covers this web sites treatment of personally 
              identifiable information that we collects when you agree to receive 
              e-mail marketing from us. It is important that visitors are fully 
              informed about the use of their personal information. We believe 
              in 100% permission-based marketing.</p>
            <p> You may unsubscribe from any of our e-mail marketing programs 
              at any time. In every e-mail communication we send, there is an 
              unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from 
              the specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink 
              provided and following the instructions that follow. We attempt 
              to process all unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. However, 
              after unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive 
              another mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address 
              in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that 
              you have opted into. We can guarantee, however, that if you should 
              ever receive another e-mail communication from us, you will be able 
              to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink.</p>
            <p> Our company reserves the right to provide aggregate or group data 
              about our users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is 
              data that describes the demographics, usage, or characteristics 
              of participants as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable 
              information.</p>
            <p> Additionally, when you open, preview or click on the advertising 
              portion of our e-mails and/or those of our marketing partners and/or 
              our affiliates, you have agreed to the terms set forth in our Privacy 
              Policy and agree that as a function of opening, previewing or clicking 
              on the advertising portion of our e-mails, that you will receive 
              new or additional marketing communications from us, our marketing 
              partners and/or our affiliates.</p>

              company is sold or acquired, or when we deem it necessary or appropriate.
