<p><font><b><phrase>Information about MP3.com's Music Greetings </phrase></b></font><br> 
<font size="-1">
<phrase>
Please read this information carefully. Use of MP3.com's ("MP3") Music Greetings service indicates your agreement with the rules and conditions listed below.
</phrase></font></p><p><font size="-1">
When you send an MP3 Music Greeting, we use the information you provide us with to customize your greeting with the recipient's name and your message, and to deliver an email notification to the recipient. We treat Music Greetings as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient and will not disclose the contents of Music Greetings, other than to the intended recipient, unless we are required to do so by law or for other reasons set forth herein.  Misuse of MP3's Music Greetings service by providing a false email address or posing as someone else when sending a Music Greeting, may result in the cancellation of your membership and the disclosure of information about you, including your computer's IP address, as part of any investigation into your actions. 
</font></p><p><font size="-1">
Under normal circumstances, MP3 will not monitor or edit the contents of the Music Greetings you send. Occasionally, however, MP3 personnel may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your greeting or the maintenance of our network. Likewise, if you contact an MP3 customer service representative to help you send a card or to verify that a card was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the card, including the recipient's email address and the message. Although MP3 uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive your information in error.
