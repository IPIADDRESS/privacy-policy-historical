							<b>Mpire Corporation - Privacy Policy</b>

							<p>
								<b>Changes to the Privacy Policy</b><br>
								Mpire Corporation ("<b>Mpire</b>") takes your privacy concerns seriously and has created the following Privacy Policy to explain to you Mpire's information collection and use practices. The Privacy Policy describes what information Mpire collects through its services and website, and how Mpire uses this information. By using Mpire's services and website, you agree that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy and you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
							</p>

							<p>Mpire may periodically update this Privacy Policy. Mpire will notify you of significant changes to the Privacy Policy by placing a prominent notice on the Mpire website. It is your responsibility to review the most recent version of the Privacy Policy and remain informed about any changes to it.</p>

							
							<p>
								<b>What Information Is Collected?</b><br>
								Mpire may collect both personally identifiable information ("<b>Personal Information</b>") and information about your use of Mpire's services and website that is not identifiable to you personally ("<b>Non-personal Information</b>"). Non-personal Information may include technical information such as the type of Internet browser you use, the date and time you access the website, your Internet protocol address, and which pages you view on the website. Personal Information may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, and place of business. You will have the opportunity to provide Mpire with Personal Information through registration for Mpire's services.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Use of Non-personal Information</b><br>
								Mpire uses Non-personal Information to improve its services and this website. Mpire may share Non-personal Information with select third parties on an anonymous and aggregate basis, but never in a way that directly connects you to the Non-personal Information.
							</p>

							
							<p>
								<b>Use of Personal Information</b><br>
								Mpire uses Personal Information to provide you with access to Mpire's services. In addition, Mpire uses your Personal Information to respond to your requests, personalize your access to Mpire's website and services, and contact you with information that might be of interest to you. Mpire will not share your Personal Information with any third party except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or with your permission.
							</p>

							<p>Mpire may disclose your Personal Information to third parties if Mpire believes that the disclosure is necessary to enforce this Privacy Policy or the terms governing your use of Mpire's services, or protect the rights or property of Mpire or another party. Mpire may also create anonymous aggregate information from your Personal Information and share this anonymous aggregate information with select third parties. This anonymous aggregate information will not identify you or your Personal Information. Mpire reserves the right to disclose your Personal Information when Mpire believes that an applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it.</p>

							<p>
								<b>Security of Information</b><br>
								Mpire uses security measures to protect the privacy of your Personal Information. Mpire limits the employees and contractors of Mpire that can access your Personal Information and requires these employees and contractors to adhere to a confidentiality policy.
