								<p>We are updating our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy effective January 3, 2017. We share them immediately below for your review. You can find our terms currently in effect following the pending update.</p>
<h2>PRIVACY POLICY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 3, 2017</h2>
<p>PRIVACY POLICY<br>
Effective date: January 3, 2017</p>
<p>This website is owned and operated by American Public Media Group (APMG).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) is applicable to all web sites and mobile applications (“apps”) owned and operated by APMG or one of its related companies or activities (collectively referred to as “APMG,” “we,” “us,” and “our”), including Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), American Public Media (APM), Southern California Public Radio (SCPR), Pretty Good Goods (PGG) and The Fitzgerald Theater, (collectively referred to as “this Site”).</p>
<p>This Policy describes APMG’s commitment to privacy and reflects the importance we place on earning and keeping our Audience’s trust.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE OF THIS POLICY</strong><br>
APMG has provided this Policy so that you will know what information APMG collects, how APMG uses this information, the types of third parties with whom APMG may share this information, and some of the choices that are available to you.</p>
<p>APMG collects certain information about or related to you through this Site. Some of the information APMG collects may be “personal information”—information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. Other information may be nonpersonally identifiable, such as your IP address.<br>
This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by additional privacy notices (“Privacy Notices”), provided at the time we collect your information. For example, certain pages of this Site may contain Privacy Notices providing more details about the information we collect on those particular pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. In other cases, specific Privacy Notices may be required to comply with the privacy laws of one of the countries, provinces, or states in which we do business.<br>
In situations where a Privacy Notice contains information that conflicts with this Privacy Policy, then the Privacy Notice takes priority.</p>
<p>Pages that contain Privacy Notices include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
• Contributors<br>
• Public Insight Network (PIN)<br>
• Pretty Good Goods</p>
<p>Please carefully read this Privacy Policy and any applicable Privacy Notices before providing information to us.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR CONSENT</strong><br>
By using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you). If you do not consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of your information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you), you may not use this Site. If you have questions about this Policy, or any Privacy Notice, please <a href="http://www.americanpublicmedia.org/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
<p><strong>OUR TERMS OF USE </strong><br>
This Policy is part of the <a href="http://www.americanpublicmedia.org/terms/">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;that govern your use of this Site. A link to our <a href="http://www.americanpublicmedia.org/terms/">Terms of Use</a> is provided at the bottom of each page of this Site.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong><br>
We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and disclose your information.</p>
<p>This Policy describes some of your choices, such as your choice to opt out of receiving “cookies.” APMG tries to offer you choices in a meaningful way and at a meaningful time—for example, at the time and on the page where you provide your information. In addition, as required by applicable laws, we will include an “opt out” link in each promotional email we send you, so that you can inform us that you do not wish to receive such communications from us in the future.<br>
Do Not Track Mechanisms. If you enable the Do Not Track setting in your browser, we won’t record your visit to our website and the third party cookies on our pages will be disabled. For more information on Do Not Track, <a href="http://donottrack.us/">click here</a>.<br>
Previously Expressed Preferences. You may change previously expressed preferences regarding how we use your information. If you have registered with this Site or downloaded one of our mobile applications, you may be able to change certain privacy preferences through your account settings. You can also unsubscribe from our promotional emails at any time, by clicking the “opt out” link in the email, and you can unsubscribe from promotional text messages at any time by texting STOP in response to a text message we send you. Otherwise, please <a href="http://www.americanpublicmedia.org/contact/">contact us</a>.<br>
<strong>THIS POLICY MAY CHANGE</strong><br>

<p><strong>Information we automatically gather when you visit American Public Media Web sites </strong><br>
Like virtually all other Web servers, American Public Media’s Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses our site. These “access logs” allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do not record a visitor’s name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other personally identifying information. Rather, these log files may contain some or all of the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The date of the visit</li>
<li>The time and length of the visit</li>
<li>The path taken through the Web site</li>
<li>The browser being used</li>
<li>A list of files downloaded or viewed</li>
<li>The amount of time spent listening to audio files</li>
<li>The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine accessing our Web site*</li>
<li>Any errors encountered</li>
<li>*Most Internet Service Providers use a “dynamic” form of assigning IP Addresses. This means that a visitor may have a different IP address each time he or she visits an American Public Media Web site. Also, many Internet Service Providers, including America Online, use “proxy servers,” which provide even more anonymity for visitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information to aid the technical administration of the sites and to better understand how each site is functioning for its users. This information may be correlated with your profile, if you have provided this data, to provide special “personalized” services. This information may also be used in aggregate form.</p>
<p>We may track your visit to sections of our Web sites in order for some site features to function properly for you. In some instances, “cookies” or a similar technology may be used to update your registration records with session information. If you do not wish to accept a cookie from American Public Media’s servers, you can adjust the settings on your browser accordingly. Refusing to accept cookies from the American Public Media server may result in some limits on the benefits that we can automatically provide as you enjoy the American Public Media Web sites.</p>
<p><strong>Information you give us</strong><br>
American Public Media does not collect personally identifying information from American Public Media Web sites unless you choose to provide that information to us. Visitors under the age of 13 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before sending any personally identifying information to American Public Media.</p>
<p><strong>Name and contact information</strong><br>
American Public Media may ask visitors (you) to provide certain personal information when you: register for a contest; sign up for an e-mail list; request information; purchase products or services; contribute material that may be used on the Web site (e.g., recipes or program reviews); participate in a discussion board or chat; or use an American Public Media form to become a member of American Public Media. You will also have the opportunity to request future e-mail contact from American Public Media regarding its programs and Web sites. American Public Media tells you whether a specific piece of information is required at the time it is requested.</p>
<p>This information may be used by American Public Media to: verify your identity; manage a contest; gather your editorial comments and feedback; contact you for additional information or administrative purposes; provide attribution for any submitted content of yours published by American Public Media, and fulfill your order or request. If you opt-in to request future contact from American Public Media, you may receive e-mail regarding its programs and Web sites; otherwise, American Public Media will contact you only if necessary for the purposes above.</p>
<p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise at the time of submission, the personally identifying information you provide will not be sold, shared, or used for purposes other than listed above. If American Public Media does wish to add your information to a shared list, it will do so only if you provide permission when you submit your information-by default, your information will not be added; you must “opt-in.”</p>
<p><!-- American Public Media uses shared lists to maximize the benefits it can provide through its network of public radio Web sites and through qualified associations. If you allow it, your name and basic contact information may be exchanged for consideration with select companies and organizations, including with other public radio stations and programs. These companies and organizations may attempt to contact you to promote a product or service that they offer. Such contacts from third parties will only be made with American Public Media's consent, and American Public Media will only grant its consent when American Public Media considers the offer to be of potential interest and benefit to our Web site users. American Public Media will not share, exchange, rent, or sell any of its lists to political parties or candidates for political office. If you do not want your name and contact information to be used in this way, you may indicate this at the time you provide the information. If you decide after you have provided this information that you do not want American Public Media to share your information with any company or organization, you may also notify us by e-mailing mail@americanpublicmedia.org. American Public Media cannot remove your name from any third party's list; you will have to contact them directly. The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) offers a Mail Preference Service that is designed to assist consumers in decreasing the amount of nonprofit or commercial mail they receive at home. For more information about this service, visit the DMA Web site at: www.the-dma.org and click on the "Consumers" tab. --></p>
<p><strong>Demographic and Personal Information</strong><br>
American Public Media occasionally conducts online surveys, sometimes in association with a contest or other offer. These surveys may ask you for demographic information such as ZIP code, age, education, or income level. Unless otherwise explicitly indicated at the time you provide the information, this information is used in an aggregate form to help us understand our audiences and improve our services. Demographic and profile information may be shared with selected third-party organizations, only on an aggregate basis, to describe the nature of our online audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Credit-card information</strong><br>
You must be 18 to engage in money-related transactions on an American Public Media site. When you do so, you will be asked for a credit card number. All financial transactions take place only on secure servers, and electronic communication of credit-card information is sent only in a secured or encrypted format. Your credit card information is saved, in an encrypted format, on internal systems that are either not connected to the Internet or are protected by advanced firewalls separate from the computers that serve American Public Media public sites. This information is not made available to any third party and is considered completely confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Special note for APM contributors</strong><br>
APM does not sell, rent or trade its members’ names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses.</p>
<p>If you use one of APM’s secure online forms to make a contribution to APM or an APM program, your name, complete contact information, and all contributions will go directly to the APM Development Department. Your contribution information will be protected in full compliance with the MPR/APM <a href="http://www.mpr.org/members/faq/memberlistpolicy" target="_blank">Member List Policy</a>.</p>

<strong>Special Note for Public Insight Network Participants</strong><br>
The Public Insight Network (PIN) is a new way for people to share their insights, knowledge and expertise with journalists to make news coverage more accurate, relevant, transparent and trustworthy. If you sign up (link to appropriate partner smart Source URL) to be a source in the PIN, journalists authorized by American Public Media may contact you via telephone, texting, survey forms, email and social media to ask editorially relevant questions about topics related to their reporting.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Information provided to PIN</strong><br>
You may join the PIN via APM, SOURCE or any organization authorized to use PIN to inform their reporting. When you sign up, you’ll be asked to supply:</p>

<li>Your insight on a topic that is relevant to our reporting.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>How APM stores your data</strong><br>
The data you supply via PIN is stored in a separate, secure database. It may be accessed by PIN-authorized journalists as part of their reporting. It is never combined with information that you provide as a part of other relationships that you may have with APM or participating PIN newsrooms. For example, it is not combined with the information you provide to APM for membership purposes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>How APM may use your data</strong><br>
APM will not use your name, personal information, or the insights you share for any purpose other than the PIN. If you agree to let us broadcast, publish or make public a specific insight, then your permission will apply only to that insight. Permission for use of a specific insight is not deemed permission for the public use of any other prior or future insight. Your name and/or personal information will never be traded, sold, or rented to other organizations. You will never be solicited for a contribution or receive marketing materials from APM, Minnesota Public Radio, any PIN newsroom, or from any other organization as a result of your participation in PIN. Your participation in PIN, and the information and insights you share therein, will have no influence or effect on any other interaction you may have with APM, MPR, or any other PIN newsroom, and vice versa.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>How other PIN newsrooms may use your data</strong><br>
APM has relationships with other organizations that use PIN in their journalism, editorial engagement and journalism education. You may sign up for the PIN via APM or any of the other organizations, and the information you share may be visible to participating organizations and may inform their news coverage.<br>
