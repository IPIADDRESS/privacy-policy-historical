        At In2M Corporation, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way 
        people live and businesses work. As a subscriber to In2M, you don't have 
        to worry about the security and confidentiality of your personal information. 
        Just like you, we want all of your personal information kept that way—personal 
        and private. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, 
        we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines. This notice describes 
        our privacy statement and practices followed by In2M.<br>
        <br>
        Federal legislation requires us to provide In2M.com users who register 
        for Mvelopes® services with a description of our information collection 
        and sharing practices. <br>
        <br>
        This document, effective July 1, 2001, specifically describes how we handle 
        your personally identifiable information and applies to financial products 
        and services for your personal use provided by In2M.</p>
      <p class="subhead">Information Collection and Use</p>
        
      <p class="main">In2M is the sole owner of the information collected on this 
        site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information except as disclosed 
        in this statement. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, 
        we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what information 
        is required to provide the requested service. To maximize the value of 
        our services, we may request or collect information from you when you 
        visit our Web sites. This privacy statement tells you what is being collected, 
        how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected 
        and to whom it may be disclosed. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="li"><b>Mvelopes® product registration.</b> In order to 
          provide you with the best support possible, we require Mvelopes Personal 
          users to register their product with In2M. When you register, you'll 
          be asked to provide your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. 
          We will also ask you for personal survey information about why you purchased 
          Mvelopes Personal. This survey is optional. The information gathered 
          from it will help us provide you with better products and services in 
          the future. Occasionally, we may also use your e-mail address to offer 
          you the opportunity to provide input to us via other surveys that will 
          help us improve our products and services.</li>
        <li class="li"><b>In2M subscription service.</b> When you sign up for

          password, and to provide us with your full name, address, zip code, 
          phone number and e-mail address. We use your username and password to 
          verify your identity, which is required to give you access to your personal 
          account information. For access to financial, investment, and credit 
          card statement download services, we ask you to provide additional information 
          such as an account number and a personal identification number (PIN). 
          We will also need to identify you if you forget your password, by asking 
          for your mother's maiden name or other unique identifier. We use this 
          information to verify your accounts with your financial institutions 
          and to provide you with access to the services you are requesting. We 
          also ask for your credit card number to process your initial and all 
          your subsequent payments. The contact information is required to establish 
          your service with the financial institutions, brokerage houses and credit 
          card companies of your choice. Your e-mail address will be used as our 
          primary source of contact with you regarding your service. In the event 
          that you receive In2M newsletters that you no longer wish to receive, 
          you may unsubscribe at the subscription center or by following the instructions 
          provided in each e-mail newsletter. We do not share your personal information 
          with third parties except as required to fulfill your request for service 
          and as required by law. </li>

          you and protect your account information, we use "cookies," 
          nuggets of data that are stored on your hard drive as a file. We use 
          cookies to verify who you are while using our Web sites. Cookies make 
          it easier, quicker, and more secure for you to log into and use our 
          Web sites. <br>
          <br>
          Cookies do not compromise privacy or personally identify users. Their 
          data is usually stored on your computer's hard drive as a file or folder 
          called "cookies," and you can delete this file anytime you 
          choose. The cookies used on our Web sites are only valid for the current 
          session and shortly become invalid. Cookies created by one site will 
          only work with that specific site. Site A, for example, cannot read 
          cookies generated by Site B and then use that information for purposes 
          for which it was not intended. </li>
        <li class="li"><b>Referrals.</b> If users elect to use our referral service 
          for informing others about our site or products, we ask them for a name, 
          phone and e-mail address for themselves and for the person/people being 
          referred. In2M will automatically send the referred party/parties a 
          one-time e-mail or call them one time inviting them to visit the site 
          or make a purchase. In2M stores this information for the sole purpose 
          of sending this one-time e-mail or making this one-time phone call.

        <li class="li"><b>Former customers.</b> We treat information concerning 
          our former customers the same way we treat information about our current 
          customers. </li>
        <li class="li"><b>Children.</b> Because of the financial nature of our 
          business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under 
          the age of 13. Therefore, we don't knowingly attempt to solicit or receive 
          any information from children.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subhead">Access to Your Information</p>
      <p class="main">In2M does not share your personally identifiable information 
        with third parties except as explained in this privacy statement. The 
        information you provide us will only be shared under limited circumstances. 
        These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="li"><b>With service providers.</b> In some 
          cases, we will employ or work with service providers such as marketing 
          or security consultants, temporary workers, third-party software developers 
          or outsourcers to complete a business process or provide a service on 
          our behalf. For example, we may use service providers to deliver products, 
          to offer online software applications or to send e-mails on our behalf. 
          While this may require that we share some information, we will only 
          share information that the service provider must have to perform the 
          requested services. For example, a service provider who delivers products 
          on our behalf would need to have a delivery address. However, these 
          service providers are strictly prohibited from using your information 
          for any purpose other than to act on our behalf. </li>
        <li class="li"> <b>For legal reasons.</b> In some cases 
          we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with the 
          law, an investigation or a legal process, such as a court order or subpoena. 
          </li>
        <li class="li"><b> In case of a sale of a business.</b> Your information 
          may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange 
          or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all 
          or a portion of a business of In2M or its subsidiaries. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subhead">Choice/Opt Out</p>
      <p class="main">We give you the opportunity to keep us from using or sharing 
        the personally identifiable information that you provide to us for purposes 
        other than those explained in this statement. We will provide you the 
        opportunity to opt-out of secondary uses of personally identifiable information 
        you provide us, whenever we gather it. Simply notify us during the information 
        collection process or contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@in2m.com">privacy@in2m.com</a>.<br>
        <br>
        We may send site and service announcement updates. You are not able to 
        unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information 
        about service. We communicate with you to provide requested services and 
        in regards to issues relating to your account by phone or e-mail.</p>
          <p class="subhead"><a name="security"></a>Security Safeguards </p>
      <p class="main">We employ industry-standard physical, electronic and procedural 
        security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information 
        that you have provided to us from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. 
        Whenever we prompt you to transmit sensitive information, such as a credit 
        card number, we support encryption of your data as it is transmitted. 
        <br>
        <br>
            In2M uses the latest technology to protect your account information 
            from exposure to unauthorized persons. Below are some of the components 
            of this security system:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="li">A username and password are required to access the Mvelopes 
          online service. </li>
        <li class="li">After entering a username or password incorrectly three 
          times, access to an account is blocked.</li>
        <li class="li">128-bit encryption scrambles your sensitive transmissions 
          made via the Internet.</li>
      </ul>
          <p class="main">You are responsible for protecting the secrecy of your 
            PIN in accordance with the terms contained in the <a href="/Pages/legal.shtm">Mvelopes 
            Online Service Agreement</a>. We recommend you not store secure pages 
            in your cache or leave your computer unattended while you are logged 
            in to Mvelopes online service or while shopping the In2M Web site.</p>
          <p class="main">Although no security measures are foolproof, we work 
            diligently to protect personally identifiable information stored on 
            the sites' servers from unauthorized access using industry-standard 
            available computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as 
            carefully developed security procedures and practices. <br>
            <br>
            Employees must review and sign a written statement to uphold these 
            practices, which include limiting access to sensitive information 
            to only those employees who require the information to perform their 
            jobs and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. We 
            use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of 
            our security measures on a regular basis.</p>
      <p class="subhead">Correcting/Updating Personal Information</p>
      <p class="main">At our Web site, we provide you the opportunity to update 
        or correct your account, financial and credit card download information.

      <p class="main"> Before we make significant changes to our privacy statement 
        or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, 
        we'll post those changes to this privacy statement at least 30 days before 
        they take effect.</p>
