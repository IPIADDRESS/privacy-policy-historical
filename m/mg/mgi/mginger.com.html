				past use of mGinger products and services. Personal information is
				information about you that is personally identifiable like your
				name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not
				otherwise publicly available.
			</li>
			<li>
				This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that
				mGinger does not own or control, or to people that mGinger does not
				employ or manage. In addition, certain mGinger associated companies
				have their own privacy statements which can be viewed by clicking on
				the links.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>
			Choices for personal information
		</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				You need an mGinger Account to use mGinger. mGinger asks for some
				personal information when you create an mGinger Account, including
				your email address and a password, which is used to protect your
				account from unauthorized access. An mGinger Account allows you to
				access many of our services that require registration.
			</li>
			<li>
				As an mGinger member, you can create a profile or mGinger community
				that includes personal information, such as your mobile phone
				number, gender, age, occupation and interests, plus other content.
				Names of persons who have referred you, names of persons you have
				referred and names of persons that your referrals have referred
				would be visible for public viewing.

				those messages, including email addresses and content.
			</li>
			<li>

				website, we collect and maintain information associated with those

				with the phone number, the content of the message, and the date and
				time of the transaction.
			</li>
		</ul>

				groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually
				identifiable user.). Such information does not identify you
				individually.
			</li>

			<li>
				We take appropriate security measures to protect against
				unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
