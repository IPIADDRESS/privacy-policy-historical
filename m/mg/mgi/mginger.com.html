		employ or manage. In addition, certain mGinger associated companies
		have their own privacy statements which can be viewed by clicking on
		the links.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Choices for personal information</h2>
<ul class="terms">

		You need an mGinger Account to use mGinger. mGinger asks for some
		personal information when you create an mGinger Account, including
