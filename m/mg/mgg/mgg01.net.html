The secure servers are protected by firewalls and other industry standard security measures.  These security measures are instituted to ensure the protection of these secure servers from unauthorized access.  However, no security system is impenetrable, and these systems could become accessible in the event of a security breach.  We have controls in place that are designed to detect potential data breaches, contain and minimize the loss of data, and conduct forensic investigations of a breach.  </p>
            <p>Our staff is required to take reasonable measures to ensure that unauthorized persons cannot view or access your Personal Information.  Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>

We are not responsible for the disclosure or interception of your information before we receive it.</p>
            <p>As a standard security practice, we will take reasonable steps which are standard in the industry to ensure that the communication methods used to support the MGM MIRAGE Web Sites do not permit connection or communication by methods that have known security weaknesses or vulnerabilities.  As such, if you experience trouble using an MGM MIRAGE Web Site, it may be an indication that you need to upgrade your Internet browsing tool or application to a newer version that supports more secure communication methods.     </p>

Therefore, the disclosure of Personal Information pursuant to this Policy is at your own risk.  We make no representation that the practices described in this Policy are compliant with laws outside of the United States that apply to the collection, security, use and disclosure of Personal Information. </p>
