<h3>MGSHAREWARE PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<h4>Policy Overview</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy pertains to the use of the “MGSHAREWARE” and "FreeRIP" web sites at http://www.MGShareware.com and http://www.freerip.com.  Except as provided in this statement, MGShareware will not disclose, sell or rent any personally identifiable information without the user’s proper consent.  The MGShareware user is given final word on whether or not to share such information with MGShareware.  Please use discretion, because MGShareware cannot be held accountable for the use, collection or distribution of personal information freely provided by users with any of our tools or services.  Be aware that information provided spontaneously by the user in such ways is not under the control of MGShareware and might be observed, collected or utilized by third-party agencies and organizations.  If you post your phone number in your profile (as an example) we cannot be held accountable for the consequences.  For questions or concerns about our information and policy practices, contact the MGShareware Policy Manager as provided at the end of this policy.</p>

<h4>Information Retention</h4>
<p>To preserve the integrity of website databases MGShareware procedure is to retain information submitted by users for an indefinite length of time.  By submitting information to MGShareware, you are consenting to store that information indefinitely.  If required by applicable federal or state law, such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA,) MGShareware will scramble and/or encrypt that information to make it unrecognizable.  MGShareware will also respond to written user requests to scramble account information.  If you wish to make such a request, which will require you to verify your identity, please contact the MGShareware Policy Manager.</p>
