	<strong>M-GO Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how M-GO collects, uses and shares the personal information that you provide to us as a user of the M-GO Service (the “M-GO Service”). It also provides information about our relationships with certain third parties that provide services in connection with the M-GO Service.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>The Information We Collect About You</strong></h3>
<p>We collect, hold, use and share different types of information about you in connection with your use of the M-GO Service, as described below:</p>
<h4>
	Account Data</h4>
<p>If you establish an M-GO account as an Account Creator (as defined in the License &amp; Terms of Service), we collect your email address, password and a confidential personal identification number (“pin”).&nbsp;&nbsp; When using the M-GO Service, the Account Creator may provide additional information, including name, zip code, and credit card information.&nbsp;&nbsp; We call all of this information “Account Data.”&nbsp; Account Creators may authorize other members of their households to use the M-GO Service as “Basic Users” by establishing unique profiles and confidential “pins” for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use the M-GO Service as a Basic User, you may provide additional Account Data (such as an email address) about yourself during your use of the M-GO Service. The Account Creator is responsible for the confidentiality of his or her account information and for restricting access to his or her M-GO account. &nbsp;If you choose to permit other people to access the M-GO Service through your account, you are responsible for their actions and their access to information regarding your M-GO account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>M-GO information, including Account, Usage, and User Feedback data (as defined below), is accessible to users accessing the same account, except that Basic Users cannot access or change the profiles or pins of the Account Creator or other users.</p>
<p>You may be permitted to use the M-GO Service on a trial basis without registering, but certain features of the M-GO Service may not be available to you. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	User Feedback Data</h4>
<p>You may choose to submit information during your use of the M-GO Service, such as watchlists, ratings and reviews that you decide to provide to us or post publicly; responses to questionnaires or surveys; your enrollment in contests or promotions.&nbsp; We call this User Feedback Data.&nbsp; We maintain this information to help us improve the M-GO Service.</p>
<h4>
	Usage Data</h4>
<p>So that we can understand how our users use our Service, we also record the choices that you make as you navigate through and select media content through the M-GO Service.&nbsp; We call this information “Usage Data,” and it includes information about your use of the M-GO Service and viewing habits, including: &nbsp;</p>
<ul class="rteindent1" style="list-style-type: disc;">
	<li>
		Details about the media that you select, including the name of each media selection and the date and time that you watch or listen to it;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Start and stop times of features and media you use, including your use of media viewing features of the M-GO Service, such as fast forward, pause, rewind or record;</li>
	<li>
		If advertising or promotion is displayed, which advertisements or promotion you watch and whether you skip such advertisements or promotion, and</li>
	<li>
		Your viewing and purchasing preferences, including your use of the video-on-demand features of the M-GO Service;</li>
	<li>
		Your payment details, including amounts due and paid;</li>
	<li>
		Your IP address, to manage users’ media content rights, which may vary by country;</li>
	<li>
		Clickstream data reflecting the information you enter and the selections you make while using the M-GO Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect these categories of data to provide each of our users with a fulfilling experience and also to fulfill certain obligations to our content providers and device partners.&nbsp; Further, the data we collect helps us improve the quality of the M-GO Service by being able to provide content users desire, and by enhancing the features and functionality of the M-GO Service.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Automated Collection of Information</strong></h3>
<p>To record and manage your Usage Data, we automatically collect technical information about the device that you use to access the M-GO Service, IP address or device identifier, browser type and other system preferences, times and dates of your use of the M-GO Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Usage Data is stored directly on our servers as you interact with the M-GO Service.&nbsp; We also employ the following automated information collection technologies while you use the M-GO Service:&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Log Files</h4>
<p>We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp; This information includes IP addresses and device identifiers, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.&nbsp;&nbsp; IP addresses are used to validate media content rights that vary by country, since media content may be restricted to users accessing the content from certain countries.&nbsp; We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the M-GO Service, to track users’ navigation through the M-GO Service, and to gather demographic information about our user community.&nbsp; We link this automatically-collected data to the other information that we maintain about you.&nbsp; This information is used to track which hardware platforms are used to access the M-GO Service, to activate media playing rights, and to provide customer service and technical support. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Cookies</h4>
<p>The M-GO Service uses a tracking technology called cookies.&nbsp; A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your device to record information about your activities and preference settings on a website or other online service platform.&nbsp;&nbsp; We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; A session cookie expires when you close your browser.&nbsp; We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate through the M-GO Service. A persistent cookie remains on your device for an extended period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persistent cookies enable us to personalize your experience when using the M-GO Service by remembering your interests and preferences from past sessions.&nbsp; You can set your Internet browser to warn you before a cookie is set, or you can refuse to accept cookies.&nbsp; You may also delete persistent cookies by adjusting your browser settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your browser permits you to refuse cookies, and you reject or delete cookies, you may still use the M-GO Service, but your ability to use some features will be limited.</p>
<h4>
	Flash Cookies</h4>
<p>We also use Local Shared Objects, which are also known as “flash cookies,” to administer the M-GO Service and to optimize the performance of certain media player software technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Flash cookies are set on your device to store media player preferences and settings so that you do not have to repeatedly enter your settings when you request media content.&nbsp; Disabling flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of media player software that you need to view media content that you select through the M-GO Service. For more information about flash cookies and instructions for disabling them, please go to http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html</p>
<h4>
	Clear Gifs (Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, or Web Bugs)</h4>
<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as pixel tags, web beacons, or web bugs), that help us better manage content available through our M-GO Service by measuring what content is of interest to our users.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the selections made by users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s device, clear gifs are embedded invisibly in images as they are displayed. Clear gifs can recognize certain types of information on your browser, record the IP address of your device, whether and when you view a web page or email message, and the address of the web page from which the clear gif was viewed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to other information we maintain about our users.&nbsp; We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.&nbsp; This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing efforts.&nbsp; If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choices Regarding Use and Sharing of Your Information.”</p>
<p>We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics, which uses cookies to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable log file information and information about users' navigation on the M-GO website. &nbsp;&nbsp;We use this information to perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses for product development purposes.&nbsp; Please go to <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en%5D">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en]</a> for information about how to opt out from this collection of information.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></h3>
<p>We combine the information that we collect about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy to create an individually identifiable profile of your activity relating to your use of the M-GO Service and the media content that you choose.</p>
<p>We use your payment information, such as your credit card number, through our payment processor contractor, to complete transactions and to fulfill requests that you initiate, and to prevent fraud and abuse of the M-GO Service.&nbsp; Credit card data is handled in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI”) at https://pcisecuritystandards.org, and any amendments or restatements of the PCI.</p>
<p>We use the other information we collect about you in order to manage your account and to provide and improve the M-GO Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; These uses of your information include: &nbsp;</p>
<ul class="rteindent1" style="list-style-type: disc;">
	<li>
		Contacting you in response to your requests, to manage your account information, or send you essential information regarding the M-GO Service;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Fulfilling your requests for media content, M-GO Services or products available through the M-GO Service;</li>
	<li>
		Conducting research or analyses of user behavior to improve the M-GO Service;</li>
	<li>
		Generating aggregate data and usage statistics, which may be combined with data from other sources, to monitor and improve the M-GO Service and to conduct advertising and marketing activities;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Conducting data analytics, including analysis of user behavior to improve the M-GO Service;</li>
	<li>
		Managing and administering the M-GO Service, including account management, billing and collections activities;</li>
	<li>
		Complying with legal and/or regulatory requirements, to protect and/or enforce our rights or the rights or safety of third parties; to comply with our obligations and commitments to safeguard the privacy and security of your information and/or to deter and prevent fraud or crime;</li>
	<li>
		Preventing unauthorized, improper or illegal activities on the M-GO Service; and</li>
	<li>
		Other uses permitted under our License &amp; Terms of Service or as otherwise described at the time we collect information from you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	<strong>Personalization of the M-GO Service&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Your information enables us to personalize the M-GO Service for you, so that you receive recommendations, prioritized search results, and other personalization of the M-GO Service that best matches your interests and preferences.&nbsp; For example, we use Usage Data to record your media interests, which we use to display media or promotions that are more likely to be of interest to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also may use cookies and similar technologies to compile aggregate data.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if we send you promotional information about an M-GO Service or feature, your information enables us to tailor the materials we provide to cover topics that are more likely to be of interest to you, based on your demographic information, location, or prior online activities and preferences. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Promotional Communications</strong></h3>
<p>We may use your information to send you promotional or marketing information relating to the M-GO Service or our other products or services that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also use your information to send you information or offers on behalf of our sponsors and advertisers.&nbsp; You may make choices about promotional communications by opting out of such email messages. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We also use your information to select and provide you with direct marketing materials (by mail, telephone, email, SMS or any other means for which you have provided contact details) about products, services, special offers and other news from us or selected third parties.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>How We Share Your Information</strong></h3>
<p>We may share your information (for the purposes described above) with:</p>
<h4>
	Third Parties That You Authorize</h4>
<p>We may share your information in accordance with your consent given at the time a disclosure is sought.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Our Service Providers</h4>
<p>We use third parties engaged by us as contractors, licensors, or services providers for purposes of order fulfillment, request processing, or debt collection, such as providers of payment and transaction processing services; information technology and telecommunication services; hosting services; accounting, legal, collections, and consulting services; content providers, media delivery, and distribution services; or account management, or other business services.&nbsp; In the course of providing such services, these service providers may have access to your information.&nbsp; We do not authorize these service providers to use or disclose your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them.&nbsp; We require these service providers to contractually agree that they are prohibited from using your personal information for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law.&nbsp; We require our payment processor contractor to handle credit card data in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI”) at https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/, and any amendments or restatements of the PCI.</p>
<p>Subject to your right to opt out and applicable legal and regulatory limitations, (1) we may disclose identifiable information about you, without identifying the title, description, or subject matter of media content that you use through the M-GO Service, to other third parties, including without limitation, our advertising, marketing, and business analytics service providers, and (2) we may also share the subject matter, or genre, of the media content you select exclusively for marketing goods and services directly to you.</p>
<h4>
	Users of Aggregate Data</h4>
<p>Aggregate data is information that we generate from individualized information (such as statistics derived from your Usage Data) but subsequently maintain and use in aggregate form that combines information about numerous individuals together so that no individual can be identified, such as the number of users who viewed a particular program during a defined time period.&nbsp; We may disclose aggregated data derived from information about you to third parties that may or may not be affiliated with us.&nbsp;&nbsp; These disclosures may include reports on the number of users who view certain content during a certain time period, or the number of users who clicked on a certain advertisement or promotion.&nbsp; We do not request consent to disclose aggregated information, since it does not provide any information that can associated with any individual. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	In Connection with a Transaction or Business Reorganization</h4>
<p>If we transfer ownership of all or part of our business, or sell or transfer assets relating to the M-GO Service, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in a bankruptcy or similar reorganization proceeding, we will share your information as part of that transaction or proceeding.</p>
<h4>
	Other Third Parties</h4>
<p>We may disclose information about you (1) to a law enforcement agency pursuant to a federal or state warrant, a grand jury subpoena, or a court order, or (2) in a civil proceeding, pursuant to a court order and subject to applicable requirements, which may include a showing of compelling need for the information, advance notice, and an opportunity for you to appear and contest the claim of the person seeking the disclosure, or (3) subject to applicable legal and regulatory limitations, to comply with&nbsp; a request for cooperation by a government entity;&nbsp; to protect and/or enforce our rights or the rights or safety of third parties; to deter and prevent fraud or crime and for our risk management purposes; to comply with our obligations and commitments to safeguard the privacy and security of your information; to prevent unauthorized, improper or illegal activities on the M-GO Service; to enforce our License &amp; Terms of Service (or Terms of Service); as otherwise permitted under our License &amp; Terms of Service; or as specifically disclosed when we collect information from you.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you notify us that you believe your rights have been violated in connection with the M-GO Service or another user of the M-GO Service, we may disclose information about you to the extent necessary to evaluate and respond to your concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>

<p>When we display advertising on behalf of our sponsors and business partners, our advertisers (or their agency or partner) provide us with an advertisement and tell us characteristics of the audience they want to reach.&nbsp; We use the information we maintain about you to select advertisements that best fit your profile, location, preferences and interests.&nbsp; This practice of tailoring advertising is known as targeted or behavioral advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp; We display the advertisement to users that best meet the criteria provided by our advertiser. In this process, the advertiser does not obtain access to your account information.</p>
<p>The advertising that we display may enable our users to click through to other parts of the M-GO Service, or to third party sites and services.&nbsp; When you click on an advertisement that takes you away from the M-GO Service, you will interact with the third party whose products, sites or services are promoted.&nbsp; These third party advertisers may collect some information from you in accordance with their own privacy policies and the laws and regulations applicable to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you click on an ad displayed through the M-GO Service, the advertiser may collect the IP address associated with your device.&nbsp; These third parties may also use tracking technologies such as cookies or web beacons to collect information about you and your use of the M-GO Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not responsible for the privacy practices of advertisers, and we do not have access to or control the cookies that may be placed by third party advertisers.&nbsp; You should check the privacy policy of the advertiser whose website you visit to determine how it handles any information it separately collects from you.&nbsp; If the M-GO Service permits you to click through to an advertiser’s website, we may not provide a further warning that you are accessing another site or service subject to different privacy practices.</p>
<h4>
	Third Party Ad Networks</h4>
<p>The advertisements that appear on the M-GO Service may be delivered to you by Internet advertising companies called "ad networks" or "network advertisers."&nbsp; In order to deliver relevant ads to you and to track the effectiveness of ads, these companies may use cookies, web beacons, and other online tracking technologies to collect information about your use of the M-GO Service and other online activity after you click on the ad.&nbsp; The information maintained by ad networks about you may be used to display ads to you on other sites and services even when you are not using the M-GO Service.&nbsp; The information practices of these advertising companies are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These ad network operators may place cookies on your browser in order to serve relevant advertising to your device, by recording whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, to tailor ads to you if you have visited a particular site or service, and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements.</p>
<p>There are different ways to stop, or opt out of, targeted or behavioral advertising. &nbsp;If you wish to opt-out, please send an email to <a href="mailto:customerservice@mgo.com">help@mgo.com</a> and we will block this advertising or provide you with &nbsp;instructions for opting out through the companies that provide our advertising services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We share aggregate information with Internet advertising companies and advertisers, such as the number of people who clicked on an ad displayed on the M-GO Service. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Social Networking Services</strong></h3>
<p>You may authorize us to share information about your use of the M-GO Service on third-party social networks, such as Facebook, and you may be able to connect with third-party social networks through the M-GO Service.&nbsp; If you connect your M-GO account to a social networking service, you may be able to publish information about your use of the M-GO Service on the social network (such as comments, reviews or the media content that you like).&nbsp;&nbsp; Information that you choose to publish on a social network will be visible to users of that social network in accordance with the social network’s privacy policy.&nbsp; If you elect to share information about your media choices and your use of the M-GO Service with your social networks, we will send information about you to the social networking services that you designate, including Usage Data relating to your use of the M-GO Service.&nbsp; Since our sharing of information about certain media selections may be restricted by law, you may be asked to consent on an item-by-item basis for us to share information about your media selections with social networks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The collection, use, and disclosure of information by the social networking service will be subject to the privacy policy applicable to that service. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	<strong>How We Handle Information About Children&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The M-GO Service is a general audience service that is open only to users 13 years of age and older.&nbsp; The M-GO Service does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Surveys and Contests</strong></h3>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys through the M-GO Service.&nbsp; If you request to participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.&nbsp; The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information.&nbsp; We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), to send participants an email newsletter.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and an opportunity to prevent such disclosures.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Links to Other Services or Sites</strong></h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the M-GO Service.&nbsp; The M-GO Service provides links to other services and sites that we do not own or control. Please be aware that even if these sites or services are co-branded with our name or logo, we are not responsible for their privacy practices.&nbsp; We encourage you to be aware when you leave the M-GO Service and to read the privacy statements of each and every site or service that collects personally identifiable information to determine how it handles any information it collects from you.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>How Long We Retain Your Information</strong></h3>
<p>We do not intend to retain personal or sensitive information for longer than it is needed in connection with the M-GO Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will generally retain your information for a short reasonable period of time after you close your M-GO account, subject to longer periods that may be required for certain information under specific contractual or legal requirements that are applicable to us.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	<strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></h3>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We use physical, technical, and organizational measures to protect information that we maintain about you against loss, destruction, damage, theft, or unauthorized or unlawful access, processing, disclosure, or alteration.&nbsp; Passwords are encrypted in transit and in storage using industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL) technology.&nbsp; We do not retain billing and payment information on our servers.&nbsp; We authorize access to your information only to persons who have a business reason to handle the information.&nbsp; However, no method of transmission of information over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.&nbsp; Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Choices Regarding Uses and Sharing of Your Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>You can select whether to receive promotional and marketing materials from us.&nbsp;&nbsp; These materials may be about our M-GO Services or products and services offered by third parties on whose behalf we send information.&nbsp; You may opt out of newsletters and promotional offerings from us by sending your request in any of the ways described below under “Contact Us,” or by following the opt out instructions provided in a promotional message from us.&nbsp; While you are a registered user of the M-GO Service, however, you will continue to receive administrative messages, service announcements and notices concerning your account or the status of your requests and transactions relating to the M-GO Service.</p>
<p>If you do not want the M-GO Service to share your personally identifiable information with third parties (except for disclosures that are made in the ordinary course of our business for order fulfillment, request processing, debt collection, and transfer of ownership), you may opt out as instructed on the M-GO website and/or your device or by contacting us in any of the ways described below under “Contact Us.”</p>
<h3>
	<strong>How To View or Change Information that We Maintain About You</strong></h3>
<p>To view, amend, or delete information associated with your account, you may contact us in one of the ways listed below under “Contact Us” with an explanation of your request.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can consider corrections to or deletions of this information, but may be unable to make requested changes.&nbsp; Please note that our ability to delete information is subject to contractual and legal obligations to retain information relating to our distribution partners or media content partners for a certain period of time, or other requirements that are applicable to us.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></h3>
<p>Standards and regulations relating to information privacy are subject to change.&nbsp; From time to time, we may change this privacy policy to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes.
