<div class="longtext">
<p>MetaQuotes Software is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains data 
collection and use practices of the MQL4.COM site (the “Site”); it does not apply to other online or 
offline MetaQuotes Software sites, products or services. By accessing the Site, you are consenting 
to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.</p>

<h2>Collection of your Personal Information</h2>

<p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) 
or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry out a transaction that you have requested

<p>The Site may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service 
provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time 
you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site
from which you linked directly to our site. This information is used to help improve the site, analyze trends 
and administer the site. Some of our sites collect information about your hardware and software in order to 
provide a requested service.</p>

<p>MetaQuotes Software technical communities provide opportunities to interact with MetaQuotes Software employees, 
experts, and your peers in order to share knowledge and news about MetaQuotes Software products and related technologies. 
In order to avoid your e-mail address or other personal information from being gathered and used by others for 
inappropriate or harmful purposes, MetaQuotes Software advises that you should be cautious about posting a real e-mail 
address or other personal information to newsgroups, chats, or other public forums. Read more about guidelines 
for safe use of MetaQuotes Software technical communities.</p>

<h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2>

<p>The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) 
or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.</p>

<p>In support of these uses, MetaQuotes Software may use personal information to provide you with more effective 
customer service, to improve the Site and any related MetaQuotes Software products or services, and to make the 
Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing 
the Site to your particular preference or interests. In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your 
interactions with MetaQuotes Software, information collected by the Site may be combined with information collected by 
other MetaQuotes Software services.</p>

<p>We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service 
that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may 
send you information about other MetaQuotes Software products and services, and/or share information with 
MetaQuotes Software partners so they may send you information about their products and services.</p>

<p>We merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use 
this information in aggregate to provide more relevant content. In some limited-entry sections of the Site, 
with your approval, we will combine site-visitation data with your personal information in order to provide 
you with personalized content. If you decline permission, we will not provide you with the personalized service 
neither merge your personal information with site-visitation data.</p>

<p>When you sign up for a newsletter or agree to receive promotional e-mails, the Site may use customized 
links or similar technologies to track e-mail links that you click. We may associate that information with 
your personal information in order to provide you with more focused e-mail communications or purchase information. 
Each e-mail communication includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication.</p>

<p>Some services on the Site offer individuals the ability to publicly display certain personal information, 
such as for a MetaQuotes Software partner who wishes to publish contact information as part of offering a 
business service. Participation in such services is always optional.</p>

<p>MetaQuotes Software occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as Web site 
hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, answering customer questions about products and services,
and sending information about our products, special offers, and other services. We will only provide those 
companies with the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the 
confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>

<p>MetaQuotes Software may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith 
belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal 
process served on MetaQuotes Software or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of MetaQuotes Software Corporation
and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of 
MetaQuotes Software employees or agents, users of MetaQuotes Software products or services, or members of the public.</p>

<h2>Control of your Personal Information</h2>

<p>Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on the Site will 
not be shared outside of MetaQuotes Software and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. 
As described below in the next section, you can access your personal information and make choices about 
how you wish to be contacted.</p>

<p>Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Site will not necessarily 
apply to personal information you may have provided to MetaQuotes Software in the context of other, separately 
operated, MetaQuotes Software products or services.</p>

<p>MQL4.COM may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service or security issues related to 
a product or service you requested, or confirming you requested a product or service. In some services 
offered by MQL.COMmunity, contact with the customer is an intrinsic part of the service. You will not be able 
to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service(s) you have chosen.</p>

visiting the MQL4.COM Profile Center. You will be asked to enter your login and password before
