              <p>Welcome to www.30MinuteBacklinks.com (the "Site").</p>
		      <p>We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially
		        when conducting business.<br>
		        This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users
		        of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without<br>
		        transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on the
		        Site and make use of the various services offered by www.30MinuteBacklinks.com
		        (collectively, "Services") ("Authorized Customers").</p>
		      <p>"Personally Identifiable Information"<br>
		        refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact,
		        or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not

		        profiles, social security number, and credit card information. Personally
		        Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected

		        the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Customers,
		        the nature and size of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising
		        inventory that the Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell.</p>
		      <p>What organizations are collecting the information?<br>
		        In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party service
		        vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may
		        provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect
		        this information from our Visitors and Authorized Customers. We do not control
		        how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose
		        how they use personal information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized
		        Customers. Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely
		        as links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the

		        our Visitors, including the demographics of our Visitors and Authorized
		        Customers, with our affiliated agencies and third party vendors. We also
		        offer the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving information or
		        being contacted by us or by any agency acting on our behalf.</p>

		        Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information
		        about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they select. We also
		        use Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorized Customers. For
		        example, if an Authorized Customer is logged on and the site is unused for
		        more than 10 minutes, we will automatically log the Authorized Customer
		        off.</p>

		        the Site, track a user's movement and use, and gather broad demographic
		        information.</p>
		      <p>What partners or service providers have access to Personally Identifiable
		        Information from Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on the Site?<br>
		        www.30MinuteBacklinks.com has entered into and will continue to enter into
		        partnerships and other affiliations with a number of vendors.<br>
		        Such vendors may have access to certain Personally Identifiable Information
		        on a need to know basis for evaluating Authorized Customers for service
		        eligibility.<br>
		        Our privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this information.<br>
		        Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law. We
		        will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to comply with
		        a court order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement agency to
		        release information. We will also disclose Personally Identifiable Information
		        when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of our Visitors and Authorized
		        Customers.</p>
		      <p>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?<br>
		        All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and practices.
		        The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and Authorized Customers
		        is only accessible to a limited number of qualified employees who are given
		        a password in order to gain access to the information. We audit our security
		        systems and processes on a regular basis. Sensitive information, such as
		        credit card numbers or social security numbers, is protected by encryption
		        protocols, in place to protect information sent over the Internet. While
		        we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic
		        communications and databases are subject to errors, tampering and break-ins,
		        and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not take place
		        and we will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such
		        occurrences.</p>
		      <p>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable Information?<br>
		        Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally Identifiable
		        Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by emailing us at
		        support AT 30 minute backlinks dot com</p>
		      <p>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information
		        collected by the Site?<br>
		        We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to delete/deactivate
		        Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database by contacting
		        support AT social media daily dot com. However, because of backups and records
		        of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining
		        some residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally
		        Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally
		        deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable
		        Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.</p>
		      <p>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?<br>
		        We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to
		        our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are
		        changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally
		        Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously
		        requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer
		        to allow such Visitor or Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure.</p>

		        This web site contains links to other web sites. Please note that when you
		        click on one of these links, you are moving to another web site. We encourage
		        you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy
