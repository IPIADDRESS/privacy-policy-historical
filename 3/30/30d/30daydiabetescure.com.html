<h3>BRAINSTORMS, INC PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>Brainstorms, Inc (“Brainstorms”) takes your privacy seriously. Earning  and maintaining your trust is important to us. We want you to understand  what information we gather from you, how this information is used and  protected, and what choices you have about how your information is used.  This Privacy Policy and Agreement (“Privacy Policy”) discloses the  privacy practices of the Brainstorms websites (including, but not  limited to, www.30daydiabetescure.com) (individually or  collectively, the “Website”). By using the Website, you agree, without  limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Policy. This  Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Brainstorms  online.</p>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, and therefore  encourage you to revisit this page periodically or when you notice new  features on the Website. Please know that any information you reveal in a  Website public forum (such as a message board, online meetings,  posting, chat room/event, or similar electronic public venues) is not  protected by this Privacy Policy. Such postings will be seen by Website  members and/or guests and third parties not related to Brainstorms. What  you write could be used by others in ways we are unable to control or  predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. Also, if  you access a third party website from a link on the Website, any  information you reveal on that site is not subject to this Privacy  Policy. You should consult the privacy policy of each website you visit.</p>
<h2>SECTION I</h2>
<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU</h3>
<h4>A. Information Collected by Brainstorms or on Behalf of Brainstorms</h4>
<p><strong>In General</strong></p>
<p>Brainstorms collects two kinds of information: (1) Personally  identifiable information (“Personal Information”) voluntarily provided  by visitors through optional registration or other methods and (2)  non-personally identifiable information routinely gathered as visitors  navigate through our Website.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>You are free to visit and use our Website without providing any Personal  Information. However, Brainstorms offers services on our Website that  require registration and/or submission of Personal Information. In order  to register or otherwise take advantage of the products and services  that we offer on our Website, you will have to provide Personal  Information. The Personal Information we might request from you may  include your name, address, e-mail address, phone number and, if you are  making a purchase of goods or services, your billing and credit card  information. Providing Brainstorms with your Personal Information is  strictly voluntary. By way of example only, some situations in which we  may request Personal Information include: when you register to become a  Member of our Website and/or when you update your Member Profile on our  Website; when you register to receive our informational Newsletter(s);  when you purchase a product or service from our Online Store; when you  enter a contest or promotion on our Website; when you participate in a  survey on our Website; or to when you wish to participate in one of our  interactive forums, including chat rooms or posting boards. The ways in  which we collect Personal Information are described in more details  below. In some cases, we must share your Personal Information in order  to fulfill your request(s). For example, we may use third party credit  card processing companies and shipping fulfillment companies to fulfill  your order. Additionally, from time to time we offer products or  services on our Websites that are provided by a third party. Also,  sometimes we offer contests and promotions with another party. If you do  not wish for us to share your Personal Information in this manner,  please do not place orders on our Website or participate in contests.</p>
<p><strong>Registration &amp; Member Profile</strong></p>
<p>In order to obtain access to certain products, services, and/or content  available on our Website (e.g., coupons), you must complete a  registration form. Our Registration Form and Member Profile pages  request that you submit the following information: your name, a username  and password, email address, mailing address, and zip code. We use the  Personal Information you provide through registration to bill you and  conduct other billing and account activity; and respond to any questions  that you submit. From time to time we might need to update you about  your account, contact you regarding a billing question, notify you about  changes to our services, or otherwise send you service-related  announcements. For example, if a service to which you have subscribed is  temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email to  notify you of the service suspension. Or, we may need to contact you  with respect to a billing matter. You will not be able to unsubscribe  from these transactional emails. You will be permitted to unsubscribe  from all other emails that are not transactional in nature.</p>
<p>In those circumstances, we will use your Personal Information to  contact to you. By registering for our services, you consent to  Brainstorms contacting you about your account. Based upon the Personal  Information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify  your username and password. If you do you not wish Brainstorms to  contact you regarding your account, please do not register on our  Website. You are of course free to unsubscribe to any other emails that  you receive from us.</p>
<p>See the section entitled “Your Privacy Choices” below for more  details about opting-out from non-transactional email subscriptions and  newsletters.</p>
<p><strong>Emails &amp; Newsletters</strong></p>
<p>You may register to receive email subscriptions and newsletters from  Brainstorms by visiting your Subscription Profile and opting in to  receive the subscriptions or newsletters of your choosing. To receive  emails and newsletters from Brainstorms you must provide your email  address. Brainstorms also offers a Diet Buddy ™ and “Tell a Friend”  (a.k.a. “Refer a Friend”) feature that enables you to send articles and  other content to your friends. When you use Brainstorms’s Diet Buddy™ or  “Tell a Friend” feature, we do not store your friend’s email address.  We use your friend’s email address only for the purpose of sending your  friend the article or content you requested and for no other purpose,  unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time you send the email.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys or Contests</strong></p>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in  contests, promotions or surveys on or through our Website. If you  participate, we will request certain Personal Information from you.  Participation in these contests, , or surveys is completely voluntary  and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this  information. The requested information typically includes contact  information (such as name, email, and/or shipping address), and  demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
<p>Sometimes we may offer these contests or, together with another  party, or we may use a third party service provider to help us conduct  the promotion. In order to administer the promotion and/or provide the  winner(s) with a prize, we may need to share your Personal Information  with a third party who is helping us conduct the promotion or  co-sponsoring the promotion with us. We will notify you within the  Official Rules of promotions if another party is co-sponsoring the  promotion with us. If we are using a third party service provider, the  third party service provider will be prohibited from using your Personal  Information for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Editorial/Interview Requests</strong></p>
<p>A member of the Brainstorms editorial team may contact members via  email, telephone or postal mail for potential interviews and feature  stories. Testimonials and Success Stories are effective tools in  communicating the quality and usefulness impact of Brainstorms products  and services.  Participation in editorial or interview requests is  strictly voluntary and you are free to refuse to participate. If you do  choose to participate, however, you should be aware that we may use your  name, likeness, statements, quotes, and other Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>Non-personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>You may use our Website without registering or submitting any Personal  Information. In that case, the only information we will collect from you  is general, aggregated, demographic, or other non-personal information.  We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies and log files  to track non-personal information about visitors to our Website in the  aggregate. We may also share non-personal information with third parties  such as advertisers and partners. This non-personal, aggregate data is  used to analyze trends, to track user movement around the Website, and  to gather demographic information about how members, subscribers, and/or  visitors use our Website.</p>
<p>In some cases, when you click on a link or an advertisement in an  email or newsletter you may receive from us, your browser may be  momentarily directed to the site of a third party which, acting on  Brainstorms’s behalf (see Section III, below), notes or “counts” your  response to the email or newsletter before re-directing your browser to  its proper destination. This re-direction process will not be apparent  to you. Your Personal Information will not be recorded by this third  party.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file stored on a user’s computer for  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on our Website to determine the  number of unique visitors, to personalize your online experience, to  identify returning visitors, and to provide you with advertisements and  messages of interest to you. Brainstorms does not store any Personal  Information in any cookies on your computer. However, we do link the  non-personal information we store in cookies to your Personal  Information.</p>
<p>Also, companies offering products or services through our Website may  use their own cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use and placement  of cookies by Brainstorms only, and does not cover the use or placement  of cookies by any third party.</p>
<p>Your browser may be set to reject all cookies. Most browsers offer  instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the “Help”  section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookie(s), you will be  restricted to certain free areas of our Website and will be unable to  access areas of the Website available to paid members. We also use a  third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our Web  site. This company may use non-personally identifiable information about  your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide  advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would  like more information about this practice and to know your choices  about not having this information used by this company click here:  http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>Our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called  clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us to validate sales  on our Website. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,  similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online  movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies which are stored on a  user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web  pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  We do not tie the non-personal information gathered by clear gifs to  your Personal Information, and we do not use web beacons to collect any  Personal Information from or about you or to track your activities  across websites generally.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically  and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol  (IP) addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system,  date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information (which  does not identify individual users) to analyze trends, to administer the  Website, and to identify and solve hardware and software problems as  they arise. We may link this automatically-collected data to your  Personal Information for the purpose of determining your interests and  to offer you goods or services that we believe may be of interest to  you.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking and Merging Information from Other Sources</strong></p>
<p>If you register on our Website and provide us with Personal  Information, we may link non-personal, aggregated tracking data with  your online Personal Information through use of cookies, log files and  other non-personal information collection.</p>
<p>We may also supplement the Personal Information we collect from you  with non-personal or personal information from other, third party  sources (e.g., Experian Information Solutions, Inc.). We will merge this  third party information with Personal Information you have provided to  us. The composite information about you will be treated in accordance  with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We perform this tracking and merging to assist us in evaluating and  improving our Website, products, and services; to determine your  preferences so that we can tailor our Website, products, and services to  your needs; to provide you with targeted marketing offers that we think  may be of interest to you; and/or to study nutritional, weight loss,  behavioral and fitness questions in general.</p>
<h4>B. Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on Behalf of Brainstorms</h4>
<p>Sponsors, partners or advertisers on the Website or in emails, special  promotions, or newsletters we send you may also use their own cookies or  web beacons when you click on their advertisement or link to their  website or service, or even if the advertisement simply appears on a  page or in an email that you are viewing.</p>
<p>We do not control third parties’ use of cookies or web beacons, or  how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them.  Please review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to  from our site to understand how these other sites use cookies and how  they use the information they collect through the use of cookies or web  beacons on their own sites.</p>
<h4>C. Children</h4>
<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. This Website is  not designed for, nor is it intended to attract, children under the age  of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information directly from  any person under the age of 13, and if we do inadvertently collect  information from a person under the age of 13, we delete it as soon as  we discover it.</p>
<h4>D. Public Forums</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, this Privacy Policy does not protect you when you  use Brainstorms public forums. As a service to our users, Brainstorms  features chat rooms and bulletin boards where users can share diet,  nutrition, and/or fitness information and support one another or post  questions for experts to answer. In addition, we offer online  discussions on a variety of topics moderated by experts. You should be  aware that any information shared in a chat room, bulletin board, or  online discussion is public information and may be seen, disclosed to,  or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy.  You should think carefully before disclosing any personal information in  any public forum.</p>
<h4>E. Emails to Brainstorms</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not protect you when you send business  information, ideas, concepts or inventions to Brainstorms by email to  the contacts listed on the “Contact Us” link on our Website. If you want  to keep business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or  proprietary, do not send them in an email to Brainstorms.</p>
<h2>SECTION II</h2>
<h3>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to  by you, Brainstorms will not disclose any Personal Information it  gathers from you on our Website without your prior permission. Except as  set forth herein, you will have the opportunity to opt-in to  Brainstorms sharing your Personal Information with third parties, and  you can withdraw your consent to Brainstorms sharing your information at  any time.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we must disclose your Personal Information to  third parties who help us administer our Website or our services. These  third parties are required to keep your information confidential and do  not use your information for any purpose other than the purpose under  which your information was collected. See Section II(C), Disclosure to  Outside Contractors for more information. Additionally, we offer the  goods or services of third parties in our Online Store, and in other  places on our Website. If you should make a purchase, we will have to  disclose your information to these third parties so that your order can  be placed and processed. See Section II(D), Disclosure to Third Party  Sellers for more information. We also disclose your information to our  Affiliates (defined below).</p>
<p>We may also release Personal Information to third parties: (1) to  comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search  warrant, subpoena, court order, or legal process; or (2) in special  cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, or to protect the  rights and/or property of Brainstorms. Additionally, in the unlikely  event that the entirety of our business is sold, liquidated, merged, or  transferred to a third party, we may transfer all personal and  non-personal information to the party purchasing or merging with us. See  Section II(G), Other Disclosures for more information.</p>
<h4>A. Disclosure to Brainstorms Affiliates</h4>
<p>We may disclose information (including Personal Information) about you  to our Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Affiliates”  means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is  controlled by or is under common control with Brainstorms, whether by  ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide  to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with  the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>B. Disclosure to Third Parties Generally</h4>
<p>Occasionally we may invite you to be contacted by third parties whose  goods or services may be of interest to you. We will only share your  Personal Information with these third parties if you grant us permission  to do so. If you opt-in to such sharing, we may also share your  Personal Information with licensors of certain diet, nutrition, and/or  health-related programs offered on or through our Website. We may  provide third parties with non-personal information about you that does  not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such  information is combined with similar information of other users of our  Website. For example, we provide our advertisers and other third parties  with aggregate, non-personal information about our Website users,  including the number of unique users who visit our Website, the  demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the  activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website.</p>
<h4>C. Disclosure to Outside Contractors</h4>
<p>We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers  (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and  products related to our Website, including but not limited to  maintaining an email suppression list as required by state and/or  federal law; hosting and maintaining our chat rooms; providing credit  card processing and shipping fulfillment; fraud screening; testing and  implementation of special; and developing applications for our Website  and email services. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited  access to information collected on our Website, including your Personal  Information, in the course of providing products or services to us.  Access to your Personal Information by these Outside Contractors is  limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside  Contractors to perform their limited function for us.</p>
<h4>D. Disclosure to Third Party Sellers</h4>
<p>Through our Website, you may be given the opportunity to purchase (or to  obtain more information) regarding certain content, products or  services which are sold through a person or company other than us or our  Affiliates (collectively, “Third Party Sellers”). In addition, if you  purchase a product or service through one of our co-branded stores  (rather than through our Online Store), you will likely be purchasing  the product through a Third Party Seller, not from us. We will attempt  to notify you when you are dealing with a Third Party Seller by opening a  new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our  Website. For example, if you see a phrase such as “powered by” or  “brought to you by” followed by the name of a person or company other  than Brainstorms, then you are likely on, or about to enter, a website  hosted or operated by a person or company other than us. Third Party  Sellers may request that you submit certain Personal Information (e.g.,  name and address for shipment purposes) to them in order to purchase  their products or services or to obtain additional information from  them. Alternatively, we may offer the products or services of these  Third Party Sellers in our Online Store or elsewhere through our  Website. If you should make a purchase of these products or services, we  will transmit your purchase data and your Personal Information to the  Third Party Seller so that the transaction can be processed.</p>
<p>If you do not wish for a Third Party Seller to have access to your  Personal Information, please do not make a purchase in our Online Store  (or elsewhere on our Website). By submitting the requested information,  you affirmatively consent to have that information shared with the Third  Party Seller. This information is used by the Third Party Seller and  may be subject to a different privacy policy. We do not otherwise share  or disclose your Personal Information to Third Party Sellers unless you  give us permission to do so.</p>
<h4>E. Disclosure to Linked Sites</h4>
<p>In addition to the third party websites that you may access as described  above, for your convenience there are links to websites operated by  companies other than Brainstorms (“Third Party Websites”) that are not  contractors who provide content or services through our Website. These  links may be found in advertisements, referenced within content, or  placed beside the names or logos of sponsors. Brainstorms does not  disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party Websites without  obtaining your consent. In addition, Brainstorms does not endorse and  is not responsible for the privacy practices of these websites. If you  choose to link to one of these Third party Websites, you should review  the privacy policy posted on the other site to understand how that Third  Party Website collects and uses your Personal Information.</p>
<h4>F. Other Disclosures</h4>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the  event of a sale, liquidation, merger, or other transfer of all or  substantially all of the assets of Brainstorms.

<h3>HOW 30DAYDIABETESCURE.COM HANDLES SECURITY</h3>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you  enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our  registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure  socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link  www.verisign.com.</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the  Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once  we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of  electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive  to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal  Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any  questions about security on our Website, please email us at  support@30daydiabetescure.com</p>
<h2>SECTION IV</h2>
<h3>YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES</h3>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use  Personal Information for the purposes described above or as otherwise  disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You may also  change your preference and “opt-out” of receiving voluntary,  non-transactional communications by changing that option in your Member  Profile and/or Subscription Profile feature of our Website, following  the directions provided in association with the communication, or by  contacting privacy@30daydiabetescure.com. You may also change your  mind as to whether Brainstorms may share your information with third  parties by changing the option in your Member Profile and/or  Subscription Profile, or sending an email to  privacy@30daydiabetescure.com.</p>
