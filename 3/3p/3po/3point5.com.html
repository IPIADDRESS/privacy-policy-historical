<p><i><b>3point5 is committed to protecting your privacy online.</b></i>
In order to fully understand your rights, please read this privacy
statement before using the 3point5 website (the "Site"), which
includes any Retail Management Module or 3point5 link from a
manufacturers site that is powered by 3point5.</p>
<h1><b>When does 3point5 collect personally identifiable information?</b></h1>
<p>3point5 gathers information from visitors in four ways: registration,
cookie technology, IP addresses and participation in the services
available on the Site.</p>
<p><b>Registration</b>. When you register at the Site, we collect
information, which allows us to identify you. The more information you
provide, the better we are able to customize our services and your
experience to suit your needs and preferences.</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b>. We use cookies to store and track your preferences to
provide you with a more customized experience. A cookie is a message
that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your
computer's hard drive. Most Internet sites use cookies. You can set your
browser preferences to reject all cookies but then you will not be able
to participate in most customized services and you may be required to
repeatedly type in certain information. Cookies make your experience
easier by saving preferences and passwords. We also use cookies that
contain no personal information at all. These cookies help us estimate
our web traffic, determine which areas of the Site are the most popular,
and deliver relevant messages.</p>
<p><b>IP Address</b>. We may also log IP addresses for the purpose of
systems administration or to report information in aggregate form to
third parties (e.g., how many visitors logged in to our Site). An IP
address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when
you use the Internet. When you visit a particular web page in the Site,
our servers log your IP address. We do not link your IP address to
anything personally identifiable.</p>
<h1><b>How is personally identifiable information used?</b></h1>
<p><b>Customized Look and Feel</b>. 3point5 gathers information to
provide you with an effortless experience. For instance, your personal
information enables us to greet you when you return to our Site and to
provide you with your specified preferences (e.g., Site look and feel
and preferred categories and content).</p>
<p><b>Email</b>. If you register with our Site, from time to time, we
may email you with informative messages about our services we believe
may be of interest to you.</p>
<h1><b>With whom does 3point5 share information?</b><b></b></h1>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>We will not disclose your personal information to third parties
except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service,
or under circumstances required by law. In addition, we will comply with
the request for your personal information from any law enforcement or
regulatory agency or when any applicable law, regulation, or legal
process requires it. We also may disclose aggregated data derived from
the information you and other visitors provide. Please keep in mind that
aggregate data is not traceable to you specifically.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that we do not control the privacy policies of
third party sites to which we provide links. If you click-through a link
on our Site and submit your information to another entity, you will be
subject to their own privacy policies. We assume no responsibility or
liability for these third party privacy policies.</p>
<h1><b>What are my options to control the use of personal information?</b></h1>
<p>Most browsers can be configured to reject cookies or alert you when
cookies are being sent. You may cancel your registration to 3point5
and/or request the removal of your personal information from our visitor
records by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@3point5.com">support@3point5.com</a>.
We will send an email to confirm your request. After you respond, we
will remove your information from our database. Residual information may
remain in our archives and records, but this information will not be
used for a commercial purpose. We reserve the right to maintain
information on registered visitors who have violated any of our policies
or who have had their access to the Site blocked.</p>
<h1><b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b></h1>
<p>You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal
information online in a public area, that information may be viewed and
used by others.</p>
<p>Please remember that you are solely responsible for maintaining the
secrecy of any password you use on the Site.</p>
<p><b>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</b>.</p>
<p>By using the Site, you accept this privacy statement. If you do not
agree with this privacy statement, do not use the Site. We reserve the
right to modify this privacy statement from time to time. Your continued
use of any portion of the Site, following notification or posting of
such changes, will constitute your acceptance of those changes.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about our specific policies, please
send an email to support@3point5.com</p>
