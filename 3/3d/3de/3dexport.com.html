<ol>
<li>Hi there, we’re 3DExport Ltd of 2033 Gateway PlaceSan Jose, CA 95110, United States (“<strong>3DExport</strong>”) and welcome to our privacy policy. This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you’re an 3DExport user or visitor to our Sites. It applies across WPexport, PSDexport and CGWorkr&nbsp;(the “<strong>Sites</strong>”).</li>
<li>When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘3DExport’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Sites.</li>
<li>If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re talking about the rules for using each of the Sites. The rules vary by product and each product makes them separately available and seeks consent to them separately to this policy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The type of personal information we collect</strong></p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p><strong>Cookies (not the type you eat!) and web analytics</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For more general information on cookies, see <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li>
<li>When you visit our Sites, there’s certain information that’s recorded which is generally anonymous information and does not reveal your identity. If you’re logged into your account some of this information could be associated with your account. We’re talking about the following kinds of details:
<ol>
<li>your IP&nbsp;address or proxy server IP address’;</li>
<li>the domain name you requested;</li>
<li>the name of your internet service provider is sometimes captured depending on the configuration of your ISP connection;</li>
<li>the date and time of your visit to the website;</li>
<li>the length of your session;</li>
<li>the pages which you have accessed;</li>
<li>the number of times you access our site within any month;</li>
<li>the file URL you look at&nbsp;and information relating to it;</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Information about children</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Our Sites are not suitable for children under the age of 16&nbsp;years, so if you are under 16&nbsp;we ask that you do not use our Sites or give us your personal information (if you are a young tech wiz, please direct your nearest responsible adult to use the Sites for you!).

</ol>
<p><strong>Information you make public or give to others</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you make your personal information available to other people, we can’t control or accept responsibility for the way they will use or manage that data. There are lots of ways that you can find yourself providing information to other people, like when you post a public message on a forum thread, share information via social media, or make contact with another user (such as a third party Author) whether via our Sites or directly via email. Before making your information publicly available or giving your information to anyone else, think carefully. If giving information to another user via our Sites, ask them how they will handle your information. If you’re sharing information via another website, check the privacy policy for that site to understand its information management practices as this privacy policy will not apply.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How long we keep your personal information</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>We retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to provide the services to you and others, and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your personal information or to provide you with the 3DExport services, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your 3DExport account. Please note that if you request the erasure&nbsp;of your personal information we will retain information from deleted accounts as necessary for our legitimate business interests, to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce the terms of service&nbsp;and take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>When we need to update this policy</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>We will need to change this policy from time to time in order to make sure it stays up to date with the latest legal requirements and any changes to our privacy management practices.</li>
<li>When we do change the policy, we’ll make sure to notify you about such changes, where required. A copy of the latest version of this policy will always be available on this page.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How you can contact us</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you have any questions about our privacy practices or the way in which we have been managing your personal information, please contact us via <a href="mailto:support@3dexport.com">support@3dexport.com</a>.</li>
<li>We’re really glad you made it to the end of the privacy policy, because knowing this stuff is the best way to understand how your personal information&nbsp;is used and how to best manage it!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If you’re a user or visitor in the European Economic Area these rights also apply to you:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>For the purposes of applicable EU data protection law (including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “<strong>GDPR</strong>”), we are a ‘data controller’ of your personal information.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How you can access your personal information</strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You are also entitled to ask us to port your personal information (i.e. to transfer in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, to you), to erase it, or restrict its processing. You also have rights to object to some processing that is based on our legitimate interests, such as profiling that we perform for the purposes of direct marketing, and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent as more fully described below.</li>
<li>These rights are limited in some situations – for example, we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal information. In some instances, this means that we may retain some data even if you withdraw your consent.</li>
<li>Where we require your personal information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship with you, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other cases, provision of requested personal information is optional.</li>
<li>If you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to data protection authorities. The relevant data protection authority will be the data protection authority of the country: (i) of your habitual residence; (ii) of your place of work; or (iii) in which you consider the alleged infringement has occurred.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Both personal information and personal data have the same meaning in the context of this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3DExport Privacy Policy v2, effective date 25 May 2018</strong></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
