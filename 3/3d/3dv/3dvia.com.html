				<p>For this purpose, DS carries out internal monitoring concerning the collection, storage and processing of Personal Data.

				<p>However, it is important for You to exercise caution to prevent unauthorised access to your Personal Data.

				<p>DS will undertake the necessary investigations and attempt to resolve any complaints concerning any utilisation or disclosure of Personal Data in infringement of the principles set out in this Privacy Policy. If the dispute cannot be resolved through DS internal procedures, You may then directly seize the local authorities in charge of personal data protection (e.g. the CNIL in France). </p>
				<p>Unauthorised access to Personal Data or the improper use of Personal Data may constitute offences under local law and under the regulations in force within each company in the DS group. </p>
