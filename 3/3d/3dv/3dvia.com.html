DS has also put in place security procedures such as controlled physical access, Internet firewalls, intrusion detection and network surveillance. In addition, DS takes the necessary steps (verification of your password and user login) to verify your identity before allowing You to access your Personal Data or your account.</p>
				<p>Since all Personal Data is confidential, access is limited to employees, contractors and agents of DS who have a need to know such data in carrying out their tasks. All of the persons who have access to your Personal Data are bound by a duty of confidentiality and subject to disciplinary sanctions if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
				<p>However, it is important for You to exercise caution to prevent unauthorised access to your Personal Data. You are responsible for the confidentiality of your password and information appearing on your account. Consequently, You must ensure that You log out of your session in the event of shared use of a computer.</p>

				<p>Although DS has put in place reasonable safeguards to protect Personal Data, we recognize that there is no method of transmitting or storing Personal Data that is completely secure.

				<p>DS will undertake the necessary investigations and attempt to resolve any complaints concerning any utilisation or disclosure of Personal Data in infringement of the principles set out in this Privacy Policy.
