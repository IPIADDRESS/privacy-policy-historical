                <h2>PERSONAL USER INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>The following information will be treated as your "Personal User Information": </p>
                <ul>
                	<li><strong>Contact Information</strong> (including name, address, email address, business address, telephone and fax number)</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Details</strong> (including birth date, race, gender, sexual orientation, ID card number and social security number)</li>
                    <li><strong>Internet Access and Use Information</strong> (including social network account user names, contacts, chat logs, email messages, search history and web browsing history) </li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Information</strong> (including payment card bank account numbers or passwords, credit card statements, or transaction histories) </li>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Information</strong> (including your purchase history and data relating to use of Services and Software provided by Qihoo 360) </li>

                    <li><strong>Photograph</strong> (if you share a photograph with us) </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>We collect the following information in two ways:</h2>
                <ul>
                	<li><strong>Information you give us</strong>. You may give us information in a variety of ways, including when you request technical support or customer service, register a product, or give us reviews or feedback. As an example, many of our Services and Software require you to sign up for a 360 Account. When you do, weoll ask you to submit certain Personal User Information, like your name, email address, and other contact information. If you want to take advantage of the communication tools we offer, the foregoing information may be publicly visible, including your name and photograph. </li>
                    <li><strong>Information we get from your use of our Services and Software</strong>. We may collect information about the Services and Software that you use and how you use them. This information may include, for instance, information about your device, details about your usage patterns, details about your Internet usage, computer files and risks such as malware, and information that may be included in a virus or malware sample that we collect from your computer for review.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device information</strong>. We may collect device-specific information, including your operating system version, system language, and IMEI number. </li>
                    <li><strong>Log information</strong>. When you use our Services and Software, we may automatically collect and store certain information on our servers related to your use of our website or Services and Software to help us improve the quality of our products and service. This may include:</li>
                    <li>The manner in which you use our website or Services and Software, including how frequently you install, use or uninstall our Software and its features.</li>
                    <li>IP address. </li>
                    <li>Information collected relating to installed programs scanned by Software features. The information uploaded onto our 360 cloud security center ("<strong>360 Cloud Security Center</strong>") servers for virus scanning include: file paths and MD5 checksums of the executable files, installed software names, package names, software signature certificates, and software URLs in conjunction with our filtering feature, which we apply to suspicious URLs when you use 360 Internet Protection (this information is processed with encryption).</li>
                    <li>URL information. URLs of websites that you visit will be uploaded to 360 Cloud Security Center servers for phishing and online fraud analysis. Any Personal User Information will be removed from the URLs before they are uploaded. The information is processed with encryption before the upload.</li>
                    <li>Information relating to upgrades and updates to Software, including the time of the upgrade and the version of the upgrade. </li>
                    <li><strong>Unique Serial numbers</strong>. When you use certain services, they might have a unique 360 serial number. This serial number and certain information about your installation (for example, the type of operating system on your device) may be sent to Qihoo 360 when you install or uninstall Software or when Software periodically contacts our servers, such as in a check for automatic updates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local storage</strong>. We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. Such information includes: user settings, file whitelist and blacklist used to accelerate file scanning. </li>
                    <li><strong>Error Log Uploading</strong>: Software will generate an error log and a DUMP file automatically when an unexpected error occurs or an application crashes. Software will upload the error log and the DUMP file to 360 Cloud Security Center as required to find out the reason that the error occurred or Software crashed and improve the quality of the product. Before uploading the error log and the DUMP file, Software will prompt you to agree to the upload. If you agree, Software will upload the error log and the DUMP file to 360 Cloud Security Center; and if you do not agree, Software will not upload the log. The error log is a record of Software errors and/or crashes. DUMP files are generated by the operating systems (e.g. Windows, Android, and iOS) when a program crashes, and contain the program execution status of the crash, including the time of crash and system information. They do not contain Personal User Information. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>USE OF PERSONAL USER INFORMATION</h2>
