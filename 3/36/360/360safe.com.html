You may give us      information in a variety of ways, including when you request technical      support or customer service, register a product, or give us reviews or      feedback. As an example, many of our Services and      Software require you to sign up for a 360 Account.  When you do, weoll ask you to submit      certain Personal User Information, like your name, email address, and      other contact information. If you want to take advantage of the communication      tools we offer, the foregoing information may be publicly visible, including      your name and photograph.  </li>

</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device information</strong>.  We may collect device-specific information, including your operating system version, system language, and IMEI number.  </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <ul type="circle">
    <li><strong>Log information</strong>.  When you use our Services and Software,       we may automatically collect and store certain information on our servers       related to your use of our website or Services and Software to help us       improve the quality of our products and service.  This may include:</li>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>The manner in which you use our website or Services and Software, including        how frequently you install, use or uninstall our Software and its features.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address. </li>
      <li>Information collected relating to installed programs scanned by Software features. The information uploaded onto our 360 cloud security center ("<a name="OLE_LINK9"></a><a name="OLE_LINK8"></a><a name="OLE_LINK7"><strong>360 Cloud Security Center</strong></a><strong>")</strong> servers for virus scanning include: file paths and MD5 checksums of the executable files, installed software names, package names, software signature certificates, and software URLs in conjunction with our filtering feature, which we apply to suspicious URLs when you use 360 Internet Protection (this information is processed with encryption).</li>
      <li>URL information. URLs of websites that you visit will be uploaded to 360 Cloud Security Center servers for phishing and online fraud analysis. Any Personal User Information will be removed from the URLs before they are uploaded. The information is processed with encryption before the upload.</li>

    <li><strong>Local storage</strong>.  We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. Such information includes: user settings, file whitelist and blacklist used to accelerate file scanning.   </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <ul type="circle">
    <li><strong>Error Log Uploading</strong>: Software will generate an error log       and a DUMP file automatically when an unexpected error occurs or an       application crashes. Software will upload the error log <a name="OLE_LINK11"></a><a name="OLE_LINK10">and the DUMP file</a> to 360 Cloud Security Center as       required to find out the reason that the error occurred or Software crashed       and improve the quality of the product. Before uploading the error log and       the DUMP file, Software will prompt you to agree to the upload. If you       agree, Software will upload the error log and the DUMP file to 360 Cloud Security       Center; and if you do not agree, Software will not upload the log. The       error log is a record of Software errors and/or crashes. DUMP files are generated       by the operating systems (e.g. Windows, Android, and iOS) when a program       crashes, and contain the program execution status of the crash, including       the time of crash and system information. They do not contain Personal       User Information. </li>
