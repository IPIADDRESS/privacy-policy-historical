                            <p>Under EU data protection law we are required to advise you on the legal basis for processing your personal data. For the most part, the processing of your personal information is based either on a) our legitimate interests related to us providing you services you have requested or otherwise your customer relationship with us, or b) your consent, where requested.</p>

                            <p>Where provided under applicable law, you may have the following rights:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Object to our processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on legitimate interest (or those of a third-party), and you want to object to processing on this ground, as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have a right to object where we are processing your personal data for the purposes of direct marketing or profiling. You can object at any time and we shall stop processing the information you have objected to, unless we can show compelling legitimate grounds to continue that processing.</li>

                                <li><strong>Access your personal data.</strong> If you make this kind of request and we hold personal data about you. We are required to provide you with information on it, including a description and copy of the personal data and why we are processing it. We will require you to prove your identity before granting access to your personal data. We will process your request within the timeframe required under the relevant law.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Request the transfer of your personal data.</strong> We will provide to you or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note, this right applies to the personal data you have provided to us; and if we use your personal data on the basis of consent or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>

                                <li><strong>Request erasure (deletion) of your personal data.</strong>  You have a right to ask us to delete or remove your data where you have successfully exercised your right to object (see above), or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Please note, we may be required to retain certain information by law and/or for our own legitimate business purpose. But when we do so, we will inform you</li>

                                <li><strong>Request correction</strong> or updating of your personal data. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Request the restriction of our processing</strong> of your personal data in some situations. If you request this, we can continue to store your personal data but are restricted from processing it while the restriction is in place.</li>

                                <li><strong>Withdraw your consent.</strong> Where you have provided your consent to our processing of your personal data you can withdraw your consent at any time. If you do withdraw consent, that will not affect the lawfulness of what we have done with your personal data before you withdrew consent.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Make a Complaint.</strong> We will do our best to resolve any complaint. However, if you feel we have not resolved your complaint, you have a right to make a complaint to your local data protection authority. For example, in the UK, the local data protection authority is the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank">UK Information Commissioner's Office.</a></li>

                            <p>In this Supplementary Information section, we explain some of terminology used in this Privacy Notice.</p>

                            <p><strong>“data controller”</strong> – the person or company that controls the purposes and means of processing personal data.</p>
                            <p><strong>"personal data"</strong> – any information that relates to you (or from which you can be identified).</p>
                            <p><strong>“personal information”</strong> – information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. “Personal information” excludes information that is lawfully made available from federal, state or local government records as well as de-identified or aggregated information.</p>
                            <p><strong>“processing”</strong> – means doing anything with data. For example, it includes collecting it, holding it, disclosing it and deleting it.</p>
                            <p><strong>“profiling”</strong> - using automated means to process personal data in order to work out certain things about people, like analysing or predicting their performance at work, reliability, economic situation, personal preferences, interests, behaviour, location or movements.</p>
                            <p><strong>"transfer"</strong> – sending personal information outside the European Economic Area (e.g. by storing it on equipment located outside the European Economic Area), or allowing someone from outside the European Economic Area to access the personal information.</p>
