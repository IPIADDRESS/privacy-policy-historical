<h1>360i Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
360i LLC ('360i'), a wholly owned subsidiary of Innovation Interactive Inc. ("Innovation Interactive"), values its users and their concerns about privacy. 360i engages in consistent information practices and uses reasonable commercial efforts to clearly disclose those practices. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is a part of that effort. The instances in which 360i collects, stores and uses information it obtains through your use of the 360i services ("Services") are specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy. Other services offered by Innovation Interactive and its other subsidiaries are governed by other privacy policies. This Privacy Policy may be part of the terms and conditions or End User License Agreement ("EULA") to which you agreed. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</strong><br>
This Privacy Policy applies to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by 360i through your use of the Services. If there are any exceptions, we will clearly disclose them prior to collecting any information, and will give you an opportunity to choose not to participate or provide the information. By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we outline in this Privacy Policy. 360i may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post any changes here so that you are always informed of the information we collect, how we use it, and the circumstances under which we disclose it. Please be aware that the Services may provide links to Web sites operated by third parties, and also provide search results and similar services to third parties for display on their own Web sites or applications. 
</p>
<p>
360i is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of third party Web sites or applications, including the third party search engines to which your information is submitted. Also, please be aware if ads are displayed through the use of the Services, they may provided by third parties, which may collect cookies as part of the process of serving those ads. These cookies are typically used for the purpose of tracking performance of the ads. 360i does not determine which information those third parties will collect. Please see the paragraph below regarding Third Party Ads. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Ads.</strong><br>
360i and its clients may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site and our client’s web sites.  This third-party advertising technology uses information about your visits to this Web Site and our client’s web sites.  In the course of serving our ads, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser.  In addition, we may use web beacons provided by our third-party advertising company to help manage our online advertising.  These web beacons enable us to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this site and to learn which banners bring users to our Web site.  To learn more about third party advertising companies, cookies and how to “opt-out”, please click here:  <a href="www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>What information does 360i collect and use and what ways (if any) does 360i share this information with third parties?</strong></p>
<p>
360i may collect any or all of the following types of information: (a) traffic or clickstream data, (b) cookies, (c) Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, or (d) contact information and other personally identifying information. 360i's collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data.</strong>  Data about traffic and usage, including keywords, search results, bids, time of search, time of click, browser type and default language setting, is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. 360i may share information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in anonymous form. Importantly, all information collected from a search query is recorded on a non-personally identifiable basis and is kept anonymous. 360i collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) users access. For example, 360i's servers collect about the most frequently searched terms to help provide the most relevant search results, information about usage to check for fraudulent behavior or other abnormalities and to ensure that our Services are technically superior. In addition to the foregoing applications, 360i uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design and market the Services. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>(b) Cookies.</strong> Like many companies, 360i collects information about online behavior using cookies. In order to provide search engine optimization services through the Services, 360i places tracking tags on your web site. If 360i is providing you with search optimization services, 360i tracks usage of your web site through cookies. These cookies contain identification information that enables us to offer you the most relevant advertisements and other content. Cookies let us know about repeat visitors and if we are delivering quality products and services. 360i may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from, so that we can place more of our online advertising on these sites, and can, where necessary, pay our affiliates and other business partners. To 360i, using information within cookies is an anonymous way to survey how we are doing and to look for ways to improve the value of the Services to you. You may set your browser software to reject cookies, but you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services. 360i may share information about usage of the Services with third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form, including to report the results of advertising campaigns to advertisers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>(c) IP Addresses.</strong> An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer each time you connect to the Internet. When you use your web browser to request a web page from another computer on the Internet, your web browser automatically gives that computer your IP address so that the data you request can be sent to your computer. Through your IP address, 360i may track your Internet usage, including identifying your geographic location, which may be disclosed to advertisers, search engines and other partners. 360i may strip a portion of numbers from your IP address and provide such information to our third-party advertising companies. This information collected by 360i though your IP address is not personally identifiable. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>(d) Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information.</strong>  360i can obtain access to your name, e-mail address, physical address, telephone number, fax number, credit card number and other contact or personally identifiable information when you: (1) become an advertiser with 360i; or (2) provide comments, submit a problem, or request information from 360i.. 
</p>
<p>
When you become an advertiser with 360i, your contact information is used for billing, marketing and customer care purposes as well as for the purpose of approving and enabling your participation in the Services. Contact information specifically provided in connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests. This contact information is only provided to a third party if necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request. When you elect to use our search engine marketing services, your keywords and other search engine placement criteria are provided to the subject search engines 
</p>
<p>
360i may also disclose the information it collects in aggregated and non-personally identifiable form to promote and market the Services. 
</p>
<p>
360i employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting and other technical services. To perform those functions, it may be necessary for these parties to obtain access to 360i's servers that may contain personally identifying information. These parties are bound by appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 360i may also disclose personally identifiable information to its independent auditors, consultants and attorneys, all of whom are obliged to keep such information confidential 
</p>
<p>
360i may also disclose the information it collects if required by law or to comply with a government agency request. In addition, as companies grow and change, we may buy and sell companies, subsidiaries and assets. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business asset. In the event that 360i is acquired, you information may be one of the transferred assets. 
</p>
<p>
Is data stored by 360i secure?<br>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, 360i has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online. However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You should consider any communication that you transmit to 360i (such as data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that 360i will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient. </p>
<p>
Does 360i collect personally identifying information from or about children? 360i uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose individually identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The Services are not targeted at children, and children may not register for any portions of the Services that require registration. 
</p>
<p>
How can I access or correct any personally identifying information about me?<br>
To request a copy of the personally identifiable information you have sent to 360i, please send an e-mail containing your request to privacy@360i.com. You must provide your full name and the e-mail from which the request is received (and to which the response will be sent) must match the e-mail on file with 360i. You may then correct or delete such information using the procedures specified in the e-mail 
</p>
