Privacy Policy</a></span>
</h2>
<div class="PostContent">
<p>360Amigo, LTD’s privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) covers the  collection and use of personal information (“Personal Information”) that  we may gather any time you interact with us, such as when you visit our  Web site, purchase 360Amigo products, or when you contact our customer  support or sales departments. This policy describes our data privacy  practices, including what type of information is gathered, how 360Amigo  uses the information, and how we safeguard your Personal Information.</p>
<p>At 360Amigo, protecting your privacy is important to us. After all,  online privacy and security is what we’re all about. You expressly  consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this  Privacy Policy. Personal Information may be processed by 360Amigo in  the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including  the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may  be less stringent.</p>
<h2>Why 360Amigo Collects Personal Information</h2>
<p>360Amigo only collects your Personal Information where it is required  to provide you the best services and products available. By maintaining  an accurate customer database, we are able to send notifications via  e-mail to keep you informed about the status of your orders or accounts  and to provide updates and technical notices. These messages are  essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality  of our products and services.</p>
<h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
<p>360Amigo collects your Personal Information at a variety of points,  including when you place an order, (which may require you to provide  personal information, including a credit card number, to our commerce  provider), register software, request services or take part in other  activities on our Web site. For example, we often ask for your Personal  Information when you are conferring with one of our customer support  technicians, downloading a new product or program update, registering  your software or purchasing a product. During these interactions we will  collect Personal Information relevant to your transacting with  360Amigo, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail  address, shipping address and credit card information along with  information about the 360Amigo products you own, such as the activation  code or key code, date of purchase and information relating to a support  issue. We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your  orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this  information to contact you. When you register, you will be provided with  an option to opt-out of receiving promotional information on our  products and services. Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide  us with your Personal Information, because such information may be  necessary for us to provide certain services, we may not be able to, or  may choose not to, make such services available to you.</p>
<h2>Regarding Children</h2>
<p>360Amigo does not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors who are under the age of 13.</p>
<h2>Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
<p>Following common e-commerce practices, 360Amigo uses “cookies” and  other technologies to collect non-personal data that enables us to  better understand and improve the usability, performance and  effectiveness of 360Amigo’s Web site, and for reporting purposes to  track sales. Cookies are unique text files sent to your browser and  stored on your computer. We do not store any personally identifiable  information with these cookies. Use of these third party cookies by our  tracking utility company or service providers is not governed by this  Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>If you do not want 360Amigo to send cookies to your browser, you can  set your browser options to reject cookies or notify you when a Web site  tries to put a cookie in your browser software. Rejecting cookies may  affect your ability to use some of our Web site services.</p>
<p>Additionally, 360Amigo gathers general information about visits to  our Web site and stores this information in log files. This information  is stored in anonymous profiles and is not associated with a user’s  account. This information includes the number of total visits to our Web  site, and which browser is used to view our Web site (including the  version number). No Personal Information is contained in this data. Our  current partners help us to track our website usage. No personally  identifiable information is collected. 360Amigo uses this information to  understand traffic and downloads on our Web site, enabling us to  improve the site, provide the best online experience possible and  improve our ability to serve our customers.</p>
<h2>Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>360Amigo is committed to protecting your privacy. 360Amigo will not,  under any circumstances, share, rent or sell your Personal Information  nor does 360Amigo trade or exchange mailing lists with any other  organization. Furthermore, 360Amigo only shares your Personal  Information with our contractors that assist us in our efforts to  fulfill our obligations to you, and then only with partners that commit  to adhere to the same level of commitment as 360Amigo to protect your  privacy and data. We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders  containing a physical medium, such as backup CDs. This company does not  retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any  other purposes.</p>
<p>360Amigo maintains this information; but we reserve the right to  disclose your Personal Information as required by law and when we  believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply  with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our  Website. If you choose to use our chat forum and require assistance,  and would like someone to follow-up with you, then you will be asked to  provide an email address. The email address is stored in “chat logs” by a  third party, but is not utilized in any way by them and remains our  information.</p>
<h2>360Amigo Affiliates</h2>
<p>360Amigo may share some or all of your Personal Information with a  parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies  under a common control (collectively, “affiliates”), in which case we  will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If our company  or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will  possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the  rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described  in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>How We Communicate with You</h2>
<p>360Amigo has an optional e-mail service for customers who wish to  periodically receive promotional information, such as general product,  service and 360Amigo news. Users can sign up for emails through one of  the following processes: (1) an online Purchase; (2) registering through  the full application; (3) registering through the trial application;  and (4) signing up on the 360Amigo website.</p>
<p>Customers are provided the option to opt-out within each e-mail. If  you no longer wish to receive 360Amigo communications, you may  “unsubscribe” from our mailing program at any time in the following  ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By clicking on the auto-unsubscribe link included in each e-mail</li>
<li>By contacting our technical support department at <a href="mailto:%20support@360Amigo.com">support@360Amigo.com</a></li>
<li>By sending an email to <a href="mailto:newsletter_unsubscribe@360Amigo.com">newsletter_unsubscribe@360Amigo.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We will then update our database and take reasonable measures so that  no further promotional correspondence should be sent to the e-mail  address. You may, however, still receive transactional messages.</p>
<h2>Surveys and Contests</h2>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate  in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request  certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in  these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have  a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested  information typically includes contact information (such as name and  email address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
<p>We use this information to monitor site traffic and personalize the site, and to notify contest winners and award prizes.<br>
We may continue to use a third party service provider to conduct these  surveys or contests; that company is prohibited from using our users’  personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not  share the personally identifiable information you provide through a  contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior  notice and choice.</p>
<h2>Transactional Messages</h2>
<p>360Amigo sends required notifications via e-mail to keep you informed  of the status of your orders or accounts and to provide updates and  technical notices. This service is used for messages that are important  for the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our  services. When you purchase or register a product online, we require an  e-mail address for completion of the transaction, which we will use for  these communications. In order to stop receiving these notifications,  please contact our technical support team at <a href="mailto:support@360Amigo.com">support@360Amigo.com</a>. You will be opted out of further communications within 10 business days.</p>
<h2>Ways to Update Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>360Amigo carefully maintains our customer database in an effort to  keep your Personal Information accurate for the purposes for which it is  used. It is your right to be able to update your Personal Information  as needed. You can correct out-of-date information, update information,  remove information, delete your Personal Information or review any  information previously provided to 360Amigo by <a title="http://www.360amigo.com/user/" href="http://www.360amigo.com/user/">http://www.360amigo.com/user/</a> or by contacting our support department at <a href="mailto:support@360Amigo.com">support@360Amigo.com</a>.  Changes will be implemented within 10 business days. Please note,  however, that we may retain certain information relating to software  licensing and your information may also be retained in our archives.  When contacting customer service, we will verify your identification  through the use of security questions before sharing any Personal  Information as it appears in our customer database.</p>
<h2>360Amigo’s Commitment to Data Security</h2>
<p>360Amigo has security measures in place, such as the following, to  protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your Personal  Information in our customer database. Personal Information provided to  360Amigo is stored in secure facilities with access restricted to  authorized personnel only. We have put in place a series of  access-control procedures required for retrieval of personal  information. The 360Amigo Web site is regularly tested for security  breaches to protect against unauthorized viewing of Personal  Information.</p>
<p>To provide secure credit card processing when ordering, orders placed  on our Web site are processed through a payment gateway which operates  under its own privacy policy.</p>
<p>360Amigo DOES NOT store credit card information. 360Amigo does not  handle financial transactions via the Web, so it has no need for  streaming encryption products. 360Amigo works with a third party to  serve as a trusted intermediary to handle e-commerce transactions with  our customers. Our commerce partner handles e-commerce on a secure  server which encrypts all of our customers’ personal information. To  learn more about how our commerce partners manages the privacy of  information in conjunction with these e-commerce transactions, please  see their complete Privacy Statement. If at any time you would like to  make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information  online, you may contact a support representative at <a href="mailto:sales@360Amigo.com">sales@360Amigo.com</a>.</p>
<p>Although we make good faith efforts to store the Personal Information  we collect in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to  unauthorized users, we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
<h2>Acceptance of this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>By using the Web site or any services provided through the Web site,  you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information as  described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy Revisions and Notifications</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes  to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem  appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we  use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so  please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this  policy, we will notify you here, and by means of a prominent notice on  our home page, posted 30 calendar days prior to implementing the change.</p>
