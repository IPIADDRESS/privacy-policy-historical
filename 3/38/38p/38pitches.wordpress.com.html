PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how and for what purposes your personal information is being collected, processed and used. We pledge that we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information will only be used in ways that are in compliance with this Privacy Policy. <strong>This Privacy Policy is only in effect for any web pages, e-mail lists, collective non user-specific information and collective personal information collected and/or owned on 38pitches.com’s and its affiliates’ (collectively, “38pitches.com,” “our,” or “we”) web sites, including but not limited to the </strong><a href="http://www.38pitches.com/"><strong>www.38pitches.com</strong></a><strong> web site, as well as any online features, services and/or programs offered by 38pitches.com (collectively, the “Web Site”). Your use of the Web Site is also governed by Terms and Conditions [see the link on the Home page]. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Please note that some of the information about yourself may be disclosed to WordPress.com. We encourage you to review and become familiar with the WordPress.com Privacy Policy (</strong><a href="http://www.automattic.com/privacy/"><strong>www.automattic.com/privacy/</strong></a><strong>) in order to understand your obligations with respect to the information that you submit to WordPress.com. If you have any questions regarding your personal information submitted to WordPress.com, you should contact WordPress.com at </strong><a href="http://www.wordpress.com/contact-support/"><strong>www.wordpress.com/contact-support/</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>We will make an effort to update this web page with any changes to this Privacy Policy and you are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy frequently (the date of the most recent revision to this Privacy Policy appears at the end of this Privacy Policy).</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>
<p>Information collected by 38pitches.com is used for three main purposes. First, we collect information to improve the Web Site by determining which of our areas, features and forums are most popular. Second, we collect information to personalize the experience of the users of the Web Site. Finally, we collect information to enable our users to participate in features, services, programs and/or other activities from time to time.</p>
<p>You should understand that any information that you post to the Web Site, for any purpose and no matter of what nature or what medium or format, is considered to be a public disclosure and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Your UserID and the information that you deliver or post to the Web Site are included in your posts and submissions, but only to the extent that you affirmatively transmit such information. You should be aware that whenever you voluntarily post information to any public forum, whether on the Web Site or otherwise, the information that you post can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications of any form.</p>
<p>38pitches.com does not use its users email address or other personally identifiable information for commercial or marketing purposes without your consent or except as part of a program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. That being said, 38pitches.com may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes, for example to contact you.</p>
<p>In order to participate in many features, services and/or programs of the Web Site, we may require that you provide us with certain specific information, such as your full name, company information, mailing address, telephone number, e mail address, gender, personal interests and/or other information specific to you. You can choose whether or not to provide us with this information, but if you choose not to provide any required information, your experience on the Web Site may be diminished and some features may not be available or may not work as intended.</p>
<p>38pitches.com or a partner may sponsor promotions, sweepstakes or contests on the Web Site. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. 38pitches.com may also transfer personal information to certain advertising or marketing partners from whom you have requested to receive information.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Ways that Information is Collected</strong></p>
<p><strong>Browser Log Files</strong></p>
<p>Our servers automatically log each visitor to the Web Site and collect and record certain information about each visitor. This information includes your “Internet Protocol”, or IP, address, browser language, browser type, operating system, domain names, browsing history (including time spent at a domain, time and date of your visit), referring/exit web pages and URLs, and number of clicks.</p>
<p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer’s IP address. When a user requests a web page from the Web Site, our web servers automatically recognize that user’s domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about the user other than the IP address from which the user has accessed the Web Site. We may use this information to examine our traffic in the aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of users.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, 38pitches.com and/or our advertisers may send a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie, by itself, cannot read data from your hard disk or read cookie files created by other web sites. A cookie, by itself, does not damage your system. We may use cookies to identify and keep track of, among other things, those areas of the Web Site and third party web sites that you have visited in the past in order to enhance your next visit to the Web Site. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times that you have seen an advertisement. We and our advertisers may use this information to better personalize the content, banners and promotions that you see on the Web Site. You can choose whether or not to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. If you choose not to accept cookies, your experience on the Web Site may be diminished and some features may not be available or may not work as intended.</p>
<p><strong>When Information Is Disclosed By 38pitches.com</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the other times or occasions on which we might disclose information about users of the Web Site, we might also disclose information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a legal process and applicable laws; (b) enforce this Privacy Policy; (c) respond to claims that any materials, documents, images, graphics, logos, designs, audio, video and any other information provided from or on the Web Site violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of 38pitches.com, its users or the public.</p>
<p>We use reasonable precautions to keep the information that is disclosed to us secure. We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>

<p>We also reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information in connection with the enforcement of our Terms and Conditions [see the link on the Home page], take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the Web Site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 38pitches.com, our users or others.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information, as well as any other information, in connection with the sale or other disposition of all or part of the 38pitches.com business and/or assets.

The Web Site also links to a wide variety of other web sites and the Web Site may contain advertisements of third parties.
