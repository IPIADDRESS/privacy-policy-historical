<p>This version in effect since November 20, 2004
</p>
<p>Protecting your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and disclose the personal information you may provide while using The Keg website (the "Website"). It is always your choice whether or not to provide personal information through the Website. Any personal information you provide will be treated with care, and subject to this Privacy Policy will not be used or disclosed in ways to which you have not consented.
</p>
<ol>
 <li><p><strong>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</strong><br>Privacy Policy. Your access to and use of this Website is subject to the Website's Terms of Use, of which this Privacy Policy forms a part, and all applicable laws. Each of those provisions applies to any disputes that may arise in relation to this Privacy Policy or our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, and are of the same force and effect as if they had been reproduced directly in this Privacy Policy. By accessing and using this Website, you consent to the collection and use of information by us pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. We may in our absolute discretion at any time and without any notice to you or any other person revise the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy by posting an amended Privacy Policy on this Website. You should therefore periodically review this Privacy Policy and we recommend that you also print a copy of this Privacy Policy for your records. If this Privacy Policy is revised and you continue to access and use this Website, you will be deemed to have agreed to the then current Privacy Policy.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p><strong>What Information is Collected?</strong><br>Non-Identifiable Information. We are sensitive to your privacy concerns. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from you other than certain non-personal information which is recorded by the standard operation of our Internet servers such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the Website, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Website, the operating system you are using, the sections of the Website you visit, the Website pages read and images viewed, and any content you post to or download from the Website. This non-identifiable information is used for Website and system administration purposes and to improve the Website.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>When you view this Website, we store some information on your computer. This information will be stored in a "Cookie," which is a file created on your computer's hard drive, and will help us in many ways. For example, Cookies allow us to tailor the Website to better match your interests and preferences. With most Internet browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block the creation of Cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored, although doing so may affect your use of the Website and your ability to access certain features of the Website. Please refer to your browser instructions or the help section of your browser to learn more about these functions. Advertisements displayed on the Website may also contain Cookies or other technologies.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p><strong>Tracking Information</strong><br>We may use non-personal information to create aggregate tracking information reports regarding Website traffic patterns and uses, and then provide those reports to advertisers and others. None of the tracking information in the reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users. We also may link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by Website users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

We also collect personal payment option and related information from you when you complete and submit the online gift card order form.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p><strong>Use of Your Personal Information</strong><br>We may use your personal information to contact and correspond with you, to respond to your communications, to facilitate and enhance your use of the Website and as otherwise required or permitted by law. We also use the information you submit via the online gift card order form to service your purchase request.

 </li>
</ul>

 </li>

 <li><p><strong>Information Use, Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>Use of Information.
