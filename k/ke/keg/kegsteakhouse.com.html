            Protecting your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains 
            how we collect, use and disclose the personal information you may 
            provide while using the Keg website (the <strong>"Website"</strong>). 
            It is always your choice whether or not to provide personal information 
            through the Website. Any personal information you provide will be 
            treated with care, and subject to this Privacy Policy will not be 
            used or disclosed in ways to which you have not consented.<br>

            <strong>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</strong><br>
            <em>1. Privacy Policy.</em> Your access to and use of this Website 
            is subject to the Website's <a href="terms.html">Terms 
            of Use</a>, of which this Privacy Policy forms a part, and all applicable

            in relation to this Privacy Policy or our collection, use and disclosure 
            of your personal information, and are of the same force and effect 
            as if they had been reproduced directly in this Privacy Policy. By 
            accessing and using this Website, you consent to the collection and 
            use of information by us pursuant to the terms and conditions of this 
            Privacy Policy. We may in our absolute discretion at any time and 
            without any notice to you or any other person revise the terms and 
            conditions of this Privacy Policy by posting an amended Privacy Policy 
            on this Website. You should therefore periodically review this Privacy 
            Policy and we recommend that you also print a copy of this Privacy 
            Policy for your records. If this Privacy Policy is revised and you 
            continue to access and use this Website, you will be deemed to have 
            agreed to the then current Privacy Policy.</font></p>

            us in many ways. For example, Cookies allow us to tailor the Website 
            to better match your interests and preferences. With most Internet 
            browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block 
            the creation of Cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored, 
            although doing so may affect your use of the Website and your ability

            others. None of the tracking information in the reports can be connected 
            to the identities or other personal information of individual users. 
            We also may link tracking information with personal information voluntarily 
            provided by Website users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked
