<h1>Website Privacy Notice</h1><br>Our Privacy Notice is an important part of our commitment to provide you
 with the best financial and client service possible. We believe it is 
essential to clarify how KEMBA uses collected information, the benefits 
of such use and the way information is protected against unauthorized 
access and use. Your concern about the security of information relating

customer lists or individual customer information to any third parties.<br>
<br>
Each member relationship at KEMBA is built on trust. We have implemented

maintaining the privacy of your non-public, personal information. Our 
information gathering and dissemination practices for this site are 
described as follows. KEMBA automatically collects and stores the 
following information when you visit our website:<br>

<ul><li>Date and time your request was received</li><li>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, or the address of your Internet Service Provider (ISP)</li><li>Specific resource on KEMBA website that was accessed as a result of the request or application</li><li>Content of any sent or received cookie *</li></ul><br>
(* Some parts of the KEMBA website may use a "cookie," which is a file 
placed on your computer hard drive that allows the KEMBA server to log 
the pages you use in the KEMBA website to determine if you have visited 
the site before. It also stores your preferences and other information 
on your computer to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly 
enter the same information and to display your personalized content. No 
personal identifying information is captured by the cookie. This 
information is used by the KEMBA server to provide certain website 
features during your visit. You can set your browser to warn you when

may not function properly.)<br>
<br>
Other than the automatic data collection activity described above, this 
site collects no personally identifiable information. When you knowingly
 and voluntarily provide personal, non-public information, such as when 
you complete data fields on a loan application, you have chosen to make 
an exception to the automatic data collection as described.<br><br><strong>Information We Share</strong><br>We may share public and non-public personal information concerning your 
transactions and experience within KEMBA and related organizations. This
 sharing of information is intended to help us offer financial products 
and services we believe would benefit you and facilitate the servicing 
of your accounts. You have a choice as to whether or not you want this 
information shared with KEMBA-related organizations. If you prefer that 
we not share this information, you may opt out by writing to us at KEMBA
 Financial Credit Union, Attention: Compliance Officer, 555 Officenter 
Place, P.O. Box 307370, Gahanna, Ohio 43230. Please provide your name, 
address and account number(s).<br>

 	Other non-public personal information may be shared with service

delivering financial services and products to you on our behalf. 
Examples of such third-party service providers include check printers, 
data processors, deposit or loan account service providers, check 
verification services, and credit reporting agencies.<br><br>

 	Information we collect, as described above, may also be shared with
 companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or with other 
financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. 
This allows us to offer a variety of financial products and services we 
endorse and believe you may find beneficial. These companies we do 
business with agree to keep such information confidential and are 
prohibited from disclosing such information to anyone for any other 
purpose. We do not, and will not, share your information with

bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your 
accounts may be reflected in your credit report.<br><br><strong>Email Communications</strong><br>When you choose to identify yourself to KEMBA and provide an email 
address as an accepted communication channel, you are consenting to 
KEMBA using the information you provide, including personally 
identifying information, in accordance with this notice, unless you 
expressly state in the email your objection to any use(s). This may 
include the transmission of service communications such as welcome 
letters, billing reminders, technical service information and security 
announcements. Since general email is not secure and may be intercepted 
or viewed by others, you should refrain from sending confidential or 
private information via email.<br><br><strong>Information Security Standards</strong><br>KEMBA Financial Credit Union continually updates and improves our 
security standards and procedures to help protect against anyone gaining
 unauthorized access to your confidential information and to prevent 
fraud. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that 
comply with federal standards. Our associates have an appropriate level 
of access to your personal information in order to perform their jobs 
and provide you with the best financial products and services possible. 
We do work with law enforcement officials to pursue any individuals who 
either fraudulently access or attempt to access or use information. We 
are continually looking for new technology to further enhance the 
security of this information. Through appropriate checks and balances 
built into procedures</article>
