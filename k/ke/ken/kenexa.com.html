<p><a name="saas"></a><strong>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kenexa's Software as a Service (SaaS) Privacy Policy</strong> <br>
Kenexa provides our customers with applications that facilitate many Human Resource related requirements. These applications are not a part of our corporate web site. Kenexa serves as a Data Processor for the clients who use these applications. More specifically, Kenexa does not own the information that is submitted to our applications. The information that is submitted to our applications will be subject to our clients’ privacy policies.<br>
Kenexa complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. As part of our participation in the safe harbor, we have agreed to TRUSTe dispute resolution for disputes relating to our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework. If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor you should first contact us (as provided above). If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may raise your complaint with TRUSTe by Internet at <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=">http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=</a>, fax at 415-520-3420, or mail at Watchdog Complaints (<a href="http://www.truste.com/about_TRUSTe/contact_us.html">click for mailing address</a>). If you are faxing or mailing TRUSTe to lodge a complaint, you must include the following information: the name of company, the alleged privacy violation, your contact information, and whether you would like the particulars of your complaint shared with the company. For information about TRUSTe or the operation of TRUSTe's dispute resolution process, see <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=">http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=</a> or request this information from TRUSTe at any of the addresses listed above. The TRUSTe dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English. For human resources data we have agreed to cooperate with Data Protection Authorities. Any questions, comments or complaints about the data practices (including without limitation compliance with data privacy principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity, or enforcement) of a client for whom Kenexa processes data should be addressed to that client.</p>
<p>The following information discloses how information is submitted via our applications and how we handle the information for our clients who are the owners of this data.</p>
<p>Kenexa is a leading end-to-end provider of software, proprietary content, services and process outsourcing that enable organizations to more effectively recruit and retain employees. This SaaS Privacy Policy applies only to the transfer of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") received by Kenexa in any format through its hosted software, whether supplied directly by Kenexa customers or by employees or users of the hosted software anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>
Kenexa complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.&nbsp; Kenexa has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.&nbsp; To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Kenexa’s certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.&nbsp; . Accordingly, we operate as a data processor for our customers. Kenexa’s customers act as data controllers. Kenexa maintains only that Personal Information which its customers have asked it to process. This SaaS Privacy Policy does not reflect the privacy practices of Kenexa's customers and Kenexa is not responsible for its customers' privacy policies or practices. Kenexa does not review, comment upon or monitor its customers' privacy policies or their compliance with their respective privacy policies, nor does Kenexa review its customer’s instructions to determine whether they are in compliance with or conflict with the terms of a customer's published privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Notice/Use of Personal Information</strong><br>
Because it supplies a hosted system, Kenexa operates as a data processor for its customers. Kenexa’s customers act as data controllers. Individual users involved in employment activities may interact directly with Kenexa's customers rather than with Kenexa. Kenexa provides its customers with the option of disclosing their relationship with Kenexa by providing notice to individual employees and candidates of the customer regarding the Kenexa technology that they use. Kenexa maintains only that Personal Information which its customers have asked Kenexa to process. It is the Kenexa customer's responsibility to ensure that the data the customer collects can be legally collected in the country of origin. The Kenexa customer is responsible for giving its employees, applicants and users the appropriate level of notification that Personal Information is being collected and maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes/Choice</strong><br>
Kenexa will maintain Personal Information in accordance with this SaaS Privacy Policy. If Kenexa decides to change this Policy, Kenexa will post the changes on this page so our customers and/or their employees, applicants and users are aware of what Personal Information Kenexa processes, how Kenexa uses it, and under what circumstances, if any, Kenexa discloses it. If at any point Kenexa decides to retain or use Personal Information in a different manner, Kenexa will notify its customers by way of email or by posting a notice on Kenexa’s website for at least 30 days prior to the change in use. Customers, in turn, are responsible for their users and providing them a choice as to whether or not Kenexa uses their Personal Information in this revised manner.</p>
<p><strong>Onward Transfer</strong><br>
We are a global corporation with operations in several countries.&nbsp; We have developed global data practices designed to assure Personal Information is appropriately protected. While our primary data centers are in the USA, we may transfer Personal Information to Kenexa offices outside of the United States.&nbsp; In addition, we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.&nbsp; If we disclose Personal Information to a third party or to Kenexa employees outside of the United States, we will ensure that such party has agreed to abide by the Safe Harbor principles or is subject to the Data Directive, or can otherwise assure adequate protection of such Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>Data Integrity</strong><br>
Kenexa will use Personal Information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by our customers.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
Kenexa is committed to ensuring the security of the Personal Information that it processes. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Personal Information, Kenexa has adopted appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Information we process. Kenexa strives to protect the privacy of the Personal Information it processes, and inadvertent disclosure is unlikely. In the event of such an inadvertent disclosure, Kenexa will take all commercially reasonable steps to limit and remedy the disclosure. However, Kenexa cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those procedures or use Personal Information for improper purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Access/Correction </strong><br>
In most cases, when Kenexa collects Personal Information, it does so on behalf of another company (as an agent or data processor). To request access to, correction, amendment or deletion of this Personal Information, a user should contact the company to which the data was provided.</p>
<p><strong>Oversight/Enforcement</strong><br>
Kenexa has a Privacy Officer who is responsible for Kenexa's compliance with and enforcement of this Policy. Kenexa's Privacy Officer is available to any of its employees, customers, vendors, business partners, or others who may have questions concerning this Policy or data security practices. Kenexa's Privacy Officer may be contacted by email to <a href="mailto:Privacy@Kenexa.com">Privacy@Kenexa.com</a>.<br>
With regard to Personal Information, Kenexa has agreed to cooperate with Data Protection Authorities. Any questions, comments or complaints about the data practices (including, without limitation, compliance with data privacy principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity, or enforcement) of a hosted software customer for which Kenexa processes data should be addressed to that customer.</p>
<p><strong>IV. General</strong> <br>
<strong>Cookies and Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
We may use cookies to enhance a user’s experience while using our hosted software. Cookies are a small piece of data stored locally by your browser that saves information and helps identify you to web sites upon subsequent visits. Cookies are uniquely assigned to a computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie. Cookies generally assist users by performing certain functions such as saving passwords and personal preferences regarding the sites.<br>
You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact the use of the hosted software.<br>
Our hosted software may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites.</p>
<p><strong>Children's privacy</strong><br>
Kenexa&nbsp;is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. Kenexa does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and Kenexa does not target its website or its products to children under the age of 13.</p>
