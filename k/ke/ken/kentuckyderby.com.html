<p>CDI reserves the right to use your Personal Information in order to ensure that wagering activity on our sites meets various state and federal laws and other statutory requirements.  In addition, from time to time we may use your Personal Information to contact you regarding promotions and marketing offers and other purposes which are generally limited to our services.
