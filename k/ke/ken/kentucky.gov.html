<p class="text">Your privacy and security are our highest priority. Ensuring electronic 
  access to state government information and services while maintaining privacy 
  is a guiding principle of the state's <a href="http://www.state.ky.us/kirm/sitp/sitp.htm">Strategic Information 
  Technology Plan</a>. The Commonwealth of Kentucky collects only the personal 
  information necessary to provide enhanced services to our citizens and customers. 
  Please note that all non-exempt information collected by Kentucky.gov services 
  may be subject to public disclosure under KRS 61.870, the Kentucky Open Records 
  Act. However, public records containing information of a personal nature are 
  protected from disclosure by the personal privacy exemption of state law. Personal 
  data in our possession is maintained and used in ways that respect individual 
  privacy. The Commonwealth educates our employees about the importance of protecting 
  personal information and consumer privacy, and only authorized employees have 
  access to personal information.</p>
<p class="text">Depending on the situation, we may collect the following information 
  about visitors to our Web site: 
</p><ul>
  <li class="text">the domain name, but not the e-mail address 
  </li><li class="text">the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail 
  </li><li class="text">aggregate information about which pages consumers access or 
    visit 
  </li><li class="text">information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information 
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="text">This information is used only to improve the scope and content 
  of the state's services on the Internet.</p>
<p class="2ndtitlehd">Information Sharing</p>
<p class="text">Kentucky.gov will not release personal information to third parties 
  except where it is already provided by law for purposes of notification. We 
  will not provide, rent or sell personal information to third parties for marketing 
  programs or any other purpose. State law restricts the use of personally identifiable 
  information for commercial purposes. Depending on the specific nature of the 
  service, information may be shared with other state agencies as stated in <a href="http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/krs/061-00/878.pdf">KRS 61.878 
  (5)</a>. This statute allows for the exchange of public records or sharing of 
  information between public agencies when the exchange is serving a legitimate 
  governmental need or is necessary in the performance of a legitimate government 
  function.</p>
<p class="2ndtitlehd">Internet Cookies</p>
<p class="text">Cookies are short and simple text files stored on your computer 
  by internet web sites to help identify users and enhance customer service. Kentucky.gov 
  sites may use cookies to customize and personalize your service transactions 
  with state agencies. For example, our web shopping sites may use cookies to 
  keep track of customers and the contents of their shopping cart. In the event 
  the Internet connection is broken or you wish to suspend shopping and resume 
  at a later time, the cookie on your computer will maintain your computer's identity 
  shopping cart information. Cookies do not compromise your privacy or security. 
  Using web browser settings, you can refuse the cookies or delete the cookie 
  file from your computer by using any of the widely available methods.</p>
<p class="2ndtitlehd">Security Notice</p>
<p class="text">Kentucky.gov uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to safeguard 
  your sensitive personal information, including your credit card number, during 
  online transactions. Using this widely accepted form of encryption, your transaction 
  is secured from your personal computer to the Kentucky.gov computer processing 
  your request. The Kentucky.gov processing computers are located behind a secure 
  firewall. For your protection, never put your credit card number or other sensitive 
  information in unencrypted e-mail. For added security, your credit card information 
  is not stored on a state government database and only authorized employees have 
  access to your credit card number for card processing purposes.</p>
<p class="text">SSL is highly regarded to be a very safe encryption method, but 
  we fully understand if you are not comfortable entering your credit card information 
  online. In that event, please telephone the agency using the toll-free number 
  and speak directly to an agency representative.</p>
<p class="text">If you have trouble purchasing securely at our web site, then 
  you may be behind a firewall or using a proxy server that doesn't allow for 
  secure transactions. If that is the case, then you may phone or fax your order.</p>
