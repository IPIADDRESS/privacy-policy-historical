<p>Kenshoo Ltd. ("<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Kenshoo</span>", "<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">we</span>", "<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">our</span>", "<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">us</span>") has established this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate its privacy protection standards. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected or used by us in connection with this website at [<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">www.kenshoo.com and all pages stemming from this domain</span>] ("<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Site</span>"), and in connection with our services available on this Site. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to enable you to understand how we collect and use information relating to you. </p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Kenshoo does not own or control or to people it does not employ or manage.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Information We Collect </span></p>
<p>Kenshoo collects information from our users at several different points on our Site.

<p>In general, when you visit our Site you remain anonymous. Some areas of our Site may require registration. Personal information, such as a user's name, address, job title, contact information and range of paid search spend may be collected from you and stored in our databases, typically when you register into our services, enter into a sales promotion or otherwise interact with us. It should be made clear that you have no legal obligation to provide us with any personal information and the submission of such information is entirely subject to your sole discretion and consent. However, if you will not provide us with the required information we would not be able to provide you with the information/services requested by you. Registered clients may have a user name and password to access their company information.</p>
<p>We may also collect statistical and other data related to your use of the Site or services thereon, usage patterns or other behavioral information. This information is collected and used as non-individually identifiable information.</p>
<p>Any personal information voluntarily disclosed by you on our Site through e-mail, in public-view personal profiles, public-view uploaded materials, chat rooms, message boards, or intra-site message systems, is viewed and possibly used by other users, and such disclosure may have unintended privacy implications for you.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">How we Use Information </span></p>
<p>We use information which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site and improve our services, to track usersâ€™ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may use the information collected to market directly to that person subject to requirements of applicable law. This non personal information may be shared with third parties.</p>
<p>We compile and store data and information and generate reports related to client's access to and use of our services.</p>
<p>We also use your user information for providing a better experience on the Site and to improve our client services and for providing communications related to our Site, software and services, including for the following: (i) process and reply of your requests, (ii) obtain consents to provide and provide marketing materials, promotions and/or offerings (iii) support related issues, notices about updates, new features, or other information of interest to our users regarding the above. You may opt-out of receiving our marketing information by email only via privacy[at]Kenshoo.com</p>
<p><br>By using our services you agree and allow us to use the information you provide us with for sending you marketing materials regarding our services and/or products, promotions and/or offerings including by email or other reasonable communication method.</p>
<p>To the extent required under applicable data processing laws and regulations, any personal information that we collect will be stored in our data base and will be used in accordance with such applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p><br>We do not share, distribute, sell or rent any of your personal information with/to third parties, except in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>â€¢ If the information is required by law in order to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal activities, situations involving potential threats to physical safety, rights, property or of any person, suspected fraud and violations of our Customer's Terms of Use.

<p>â€¢ If we have your permission to do so.</p>
<p>Any data processing performed by these third parties will, if and when required by law, be governed by data processing agreement in the form required by law, preserving your statutory data protection rights.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Cookies</span></p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Kenshoo uses cookies to enhance the user experience of our web site by means such as storing password or user preference information. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site with the only drawback being the disablement of some of the usability features of our site. Some of our business partners may use cookies on their site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. Kenshoo also uses cookies to track and monitor usage of the website by users for the purposes of marketing and website improvement. The data collected from these cookies will never be shared with an external source and will be used for internal purposes only.<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Tracking Pixels</span></p>
<p>We employ a software technology called tracking pixels that help us better manage content on client web sites. Tracking pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Client's Site</span></p>
<p>Kenshoo serves as an agent for each of its clients, in that we provide our services for the benefit of the client. Each of our clients uses our services to maximize their advertising campaigns. Each client instructs us as to what types of data it would like us to collect on its behalf. This data may include search engine referral and purchase behavior and information.</p>
<p>Kenshoo may track certain actions on clients' websites, including web surfers visiting certain pages on the client's sites or taking specific actions. We use persistent cookies and tracking pixels to determine activity at the client's site. With respect to individuals who visit those sites as a result of clicking on a customer ad on search engines, our ad server will place or read a unique tracking cookie on the computer and will use non-personal information about the browser and activity at this site (such as a web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web surfer, date and time) to track whether the referral results in a transaction, as defined by the customer. </p>
<p>We may further collect technical information about your website(s) for technical reasons and in order to improve our services. </p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Security</span><br><br></p>
<p>We have implemented suitable security policies, rules and technical measures in order to protect and safeguard the personal information we collect online. We limit access to your personal information only to employees who need to have access to such information in order to provide you all the activities related to the Site and services. However, you should be aware that there is no data that is transmitted over the Internet that can be guaranteed 100% secure in transmission or safe from theft or illegal capture. </p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Changes and Consent to Privacy Policy </span></p>
<p><br>By registering with Kenshoo or by using the Site without prior registration, you agree to the terms of this PRIVACY POLICY. We reserve the right to change the provisions of the Privacy Policy from time to time and you are therefore advised to check it regularly. If we make any significant changes in the way we treat personal information, we will notify through your email address or by placing a prominent notice on our site. Your continued use of the Site, software and/or services after any change to the policy constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Links</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span></p>
<p>Our Site may have links to the sites of other companies. Kenshoo is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Update/Delete User Information</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Governing Law</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span></p>
