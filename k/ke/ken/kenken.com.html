        <p>KenKen Puzzle, LLC and its affiliated companies respect the privacy rights of consumers and recognize the importance of protecting the information collected from or about you.  We have adopted this Privacy Policy to explain how we store and use personal and non-personal information we collect through our websites and during your use of our products and services. By registering for a KenKen account, or by using any of our web sites or any of our products or services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY KENKEN SITE OR ANY KENKEN PRODUCT OR SERVICE.  We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this website, our home page, or other places so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Your continued use of our websites, products or services will signify your acceptance of any changes to our Privacy Policy</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:customercare@kenken.com?subject=Customer Care Email">customercare@kenken.com</a>.  </p>
        
        <h3>Types of Information Collected by KenKen</h3>
        <p>KenKen collects both personal and non-personal consumer information.</p>
        
        <p>1.  Personal Information.  Personal information is information that identifies you and that may be used to contact you on-line or off-line. KenKen may collect personal information in varying circumstances, including in connection with your registration for KenKen services accounts; the creation of personal profiles; product, service and subscription orders; customer support and technical service requests; player match up and other head-to-head online competitions; registration for games and special game-specific events; newsletter subscriptions, referral services, and other marketing surveys and email campaigns.
        The specific personal information collected will vary depending upon the activity and may include, among other information, your name, gender, age, birthday, occupation, educational level, email address, phone number, home address, birth date, mobile phone number and carrier details, and credit card information. If we conduct contests or award prizes, you may also be required to provide your Social Security or other identification number for tax purposes. 
        We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with products or services.  If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information contact us at <a href="mailto:customercare@kenken.com?subject=Customer Care Email">customercare@kenken.com</a>.  There may be instances where we are legally required to retain your information.
        </p>
        
        <p>KenKen does not knowingly collect or store any personal information, even in aggregate, about children under the age of 13.</p>
        
        <p>2.  Non-Personal Information.  Non-personal information, alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you.  KenKen may collect non-personal information about your use of our products and services both on our websites and in the course of game play and software usage.  For example, when you use KenKen products or services, we may collect certain non-personal demographic information including gender, zip code, information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, media, mobile device, including device IDs, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media Access Control (MAC) address and connection. We may also collect other non-personal information such as username, feature usage, game play statistics, scores and achievements, user rankings and click paths as well as other data that you may provide. </p>
        
        <h3>How KenKen Collects Information</h3>
        <p>KenKen collects non-personal information along with personal information when you actively provide it in the context of various activities including online purchases, registration and marketing surveys.  In addition, we and other third parties use cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor advertisements and other activities.  We may also derive from the information collected other facts, such as determining the applicable tax rate based on your IP address.  To collect this information, KenKen may use various industry-standard information gathering techniques and technologies such as browser cookies (including flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects”), clear GIFs, tracking pixels, and internet log files.  We may also use analytics technologies to collect non-personal information when you use our products and services to collect and analyze information relating to your use of our products and services and to better personalize your user experience.</p>
        
        <p>KenKen’s websites, products and services may employ third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help track.  We or third parties operating the advertisement serving technology may use demographic information such as age and gender as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the site, product or service and to calculate or control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, or deliver ads that relate to your interests and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.   We or third parties may log various data for this purpose and the data may be used and disclosed per this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology and to other third parties in a form that does not personally identify you.</p>
        
        <h3>Information Provided To KenKen by Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We may also receive information from third parties, including in connection with the operation and distribution of our products and services as well as market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal and anonymous information provided directly by you. Some third party services such as Twitter and Facebook may also provide us with information from your accounts there with your permission.  By playing a KenKen game through a social network or other third party platform or service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or service via one of our products or services, you are authorizing KenKen to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the social network or other third party platform could provide to KenKen through the social network/third party platform Application Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the third party social network or platform. Your agreement takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform or service via our products or services, or when you connect with, “accept” or “allow” (or similar terms) one of our applications through a social network, or other third party platform or service.</p>
        
        <h3>How KenKen Uses Collected Information</h3>
        <p>KenKen uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You may also later opt out of certain of these communications. Otherwise, KenKen uses personal and non-personal information, both individually and combined together, to better understand the behavior and preferences of our customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve static and dynamic advertising, to enforce our Terms of Service, to ensure proper functioning of our products and services and to help improve them. Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is also conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and achievements) generated through your participation.</p>
        
        <h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
        <p>KenKen will never share your personal information with third parties without your consent.  We may, however, share anonymous, non-personal, aggregated or public information with third parties.  There may be circumstances where you share information on your own or opt in to allow KenKen to share your personal information with companies and organizations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. To opt out of further communications from a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your information has been shared, please contact that partner or sponsor directly.</p>
        
        <p>KenKen does not disclose any personal information about individuals under 18 years of age who have registered on any of our websites to third parties, or share or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy, provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of KenKen customer information may be transferred to its successor or assign regardless of age.  </p>
        
        <p>We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on KenKen. </p>
        
        <h3>Protection of Information</h3>
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  We use generally accepted methods to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        
        <h3>Review and Correction of Information and Deactivating Your Account</h3>
        <p>You may correct or update your account information at any time by logging on our site and navigating to your account settings.  Should you be unable to log in or wish to have your account deactivated, contact us at <a href="mailto:customercare@kenken.com?subject=Customer Care Email">customercare@kenken.com</a> and we will review, update or remove information as appropriate.  We may still retain your information in our files however, to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreement, and due to technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our websites.</p>
        
        <h3>Public Information Including User Generated Content</h3>
        <p>You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to KenKen sites or products or services, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in similar forums on our sites or on third party sites.  Information that you disclose in any of these forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality.  You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to make public in any of these forums.  Note also that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies.  KenKen has no control over the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share.</p>
        
        <h3>Third Party Sites</h3>
        <p>Our website may contain advertising or services which link to other websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party.  If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the KenKen site you are visiting and go to the site you selected.  Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as KenKen.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.  If you visit a third party website that is linked to a KenKen site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>
        
        <h3>Products Offered In Partnership With Third Parties</h3>
        <p>Users may register for other services from our sites. Certain products or services available on our sites are provided to you in partnership with third parties and may require you to disclose personally identifiable information in order to register for and access such products or services. Such products and services shall identify the third party partners at the point of registration. If you elect to register for such products or services your personally identifiable information will be transferred to such third parties and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third parties.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices and policies of such third parties and, therefore, you should review the privacy practices and policies of such third parties prior to providing your personally identifiable information in connection with such products or services. </p>
