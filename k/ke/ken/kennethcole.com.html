<p class="header">Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. Privacy Policy</p>

<p>Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. (together with its wholly owned affiliates and subsidiaries "<b>KCP</b>" "<b>we</b>," "<b>us</b>") is concerned about online privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy (the "<b>Policy</b>") describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through our website located at <a href="www.kennethcole.com">www.kennethcole.com</a> and through our company-owned stores (collectively, the "<b>Site</b>"). </p>

<p>By using the Site, you agree to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Policy without prior notice. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the <i>"Last Updated"</i> legend at the top of this page. Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect. </p>

<ol class="arabic">

	<li><b>What Types of Information Does KCP Collect From Me? </b><br>
		KCP collects two basic types of information through the Site: "<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>" ("<b>PII</b>") and "<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>" ("<b>Non-PII</b>"). Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. <br><br>
		<ol class="loweralpha">
			<li><b>Personally Identifiable Information.</b> You do not have to provide PII to browse most areas of the Site. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to sign up for a newsletter, make a purchase, or to request certain information from KCP), we may require that you furnish PII. We collect PII from you through the Site, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other payment account number, only when you voluntarily provide it to us. <br><br></li>
			<li><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</b> When you visit and interact with the Site, KCP and third parties with whom KCP has contracted to provide services to it may collect Non-PII such as a catalog of the Site pages you visit. Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from five different sources: server log files, environmental variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.<br><br>
				<ol class="lowerroman">
					<li><b>Server Log Files.</b> Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. <br><br></li>
					<li><b>Environmental Variables.</b> We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site. <br><br></li>
					<li><b>Cookies.</b> We and our service providers may use "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most websites, and can facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a particular website; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular website, to your computer. <br><br></li>
					<li><b>Pixel Tags.</b> We and our service providers may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "<b>Pixel Tags</b>") in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the visitors' hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, to serve ads, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened. <br><br></li>
					<li><b>Information That You Voluntarily Provide.</b> KCP also collects Non-PII (<i>e.g.,</i> your geographic location, vote in a Cole Poll, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. When such information is not combined with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it does not personally identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy. Please note that if we combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII as long as it is so combined. <br><br></li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>How Does KCP Use Information Collected From Me?</b><br><br>
		<ol class="loweralpha">
			<li><b>Personally Identifiable Information.</b> We may use PII you provide in the following ways:<br><br>
				<ol class="lowerroman">
					<li><b>Fulfillment of Requests.</b> KCP may use PII you provide for the purposes detailed in this policy including to send you newsletters, fulfill your purchase or respond to an investor's information request. <br><br></li>
					<li><b>Administrative Communications.</b> From time to time we may use PII to send to you important information regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications. <br><br></li>
					<li><b>Other Communications.</b> From time to time, we may use PII to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. If you would prefer that we do not send such marketing messages to you, please see the <i>"Opt-Out"</i> section below ("KCP Opt-Out"). <br><br></li>
					<li><b>Purchases.</b> When you make a purchase through the Site, we may collect your credit card number or other payment account number, billing address and other information related to such purchase (collectively, "<b>Payment Information</b>") from you, and may use such Payment Information in order to fulfill your purchase. <br><br></li>
					<li><b>E-mails to Friends.</b> We may provide the functionality to permit you to send messages regarding Site-related content to a friend through the Site. If you wish to use this feature, you may provide us with your friend's e-mail address so that we can facilitate your sending a message to your friend. KCP may retain your friend's email address and will use your friends address only as described in this Privacy Policy. <br><br></li>
					<li><b>Promotions.</b> We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, "<b>Promotions</b>") through the Site. We typically ask you for certain PII when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about KCP's use of PII. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of PII conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules will control. <br><br></li>
					<li><b>Internal Business Purposes.</b> We may also use PII for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis and audits. In addition, we may also use PII to enhance our information and to aid us in providing our customers with targeted promotions. <br><br></li>
					<li><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</b> Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non-PII with other third parties, for any purpose. <br><br></li>
				</ol>
			In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII. If we combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII as long as it is so combined (see Section 2.a above). <br><br></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>How Is Personally Identifiable Information Collected on the Site Shared? </b><br><br>
		<ol class="loweralpha">
			<li><b>Service Providers.</b> We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to website operation, payment processing and authorization, data analysis, order fulfillment, customer support, list enhancement and other administrative services. We may share PII with such third parties for the purpose of enabling these third parties to provide services to us. Such service providers may include customer support specialists, webhosting companies, customer data management and enhancement companies, payment processors, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fill product orders or coordinate mailings), data analysis firms and email service providers. Such third parties may be provided with access to PII needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose. <br><br></li>
			<li><b>Third Party Communications.</b> From time to time, we may share PII with third parties to allow them to contact you regarding products, programs, services and promotions that they believe may be of interest to you. If you would prefer that we do not share PII about you with such third parties for their marketing purposes, please see the <i>"Opt-Out"</i> section below "Third Party Opt-Out"). <br><br></li>
			<li><b>E-mails to Friends.</b> Please note that any PII you provide in connection with sending messages regarding Site-related content to a friend through the Site, such as your name and your e-mail address, will be disclosed to your friend. <br><br></li>
			<li><b>Promotions.</b> We may share the PII you provide in connection with Promotions with third-party sponsors of such Promotions (irrespective of whether such Promotions are hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to the particular Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about a sponsor's or other third parties' use of PII about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of PII conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules will control. <br><br></li>
			<li><b>Information Posted by Visitors.</b> KCP may make available through the Site services (for example, message boards, chat functionality and blogs, among other services) to which you are able to post information and materials. Please note that any information you disclose through such services or otherwise on the Site becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Site and to the general public. In addition, when you choose to make a posting on such services, certain PII will be available for other users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose PII, or any other information, on the Site. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PII YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE SITE. <br><br></li>
			<li><b>Assignment.</b> We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from Site users to an affiliate or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of KCP's business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). <br><br></li>
			<li><b>Law enforcement; emergencies; compliance.</b> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose PII to others as we believe appropriate (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to respond to governmental requests; (c) to enforce our Terms of Use; (e) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of KCP, you or others; and (f) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. <br><br></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Other Important Notices Regarding Our Privacy Practices.</b><br><br>
		<ol class="loweralpha">
			<li><b>Third-Party Sites.</b> The Site may contain links to third-party websites. These linked sites are not under KCP's control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by KCP. If you provide any PII through any such third-party website, your transaction will occur on the third party's website (not the Site) and the PII you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any third parties. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES. <br><br></li>
			<li><b>Security.</b> We have security measures and tools, such as firewalls, in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please notify us of the problem as soon as possible by contacting us in accordance with Section 6 (<i>"Contacting Us,"</i>) below (note that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem). <br><br></li>
			<li><b>Other Information.</b> The Site is controlled and operated by KCP from the United States, and is not intended to subject KCP to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. KCP does not represent or warrant that the Site, or any part thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. We may limit the Site's availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion. <br><br></li>
			<li><b>Note Regarding the Use of the Site by Children:</b> The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we request that such individuals not provide Personally Identifiable Information through the Site. If you are under 18 years of age, you may browse our Site; however, you may not provide PII to us such as registering or making a purchase. <br><br></li>

	</li>
	<li><b>Choices</b><br><br>
		<ol class="loweralpha">
			<li><b>KCP Opt-Out.</b> You have the right to control your information at KCP. <br><br>
				<ol class="lowerroman">
