		<span class="headline6">Registration: </span>When you sign up to use one of our services, request a price
		quote or enter a contest, we may ask for information about you, including
		your name,  age, address, and phone number, as well as demographic
		information. To sign up to use one of our services, request a price or enter

		<br><br>
		<span class="headline6">Cookies:</span> Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's
		hard drive by our computers (or servers) to identify your computer. Cookies
		are only  read by the server that placed them there and are unable to
		execute any code or virus. We use cookies to recognize you when you visit
		our site, to personalize  your experience and generally to serve you better.
		For example, if you enter your name, address, telephone number, email
		address, ZIP code or other  personally identifiable information on one of
		our forms, such information will be stored in a cookie so you do not have to
		enter this information again. Cookies  can also tell us which advertising
		you have seen on our site, allowing us to offer you a more diverse selection
		of advertising information. Cookies may also  compile data about our
		visitors.
		<br><br>

		of your computer on the Internet - for administrative purposes only.
		kenoshacounty.com does not collect any personally identifiable information
		through its compilation of your IP addresses or the location of your
		computer on the  Internet.

		kenoshacounty.com may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order
		to measure interest in the various areas of our site, for development
		purposes,  and to inform advertisers and partners about consumers clicking
		on their advertising or other messages. In these analyses, we will disclose
		information to third  parties only in aggregate form.

		<span class="headline6">E-mail:</span> Using the e-mail addresses provided by registrants 18 years of age
		and older, kenoshacounty.com, its advertisers, affiliates, partners, or
		third parties  may periodically send promotional e-mail. In any case where
		we might use an email address for this purpose, you will be able to indicate
		at registration that you  do not wish to receive such promotional e-mails
		from kenoshacounty.com, its advertisers, affiliates, partners or third
		parties. However, by registering, you agree  that kenoshacounty.com may
		contact you by e-mail regarding account status, changes to the registrant
		agreement, and to confirm registration. In addition, if  you provide your
		email address or other contact data in connection with a request for product
		information, kenoshacounty.com, an advertiser, affiliate, partner or  third
		parties, as applicable, will use that information to contact you.
		<br>

		ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate
		procedures to protect the information we collect online, including
		reasonable and appropriate security for credit card submissions.
		<br><br>
		<span class="headline3">What is kenoshacounty.com's relationship with affiliates and business partners?</span><br>
		We have close relationships with affiliated newspapers and other business
		partners. Certain of those affiliates and partners have web pages that are
		branded  both with our trademarks and the trademarks of our business
		partners. You may visit us through a co-branded page that is, for example,
		an  kenoshacounty.com page that is co-branded with XYZ Newspaper's web site.
		<br><br>
		<span class="headline3">With whom do we share the information we collect?</span><br>
		In the future, kenoshacounty.com may share your personally identifiable
		information with third parties for direct marketing purposes, but only if
		you have  authorized kenoshacounty.com to do so and only if you are over the
		age of 18. At the present time, kenoshacounty.com will only share personally
		identifiable  information with third parties as is necessary for those third
		parties to provide information or perform services specifically requested by
		you. Additionally, if you  entered the kenoshacounty.com web site through a
		site maintained by one of our affiliates or business partners, then your
		personally identifiable information  may be shared with that affiliate or
