		<p>Welcome to <a href="http://www.keyingredient.com" title="Key Ingredient">KeyIngredient.com</a> and <a href="http://www.scanmyrecipes.com" title="Scan My Recipes">ScanMyRecipes.com</a>.  <a href="http://www.keyingredient.com" title="Key Ingredient">KeyIngredient.com</a> is a social networking service that allows cooks to preserve and share the recipes they love.  <a href="http://www.scanmyrecipes.com" title="Scan My Recipes">ScanMyRecipes.com</a> provides a quick and easy way to have recipes scanned, converted to electronic format, and added to your collection on <a href="http://www.keyingredient.com" title="Key Ingredient">KeyIngredient.com</a>.  Both of these Web sites (the "Site(s)") are owned and operated by Key Ingredient Corporation ("Key Ingredient," "we," "us," and "our").  Key Ingredient provides the Sites and the content and services available through the Sites (collectively, the "Services") subject to our Terms of Service, which include this Online Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy explains how we protect your privacy when you use our Sites.  </p>
		<p><strong>Scope of This Privacy Policy</strong></p>

		<p><strong>This Privacy Policy May Change</strong></p>
		<p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version on the Sites.  These changes will be effective as of the date we post the revised version on the Sites, but will only apply to the personal information we collect after we have posted the revised Policy on the Sites.  By accessing or using one of our Sites following any such change, you are agreeing that all personal information collected from or about you through our Sites after the revised Privacy Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.  </p>
		<p>We will alert you to changes in these Terms of Service by providing a notice at the top of this page for at least 30 days after the new effective date.  It is, therefore, important for you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis.  </p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of February 19, 2008.</p>
		<p>You may access the current version of this Privacy Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked "Privacy Policy" at the bottom of each page of this Site.  </p>
		<p><strong>Privacy Notices</strong></p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by "Privacy Notices" posted on the Web pages on which we collect your personal information.  Generally, Privacy Notices provide details about the personal information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.</p>
		<p><strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect Through Our Sites?</strong></p>
		<p>There are several ways we collect personal information through our Sites:</p>
		<p><em>Information You Provide.</em>  We collect the personal information you knowingly and voluntarily provide (about yourself and others) when you use our Sites, for example, the information you provide when you sign up to become a Member of <a href="http://www.keyingredient.com" title="Key Ingredient">KeyIngredient.com</a>, when you create or update your Member profile on <a href="http://www.keyingredient.com" title="Key Ingredient">KeyIngredient.com</a>, and when you make a purchase on one of the Sites.  </p>
		<p><em>Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser.</em>  We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser.  This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser. the date and time of your visit, the address of the Web page you were visiting when you accessed our Site, and the pages you visit.  Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.  </p>
		<p>The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally.  However, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network.  If we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs – which contain visitors' IP addresses – with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.  In addition, if you have created a "user identity" during one of your visits, we may link the information provided by your browser to information in our database that identifies you personally.</p>
		<p><em>Information Collected Using "Cookies" and Other Web Technologies.</em>  We use "cookies," and similar technologies to collect information and manage and support our Services. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server.  Cookies cannot be used to install computer programs or deliver viruses to your computer. We may use two types of cookies -- "session cookies" and "persistent cookies."</p>
		<p>A "session cookie" assigns a randomly-generated, unique identification number to your computer when you access one of our Sites. A session cookie expires after you close your browser. Generally, we use session cookies to collect information about the ways visitors use our Sites – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. This information is known as "click-stream information." Session cookies may also be used to facilitate your interactions with our Sites.</p>
		<p>We may also use "persistent cookies." These cookies do not expire when you close your browser, but stay on your computer until they expire or you delete them. Each time you visit one of our Sites, our Web server will recognize you by "searching" the information contained in these cookies.  By assigning your computer a persistent, unique identifier, we are able to create a database of your previous choices and preferences. This permits us to offer you a personalized experience when you use our Sites. Assigning your computer a persistent, unique identifier also helps us keep a more accurate account of how many people visit our Sites, how often they return, how their use of our Sites may vary over time, and the effectiveness of our promotional efforts.</p>
		<p>Neither session cookies nor persistent cookies identify you personally. If, however, you have created a user identity on one of your visits to our Sites, we may link the information collected by our cookies to information that identifies you personally.</p>
		<p>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Site. Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit our Sites, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of our Sites.</p>
		<p>In addition to cookies, we may also use "web beacons" and other web technologies to manage our Sites and email. A web beacon is a small bit of computer code. Web beacons may be used to count how many people visit a web page or tell us whether an email has been opened. We may link the information we collect using web beacons and other web technologies to information that identifies you personally.</p>

This means, for example, that one of Your Recipes (including the information and links you post on the "description," "recipe," and "about" tabs) may appear on another Web site surrounded by advertisements, together with a link to <a href="http://www.keyingredient.com" title="Key Ingredient">KeyIngredient.com</a>, or as part of an advertisement in a magazine.  Further, you agree that by posting Your Content on or through our Services, you are granting Key Ingredient the right, with no obligation, to use your name, photograph, and geographical location (e.g. city and state) in connection with Your Recipes when Your Recipes appear or are broadcast on <a href="http://www.keyingredient.com" title="Key Ingredient">KeyIngredient.com</a>, on other Web sites or in other media as described above.  If you do not want Your Recipes to be made available to the general public in any of these ways, you may "opt-out" by selecting the appropriate recipe privacy setting on your profile page on <a href="http://www.keyingredient.com" title="Key Ingredient">KeyIngredient.com</a>.  If you do not want us to make your name or geographical location available to the general public in any of these ways, you may "opt-out" by selecting the appropriate privacy settings on your profile page on <a href="http://www.keyingredient.com" title="Key Ingredient">KeyIngredient.com</a>.  If you do not want your photograph to be made available to the general public in any of these ways, DO NOT UPLOAD A PHOTOGRAPH to your profile page on <a href="http://www.keyingredient.com" title="Key Ingredient">KeyIngredient.com</a>.
