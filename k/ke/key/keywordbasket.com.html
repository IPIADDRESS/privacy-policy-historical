													<strong>Information 
													Collected by our ISP</strong><br>
													<br>
													The hosting provider for 
													this Internet site (as with 
													any Internet site) has the 
													ability to record various 
													information, including 
													domain name, pages accessed, 
													date and time of access, web 
													browser type and computer 
													operating system, and 
													referring information, and 
													to disclose this 
													information. This is most 
													commonly done by providing 
													access to raw server logs. 
													For more information you 
													should perform an Internet 
													search on 'server logs' or 
													'raw server logs.' We may 
													have access to our raw 
													server logs and access 
													reports prepared by our 
													hosting provider.<br>
													<br>
													<strong>Financial 
													Information for Billing 
													Purposes</strong><br>
													<br>
													We sell products and 
													services. When sales are 
													made financial information 
													must be disclosed. This 
													information can include any 
													number of facts you are 
													asked to provide, but most 
													commonly includes your name, 
													financial / credit card 
													information, billing 
													address, and email address. 
													Generally, this purchase 
													information will be provided 
													by you to a third party 
													payment processor and we do 
													not receive your financial / 
													credit card information.<br>
													In the event we do receive 
													financial / credit card 
													information, we will not 
													disclose it to anyone unless 
													disclosure is required by 
													law or a court order, or 
													unless disclosure is 
													required to address an issue 
													implicated by the financial 
													transaction. If you claim 
													that your financial 
													information was used to make 
													a purchase you did not 
													authorize, details about the 
													financial transaction may be 
													disclosed to law enforcement 
													and anyone else we deem 
													necessary to address the 
													matter.</p>
													<p class="maintext Stil1 Stil2" align="left">
													<strong>Use of eMail 
													Addresses and other Contact 
													Information</strong><br>
													<br>
													An important part of our

													expressly consent to 
													receiving communications 
													from us via email, fax, 
													telephone, mail, or any

													<b>How does the Site keep

													security numbers, is 
													protected by encryption 
													protocols, in place to 
													protect information sent 
													over the Internet. While we 
													take commercially reasonable

													from the Site's database by 
													contacting 
													info@keywordbasket.com. 
													However, because of backups

													may be impossible to delete 
													a Visitor's entry without 
													retaining some residual 
													information. An individual 
													who requests to have 
													Personally Identifiable 
													Information deactivated will 
													have this information 
													functionally deleted, and we 
													will not sell, transfer, or

													<br>
													<b>What happens if the 
													Privacy Policy Changes?</b><br>
													<br>
													We will let our Visitors and 
													Authorized Customers know 
													about changes to our privacy 
													policy by posting such

													However, if we are changing 
													our privacy policy in a 
													manner that might cause 
													disclosure of Personally

													that a Visitor or Authorized 
													Customer has previously
