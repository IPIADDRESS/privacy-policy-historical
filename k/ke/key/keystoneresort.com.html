<b>Vail Resorts Management Company Internet Privacy Policy</b>
<div align="right">UPDATED 09/05/2000</div>
<br>
The Vail Corporation and its subsidiary companies ("VRMC") are committed to 
protecting the personal privacy of visitors and guests using its Internet sites.
<br><br>
VRMC’s privacy policy aims to accomplish three basic goals: 
<ul>
<li>VRMC will not release personally identifiable information without consent.</li>
<li>VRMC will allow the user to control certain aspects of the information 
voluntarily submitted.</li>
<li>VRMC encourages its site users to communicate privacy concerns and VRMC will 
respond to such concerns.</li>
</ul>
<b>Coverage</b> 
<br><br>
This privacy policy applies to VRMC owned and operated sites. 
<br><br>
<b>Definitions of Types of Information</b> 
<br><br>
Personally identifiable information is information or other data that may 
specifically identify an individual user.  In order for you to access certain 
services and to purchase services that we offer via the Sites, we require you 
to provide us with such Personal Information.  Personal Information may include: 
(i) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing and e-mail addresses); (ii) 
Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number); and (iii) 
Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age and income).  If you communicate 
with us by e-mail or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries, 
any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal 
Information.
<br><br>
Traffic Data shall not be considered personally identifiable information or 
Personal Information. Traffic Data is information on a user’s patterns of access 
and usage of the sites.  We automatically track and collect the following 
information when you visit our Site, including your: (i) IP address; (ii) 
domain server; (iii) type of computer; and (iv) type of web browser.  Traffic 
Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is 
helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Site.  
We also use "cookies" to as a method to gain dependable and consistant Traffic 
Data.   "Cookies" are anonymous and do not personally identify you.
<br><br>
<b>Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information </b>
<br><br>
Registration
<br><br>
A user may access and utilize the vast majority of VRMC site functionality 
without transmitting any Personal Information.  In order to access certain 
other functionality, VRMC may request the user provide personally identifiable 
information.  At no time is the user under any obligation to provide Personal 
Information.  If the user does not wish to access such functionality, the user 
should not transmit the personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
During the registration process VRMC shall require the user to complete certain data fields.  Some fields may be optional.  VRMC shall request contact information and shall utilize such information in the following manner: 
<ul>
<li>to send communications regarding the Vail Resorts.</li>
<li>to share user information with specific strategic partners, if and only if 
authorized to do so by the user.</li>
<li>to allow specific strategic partners to communicate with the user, if and 
only if authorized to do so by the user.</li>
</ul>
If you indicate to us that you do not want to receive certain types of 
communications at the time of registration, we will respect your wishes, and 
comply with your preferences. If you already are a registered user and would 
like to review or change the choices you have made, you may 
<a href="mailto:privacy-support@vailresorts.com">click here</a> to 
email us at privacy-support@vailresorts.com for assistance.
<br><br>
Contests, Etc.
<br><br>
From time to time, we may run contests on our site in which we ask participants 
for contact information, such as their e-mail address(es). If you participate in 
contests, your contact information will be used primarily to reach you in 
connection with the contests. We may also use the collected contact information 
to send you information about Vail Resorts, our services, as well as offers 
tailored to your interests by our corporate partners, if you have opted to 
receive these communications. You may choose to opt-out of receiving such 
mailings at the time of registration for the contest, or afterwards, by 
<a href="mailto:privacy-support@vailresorts.com">click here</a> to 
email us at privacy-support@vailresorts.com.
<br><br>
<b>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties</b> 
<br><br>
In order to optimize and improve the online experience for our guests, we may share 
your Personal Information with carefully selected companies with whom we have 
relationships.  However, we will not share your personally identifiable information 
unless you have given us your consent to do so, as in our registration forms. If 
you have previously opted-in, but now wish to remove yourself from these mailing 
lists, you may send email directly to 
<a href="mailto:privacy-support@vailresorts.com">privacy-support@vailresorts.com</a>, 
and we will modify your preference accordingly. Our partners who receive information 
from us have the right to use the data we provide them (sometimes, in connection 
with other information they may have gathered about you). 
<br><br>
<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b>  In certain special cases, we may disclose your 
personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that 
disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal 
action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring 
or interfering with VRMC's rights, property or operations, other VRMC site users, 
or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose your 
personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it, or in 
response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a 
criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection 
with a pending civil case, administrative investigation or investigation 
conducted by VRMC.  We shall have no obligation to inform you of our compliance 
with the law, including without limitation a response to a law enforcement 
request or a valid subpoena.
<br><br>
<b>Traffic Data</b>
<br><br>
When you use our site, we collect Traffic Data, even if you have not registered 
with VRMC. We use this information to personalize your experience at all the 
sites that VRMC operates and generally to improve our services. We share this 
Traffic Data with selected corporate partners. 
<br><br>
<b>Cookies: How They Are Used</b>
<br><br>
How They Are Used
<br><br>
A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server 
and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your system or 
impair its functioning in any way. We use cookies to help us provide customizable 
services and to allow you to sign-in to our site. Cookies may also be used by 
VRMC corporate partners on co-branded Web pages, as explained below in "third 
party relationships," so please be aware of this as you visit these Web pages.
<br><br>
You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. 
You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show 
you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your 
experience at our site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features 
will not work as intended.
<br><br>
<b>Children/Family Filter</b> 
<br><br>
VRMC is concerned about protecting the safety of the children who use our site. The VRMC sites – sites directed to a broad, general audience – comply with the terms of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. As such, we will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information on users under the age of 13,without the consent of a parent to do so.  Parents have the ability to control what, if any, Personal Information about their child may be disclosed to third parties, by regulating the actions and behavior of their children using the internet. 
<br><br>
<b>Use of IP Addresses</b>
<br><br>
An Internet protocol (IP) address is a set of numbers that is automatically 
assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider 
or through your company’s local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). 
Web servers - the powerful computers that provide web pages for viewing - 
automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during 
your session online.
<br><br>
VRMC may collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report 
user Traffic Data to our corporate partners (as explained above), and to audit 
the use of our site. We do not ordinarily link a user’s IP address to the Personal 
Information of that user, which means each user’s session will be logged, but the 
user remains anonymous to us. However, we can and will use IP addresses to 
identify users of our site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance 
with our site’s <a href="legal.asp">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> 
or terms of service, or to protect our service, site, or other users. 
<br><br>
<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> Under certain circumstances, IP addresses and/or 
domain names may be linked to personally identifiable information, when said 
information is stored in databases managed by Internet registrars or registries 
such as <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/" target="_blank">Network Solutions</a>. 
<br><br>
<b>Third-Party Relationships</b> 
<br><br>
In order to optimize your experience on our sites, VRMC maintains relationships 
with many corporate partners and service providers throughout the world.  If you 
have any questions about whether certain information, content or services pertain 
to us, or are provided by one of our partners, please contact us at 
<a href="mailto:privacy-support@vailresorts.com">privacy-support@vailresorts.com</a>.
<br><br>
Whenever you provide registration information on certain Web pages or for certain 
services provided in conjunction with third party partners, we want to be clear 
that some data you provide is shared with partners. For instance, certain information 
is shared with WorldRes.com, our provider of online reservation service. You should 
make every effort to read the privacy policies provided by or in association with 
such third parties, and make an informed decision on your own whether or not to 
continue utilizing the services based upon the privacy policies posted on these 
Web pages, at your own discretion. However, we will make every effort to ensure 
that you have the ability to opt-out of the sharing of such data with partners. 
You may email us directly at 
<a href="mailto:privacy-support@vailresorts.com">privacy-support@vailresorts.com</a> 
and we will forward 
your request to the appropriate company, and help you follow up to ensure that 
your concerns are adequately handled.
<br><br>
In addition to finding these Web pages, you will find direct links on VRMC to the 
sites offered by third parties. Some of these sites are authorized to use the Vail 
Resorts brands and/or logos.  VRMC carefully evaluates all parties that are 
authorized to use its brands and/or logos, and believes that all such sites have 
adopted acceptable privacy policies. Again, you should read these third party 
privacy policies, and make an informed decision on your own as to whether or not 
to continue based upon these sites' privacy practices, at your own discretion. 
No third-party sites are covered by this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
<b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b> If you feel that a site using the VRMC brands 
and/or logos has not posted an acceptable privacy policy, or is not following 
the privacy policy it has posted, please send us an email at 
<a href="mailto:privacy-support@vailresorts.com">privacy-support@vailresorts.com</a>.  
If appropriate, we may forward complaints to the appropriate third parties and help 
you follow up to ensure that your concerns are adequately handled. Of course, if 
any of these third party companies does not have a privacy policy that is 
acceptable to you, you should refrain from providing information until your 
concerns have been satisfactorily addressed. 
<br><br>
<b>Security</b>
<br><br>
VRMC operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall
and password protection. VRMC 
has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and 
alteration of your user data under our control.  While we cannot guarantee that 
loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we make every reasonable effort 
to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. 
<br><br>
You must promptly notify us if your credit card, pass product with ResortCharge,

event, we will cancel that credit card number, pass product, user name or password 
and update our records accordingly.
