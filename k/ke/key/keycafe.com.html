    <hr>
    <h2 id="how-we-secure-store-and-retain-your-info">How We Secure, Store, and Retain Your Information</h2>

    <h3>How and Where Your Data is Secured and Stored</h3>
    <p>We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the data we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate. For more information about our security practices, please visit <a href="https://www.keycafe.com/security" class="wrap">https://www.keycafe.com/security</a>. The Service is not without inherent risks as made clear in the Keycafe Terms and Community Guidelines.</p>
    <p>We are headquartered in Vancouver, Canada and do not process your data on premises. We rely upon best in class third-party cloud service providers to process and store your information on our behalf and these providers may process and store your information in the United States, Canada, the European Union and other countries. We have verified these providers have GDPR compliance programs in place and have entered into data processing agreements with our service providers that restrict and regulate their processing of your data on our behalf. By visiting or using our Services, you consent to to the transfer, storage, and processing by us and our processors which may result in your data being processed outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA").</p>

    <h3>Our Basis for Storing and Retaining Data</h3>
    <p>We retain personally identifiable information only for as long as necessary to provide you with the Service, letting you know about our Service's evolving product capabilities and geographic availability, and other legitimate legal or business purposes such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>mandated by law, contract or similar obligations applicable to our business operations</li>
        <li>for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights</li>
        <li>needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Customers who trial the service or subscribe as a property owner, though they may pause usage or unsubscribe, often later resume the Service as a result of seasonal trends, changing personal circumstance, or new key exchange locations or product capabilities we add. Similarly, as we expand we find that guests from around the world may be given an access through Keycafe more than once and link future accesses to their existing account, and - encouragingly to all of us at Keycafe - a high percentage of guests surveyed indicate they would like to use the Service once it is available in their geographic area. Keycafe has the unique challenge of expanding a physical network of kiosks across borders, to cities and countries around the world, and adding new access hardware compatibilities before the Service can be made useful to entire Customer segments and for referrals to finally be realized. Having the ability to make you aware of our evolving product and geographic availabilities is crucial to meeting this business challenge.  For all of these reasons, we generally maintain your information as long as your account is open.</p>

    <h3>Our Retention Policy</h3>
    <p>Keycafe has a number of automated rules to automatically permanently delete internal emails, dialogues, and data files after a certain period of time, helping ensure that unstructured data that may relate to you is continuously removed from our system.  Regarding your personally identifiable data and the databases used to enable your account, our policy is as follows:</p>
    <p><strong>We will continue to store your personally identifiable information: (i) if you are registered user, until one year after you cancel your account, (ii) if you are unregistered guest user, until your communication preferences are set to off and one year has passed since your last access expired, or (iii) until 30 days after a formal request is sent by you to privacy@keycafe.com to remove your information.</strong></p>
    <p>If (i) or (ii) describes your circumstance at the time of the publication of this Privacy Policy, your one year retention period commences May 24, 2018.</p>
    <p>Please note some of the limitations relating to removal of your data: (i) before Keycafe removes your information after the expiry of a retention period above, we may notify you and/or require a confirmation from you. (ii) the removal of your personally identifiable information does not mean that all of your data will be removed (which we may maintain for statistical purposes and system integrity), but only that it can no longer be identified in our database as yours, (iii) your data may continue to appear in the transaction histories of Customers you interacted with as you both "own" that data, (iv) it is possible that Customers you interacted with or third parties you authorized with access to your account may have retrieved and stored data related to you; such activity is irretrievable and beyond our control, and you should contact those parties if you wish for them to no longer store your data, and (v) some of our third-party service providers may have separate legal obligations to retain your data (such as billing providers)</p>

    <h3>Pseudonymization, Support PINs, and Synthetic Data</h3>
    <p>Although not ready at the time of the last update to this Privacy Policy, we have work in progress to re-architect our systems to use a number of advanced privacy techniques.  We are striving to further protect your data through “pseudonymization”, a technique recommended but not required under the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) in Europe.  Everywhere your name, email, mobile or other personally identifiable information would traditionally appear in our or our third parties’ databases we will generally instead store or present to our team a random unique pseudonym you are known by (such as “Sally Incognito”).  Additionally we have underway efforts to let you identify yourself to our support team with a one-time use code displayed in your mobile app, which will allow you to securely identify yourself while maintaining your pseudonymity.  Finally, we are working on plans to have our software engineers utilize synthetic data for their development activities, thus shielding  your data from most or all of our engineering team.  These approaches will reduce exposure of your personally identifiable information among Keycafe’s team and third-party providers, further safeguard your data against possible breach, and facilitate your data removal rights.  Excluded from these efforts will be situations where it is impossible to maintain your pseudonymity, such as with our credit card processing provider which must have your real identifying information, or other cases that would limit our ability to provide the Service or conduct our business effectively.  These initiatives are a work in progress and subject to review and exception in our sole discretion as we learn how to balance them with our business needs, but we are pleased as a still early stage company to take the opportunity to lay a best-in-class foundation for privacy into our systems.</p>

    <h3>Communications Settings</h3>
    <p>We make you aware at the time you register that by providing your information and registering you are agreeing to receive communications that relate to your security and account, product and service updates, and feedback requests, and that you may change your settings after registering your account. We do not opt you into Keycafe communications regarding marketing and offers, but we hope you will opt in and let us be in touch!</p>
    <p>You can opt out of you or your guests from receiving certain communications by going to the communications settings area of our mobile app at <a href="https://www.keycafe.com/mobile#!/notification" class="wrap">https://www.keycafe.com/mobile#!/notification</a></p>
    <p>If we send you an automated communication by email that is non-mandatory, it will contain an unsubscribe link permitting you to "opt out" of receiving future communications. This option will opt you out of that communication type. For example, if you received a location launch email and you unsubscribe, this will change your communication setting for location launch emails to off.</p>

    <h3>Privacy Settings</h3>
    <p>You have certain privacy controls available in the privacy settings area of our mobile app at <a href="https://www.keycafe.com/mobile#!/privacy" class="wrap">https://www.keycafe.com/mobile#!/privacy</a>. At the time of the last update to this Privacy Policy, you can disable long term storage of GPS device data, disable third-party data enrichment, disable location related surveys, and disable feedback requests. By default you are opted into these programs so that we may provide the best Service possible, so please opt out after registering if you prefer these privacy options be in place. We intend to offer more privacy settings in the future and may initially set your account to the less private option if that was already our default behavior.</p>

    <h3>Device GPS Setting</h3>
    <p>In order to provide certain features, we may require access to location information, including precise geolocation information collected from your device, for example, to verify you are near a Keycafe SmartBox or generate walking directions. You can stop our collection of location information by our app at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you do so, critical features of our mobile application will no longer function.</p>

    <h3>Security Settings</h3>
    <p>We allow you to turn on two factor authentication for your account in your security settings which we highly recommend. You may also manage your API key if you use the Keycafe APIS. We intend to offer more security settings in the future and may initially set your account to the less secure option if that was already our default behavior.</p>

    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>You may access, change, or correct information that you have provided (including profiling decisions we have made such as your language) by logging into your Keycafe account at any time or by making a request to our support team, in which case we may need to verify your identity before granting access or otherwise changing or correcting your information.</p>

    <h3>Cancelling Your Account</h3>
    <p>If you wish to deactivate your account, you can do so by logging into your Keycafe account and using the "Cancel Account" option in your account settings area.</p>

    <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
    <p>Do Not Track ("DNT") is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking across websites. We do not have a mechanism in place to respond to DNT signals. If you wish to minimize trackability of your use, we recommend using the Google Chrome browser in incognito mode.</p>

    <h3>Seeing Your Data</h3>
    <p>Your have the right to see your data. If you wish to see the data we store about you, email privacy@keycafe.com and we will respond within 30 days. Please note that Keycafe is still a small company and must dedicate engineering time to achieving your export. We will ask you to discontinue using the Service if you make a burdensome number of requests.</p>

    <h2 id="changes-to-this-privacy-notice">Changes to this Privacy Notice</h2>
    <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a revised version and updating the "Last Updated" date above. Unless we notify you otherwise, any revised version will be effective 30 days after the Last Updated date. We will provide you with reasonable notice of material changes to the Privacy Policy, including by email if you have provided an email address. If you disagree with these changes, you may cancel your account at any time. Your continued use of our Service constitutes your consent to any amendment of this Privacy Policy.</p>
