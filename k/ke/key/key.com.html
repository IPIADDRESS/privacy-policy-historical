<p><font color=#CC0000 face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>What is the impact of opting out?</strong></font><br><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Opting out limits our ability to share certain information.

<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong><i>Privacy is an important issue. Please read this entire Policy and keep it for your records.</i></strong></font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>This Policy applies to you</strong><br>
<p>This Policy is about our relationships with consumers who ask about and/or obtain products or services from Key for personal, family and household purposes. It applies to the personally identifiable information we maintain about you.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>This Policy applies to all companies within the KeyCorp family of companies listed at the end of this Policy. Some departments or companies within Key may have more restricted information sharing practices than described in this Policy. If Key changes its information sharing practices, we will notify you about any material changes. This Policy supersedes all previous notices or statements about subject matters described in this Policy. </font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Strict security measures</strong><br>
<p>Key takes the security of information very seriously and has established security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to customer information. These standards exist for both our physical facilities and our online services. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard customer information. <br></font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Limited employee access</strong><br>
<p>Key's policies and procedures limit employee access to information to those employees with a business reason for accessing such information. We continually educate employees about the importance of confidentiality and privacy. If employees do not follow these policies and procedures, we take appropriate disciplinary measures.<br></font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Key collects information to:</strong><br></font><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Accurately identify you;<br></font><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Provide you with quality products and services;</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Protect and administer your records, accounts and funds;</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Help us design or improve our products and services; </font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Understand your financial needs;</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Save you time when you apply for new products and services and</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Comply with certain laws and regulations.</font></li>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Key collects information from:</strong><br></font><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Applications and other forms that you give us (for example, name, address, social security number, assets, income and investment objectives);</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>The KeyCorp family of companies on transactions that you have conducted (for example, account balance, payment history, parties to transaction and debit card usage);</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Third parties outside Key, on transactions you've conducted (for example, account balance, payment history, parties to transaction and credit card usage);</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Outside sources such as brokers, dealers and educational institutions, that help us originate products and services (for example, application information and transaction information);</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Credit reporting agencies and demographic data companies (for example, your creditworthiness, credit history and demographic information) and</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Public sources, such as federal, state or local records (for example, mortgage and other lien information).</font></li>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Key has established procedures so that the financial information we collect is accurate, current and complete. Key is committed to working with you to correct any inaccurate information.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Sharing of information</strong><br>
<p>Depending on the type of relationship you have with Key, we may share information among the KeyCorp family of companies, as well as with third parties outside Key. Key reserves the right to share all information we collect as this policy describes.</font><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Sharing within the KeyCorp family </strong>- Key engages in many businesses (for example, banking, mortgage lending, brokerage and investment services, trust administration, asset management and insurance). We share information among these businesses to increase your access to our products and services, to allow us to match our products and services to your specific needs, and to simplify transaction flows. For instance, when you apply for a new product, some of our systems automatically fill in your application form with information that we already have from you. This shortens the process for you. Without this type of information sharing, in most instances, you would need to provide the same information every time you apply for or ask about a Key product or service.</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Sharing with carefully selected companies</strong> - We share information with third parties outside Key so that they may offer you products and services we believe may benefit you. These third parties include:</font></li><ul><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Financial service providers, such as mortgage bankers-brokers, securities broker-dealers, indirect loan originators, correspondent lenders, transaction processors and insurance agent/companies;</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Non-financial companies, such as retailers;</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Others, such as nonprofit organizations.</font></li></ul>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>If we share information with servicers or marketing partners, we require them to treat the information in strict confidence and to use it only for the purpose for which it was shared.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Permitted information sharing regardless of opt out</strong><br>
<p>It is important to understand that even if you opt out of information sharing - if you decide that you do not want Key to share - the law still allows Key to share information about you as follows:</p></font><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>With other KeyCorp companies</strong> - We are permitted to share with other companies in the KeyCorp family identification information and information on our transactions and experiences with you.</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>To our outside marketing partners</strong> - We are permitted to share information with our partners outside Key that help us market our products and services. We may also share information with other financial institutions whose products or services we jointly market.</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>With others, as the law allows</strong> - We also are permitted to share information about you with other KeyCorp companies and to third parties outside Key, when the law allows. For example, we may provide information to KeyCorp companies or third parties outside Key:</font></li><ul><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>That perform services for us, such as loan servicing, data analysis, bill payment, account aggregation services, e-mail services, mail house services, printing and account statementing; </font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>To complete transactions you have initiated;</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>To service, process or enforce your account or agreement with us; </font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>To protect the rights, property or safety of Key, our customers or others (such as to protect against fraud and to reduce credit risk); </font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>To comply with a legal requirement or process; </font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>To comply with your request or authorization to share information;</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>To furnish information to consumer reporting agencies.</font></li></ul>                  
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Former customers</strong><br>If you end your relationship with Key, we will still respect the information practices in our Policy. Your opt out decision stays in effect.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Protecting your information online</strong><br>Key partners with certain third parties to deliver online products and services. If you request information through key.com, Key and certain third parties may retain certain information you provide in order to deliver these services. Information may be retained from online tools and calculators, online applications and forms, online service subscriptions, or transactions conducted online (e.g. internet or wireless device). To ensure that online banking and/or online application for products and services is confidential, we use technology that encrypts, or scrambles, information so that it transfers privately between you and Key's network. Additionally, your unique login ID and password protect online banking information.</font></p><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Account aggregation</strong> - If you subscribe to our account aggregation service, Key will collect and display Key and non-Key account data for you. Key may use this data in aggregate form (information about you grouped with other consumers' information, which cannot be used to identify you) to help us better understand general consumer behavior. With your permission, Key may use the data to market certain products or services to consumers.</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Online surveys</strong> - This information is used solely for research purposes to help us develop a superior Web site. The information stays in aggregate form and does not identify you.</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>E-mail</strong> - If you agree to receive e-mail from Key, we will keep the information you give us and use it to send you e-mail messages that specifically interest you. If you choose to send us e-mail, we may keep the content of your e-mail message, your e-mail address, and our response. Please be careful about the information you e-mail to us, because e-mail to us and any other public web site can sometimes be intercepted.</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Cookies</strong> - A &quot;cookie&quot; allows Key to determine that a visit has occurred within our site, as well as which pages were viewed. Cookies are also needed as a security measure when you bank online. Cookies are common on Web sites and do not harm your computer. Key uses temporary cookies that do NOT transmit any personal information about you and are deleted from your hard disk when you close the browser.</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Information from children online</strong> - Protecting the identities of children and their activities online is important. Key does not market online products and services to children. Additionally, we take measures to avoid collecting information from children online.</font></li>                  
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Additional rights</strong><br>You may have other privacy protections under state laws. Our information practices comply with these laws.</font><br><br></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>YOUR OPTIONS</strong><br><br>If you prefer that Key not share information about you, you may restrict us from doing so. If you restrict us from sharing information, it means you &quot;opt out&quot; of information sharing. <strong>Opting out of information sharing does not prohibit Key from contacting you about additional products or services. It only restricts us from sharing information within the KeyCorp family of companies and/or with third parties outside Key.</strong> The types of information that we may share, and the categories of companies with which we may share it, are discussed in this Policy. Opting out only applies to individual consumers who have obtained or sought out products or services for personal, family or household purposes. </font>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>If you wish to opt out of information sharing, your election can apply to either external information sharing or internal information sharing, or both. Even if you opt out, we may still continue to share information as explained in the &quot;Permitted information sharing regardless of opt out&quot; section above. External and internal information sharing are described below. </font><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>External Sharing</strong> - Third parties outside Key: You have the right to opt out of information sharing with third party companies that are not part of the KeyCorp family of companies. </font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Internal Sharing</strong> - KeyCorp family of companies: You also have the right to opt out of information sharing among the KeyCorp family of companies. If you limit the information Key may share within its corporate family, it may restrict our ability to provide you with the best and most comprehensive products and services. For example, we may not be able to offer you certain combined products and statements, or offer you more competitive products that may be available to you based on your total Key relationship. </font></li>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Your election to opt out will apply to all products and services you obtain within the KeyCorp family of companies for personal, family or household purposes, either by yourself or jointly with others. If you have a product or service jointly with another person(s), each of you may opt out individually; each of you may also opt out for each other. If you opt out, we may share information about a joint party or joint parties unless you or someone else authorized to do so has opted out for that party.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>To opt out, to change your election, or for more information</strong><br><strong>If you wish to opt out of information sharing, would like to change a previous election, or would like more information about your options, please call 1-800-361-0968. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Your relationship with Key is a way for you to gain access to complete, customized financial solutions. We offer innovative products and personal attention. At the same time, we work hard to protect the confidentiality and security of information. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with the financial products and services you need.</font></p>

<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FOR VERMONT RESIDENTS</strong></font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>This Supplemental Information modifies and supercedes certain provisions of KeyCorp's Privacy Policy for Vermont residents. Except as modified below, the provisions of Key's Privacy Policy apply to Vermont residents.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>For Vermont residents, the &quot;opt out&quot; procedures to limit information sharing described in Key's Privacy Policy do not apply. Instead, unless you &quot;opt in&quot; to information sharing, we will not disclose information about you to nonaffiliated third parties or to other KeyCorp companies, except as described below under &quot;Permitted Information Sharing Regardless of Opt In.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Permitted Information Sharing Regardless of Opt In</strong><br>It is important to understand that even if you do not opt in to information sharing, Key is still permitted by law to disclose information about you in the following circumstances:</font></p><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>To other KeyCorp companies. </strong> We may disclose to other companies in the KeyCorp family identification information and information on our own transactions and experiences with you.</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>To our nonaffiliated marketing partners. </strong>We may disclose information about you to nonaffiliated third parties that help us to market our own products and services, as well as to other financial institutions with whom we jointly market their products or services. However, the information we may share about you with other financial institutions to jointly market products will be limited to your contact information (such as name, address and phone number) and information about your transactions and experiences with the KeyCorp family of companies. </font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>With others, as permitted by law. </strong>We may also disclose information about you to other KeyCorp companies and to nonaffiliated third parties when it is permitted by law. For example, we may provide information to affiliated or nonaffiliated third parties that perform services on our behalf, such as loan servicing, data analytics, bill payment, account aggregation services, e-mail services, mail house services, printing and account statementing; to complete transactions you have initiated; to service, process or enforce your account or agreement with us; to protect the rights, property or safety of Key, our customers or others (such as for fraud protection and credit risk reduction); to comply with a legal requirement or process; to comply with your request or authorization to disclose; or to consumer reporting agencies.</font></li>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Opt In to Additional Information Sharing</strong><br>If you wish to opt in to authorize sharing of information in addition to the permitted sharing described above, your opt in authorization can apply to either external information sharing or internal information sharing, or both. External and internal information sharing are described below.</font></p><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>External Sharing - Nonaffiliated third parties. </strong>You may elect to opt in to information sharing with nonaffiliated third parties (companies that are not part of the KeyCorp family of companies), in addition to those nonaffiliated third parties with which we are otherwise permitted by law to share information, as described above. These additional nonaffiliated third parties may offer you other financial or nonfinancial products and services that could benefit you.</font></li><li><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Internal Sharing - KeyCorp family of companies. </strong>You may elect to opt in to the sharing of all information we have concerning you among the KeyCorp family of companies not limited to the information with which we are otherwise permitted by law to share with our affiliates, as described above. Sharing full information among Key's family of companies increases your access to our products and services, allows us to match our products and services to your specific needs, as well as simplifies transaction flows.</font></li>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Your election(s) to opt in will apply to all products and services you obtain within the KeyCorp family of companies for personal, family or household purposes.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Joint Accounts</strong><br>If you have a product or service jointly with another person(s), we will not disclose information about the joint account pursuant to an opt in authorization, except as otherwise permitted by law, unless all joint accountholders have opted in. </font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Health or Medical Information</strong><br>Regardless of whether you have opted in, we will not share any personal health or medical information we may have without your written consent or otherwise as permitted by law. Health or medical information may include insurance application information, other health information you may provide in connection with one or more existing accounts, or information provided to us with regard to an insurance claim.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>For More Information, to Opt In or to Revoke a Previous Opt In</strong><br>If you would like more information about your options, or wish to opt in to information sharing, please call our dedicated Privacy Line toll free at <strong>1-800-361-0968</strong> to request a pre-printed opt in form be mailed to you. If you opt in to information sharing and later wish to revoke that election, you may do so at any time by calling our toll free Privacy Line to change your preference.<br></font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Please note: The automatic opt out of information sharing we record on your behalf to comply with Vermont state law will continue for as long as our records indicate you are a Vermont resident. If our records show you no longer reside in Vermont, your information sharing status will revert back to the sharing preference you directly elected with Key. For example, if at any time you had called Key to opt out of information sharing, that preference will then be effective once the automatic opt out is removed. However, if you have not directly recorded an opt out preference with Key, and you want to continue to restrict information sharing after moving outside Vermont, you must do so by calling our Privacy Line.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1><strong>Please retain a copy of this Supplemental Information, together with the KeyCorp Privacy Policy, for your records. This Supplemental Information may be amended from time to time. You will be notified in writing of any changes.</strong><br></font></p><p align=right><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>80-0405VT (3/7/2002)</font></p>">

<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>This Policy applies to you</strong><br>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">This Policy is about our relationships with consumers who ask about and/or obtain products or services from Key for personal, family and household purposes. It applies to the personally identifiable information we maintain about you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">This Policy applies to all companies within the KeyCorp family of companies listed at the end of this Policy. Some departments or companies within Key may have more restricted information sharing practices than described in this Policy. If Key changes its information sharing practices, we will notify you about any material changes. This Policy supersedes all previous notices or statements about subject matters described in this Policy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Strict security measures</strong><br>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Key takes the security of information very seriously and has established security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to customer information. These standards exist for both our physical facilities and our online services. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard customer information. <br></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Limited employee access</strong><br>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Key's policies and procedures limit employee access to information to those employees with a business reason for accessing such information. We continually educate employees about the importance of confidentiality and privacy. If employees do not follow these policies and procedures, we take appropriate disciplinary measures.<br></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Key collects information to:</strong><br></font></p><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Accurately identify you;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Provide you with quality products and services;</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Protect and administer your records, accounts and funds;</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Help us design or improve our products and services; </font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Understand your financial needs;</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Save you time when you apply for new products and services and</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Comply with certain laws and regulations.</font></li>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Key collects information from:</strong><br></font></p><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Applications and other forms that you give us (for example, name, address, social security number, assets, income and investment objectives);</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">The KeyCorp family of companies on transactions that you have conducted (for example, account balance, payment history, parties to transaction and debit card usage);</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Third parties outside Key, on transactions you've conducted (for example, account balance, payment history, parties to transaction and credit card usage);</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Outside sources such as brokers, dealers and educational institutions, that help us originate products and services (for example, application information and transaction information);</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Credit reporting agencies and demographic data companies (for example, your creditworthiness, credit history and demographic information) and</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Public sources, such as federal, state or local records (for example, mortgage and other lien information).</font></li>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Key has established procedures so that the financial information we collect is accurate, current and complete. Key is committed to working with you to correct any inaccurate information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Sharing of information</strong><br>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Depending on the type of relationship you have with Key, we may share information among the KeyCorp family of companies, as well as with third parties outside Key. Key reserves the right to share all information we collect as this policy describes.</font></p><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Sharing within the KeyCorp family </strong>- Key engages in many businesses (for example, banking, mortgage lending, brokerage and investment services, trust administration, asset management and insurance). We share information among these businesses to increase your access to our products and services, to allow us to match our products and services to your specific needs, and to simplify transaction flows. For instance, when you apply for a new product, some of our systems automatically fill in your application form with information that we already have from you. This shortens the process for you. Without this type of information sharing, in most instances, you would need to provide the same information every time you apply for or ask about a Key product or service.</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Sharing with carefully selected companies</strong> - We share information with third parties outside Key so that they may offer you products and services we believe may benefit you. These third parties include:</font></li><ul><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Financial service providers, such as mortgage bankers-brokers, securities broker-dealers, indirect loan originators, correspondent lenders, transaction processors and insurance agent/companies;</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Non-financial companies, such as retailers;</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Others, such as nonprofit organizations.</font></li></ul>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">If we share information with servicers or marketing partners, we require them to treat the information in strict confidence and to use it only for the purpose for which it was shared.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Permitted information sharing regardless of opt out</strong><br>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">It is important to understand that even if you opt out of information sharing - if you decide that you do not want Key to share - the law still allows Key to share information about you as follows:</font></p><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>With other KeyCorp companies</strong> - We are permitted to share with other companies in the KeyCorp family identification information and information on our transactions and experiences with you.</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>To our outside marketing partners</strong> - We are permitted to share information with our partners outside Key that help us market our products and services. We may also share information with other financial institutions whose products or services we jointly market.</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>With others, as the law allows</strong> - We also are permitted to share information about you with other KeyCorp companies and to third parties outside Key, when the law allows. For example, we may provide information to KeyCorp companies or third parties outside Key:</font></li><ul><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">That perform services for us, such as loan servicing, data analysis, bill payment, account aggregation services, e-mail services, mail house services, printing and account statementing; </font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">To complete transactions you have initiated;</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">To service, process or enforce your account or agreement with us; </font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">To protect the rights, property or safety of Key, our customers or others (such as to protect against fraud and to reduce credit risk); </font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">To comply with a legal requirement or process; </font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">To comply with your request or authorization to share information;</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">To furnish information to consumer reporting agencies.</font></li></ul>                  
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Former customers</strong><br>If you end your relationship with Key, we will still respect the information practices in our Policy. Your opt out decision stays in effect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Protecting your information online</strong><br>Key partners with certain third parties to deliver online products and services. If you request information through key.com, Key and certain third parties may retain certain information you provide in order to deliver these services. Information may be retained from online tools and calculators, online applications and forms, online service subscriptions, or transactions conducted online (e.g. internet or wireless device). To ensure that online banking and/or online application for products and services is confidential, we use technology that encrypts, or scrambles, information so that it transfers privately between you and Key's network. Additionally, your unique login ID and password protect online banking information.</font></p><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Account aggregation</strong> - If you subscribe to our account aggregation service, Key will collect and display Key and non-Key account data for you. Key may use this data in aggregate form (information about you grouped with other consumers' information, which cannot be used to identify you) to help us better understand general consumer behavior. With your permission, Key may use the data to market certain products or services to consumers.</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Online surveys</strong> - This information is used solely for research purposes to help us develop a superior Web site. The information stays in aggregate form and does not identify you.</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>E-mail</strong> - If you agree to receive e-mail from Key, we will keep the information you give us and use it to send you e-mail messages that specifically interest you. If you choose to send us e-mail, we may keep the content of your e-mail message, your e-mail address, and our response. Please be careful about the information you e-mail to us, because e-mail to us and any other public web site can sometimes be intercepted.</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Cookies</strong> - A "cookie" allows Key to determine that a visit has occurred within our site, as well as which pages were viewed. Cookies are also needed as a security measure when you bank online. Cookies are common on Web sites and do not harm your computer. Key uses temporary cookies that do NOT transmit any personal information about you and are deleted from your hard disk when you close the browser.</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Information from children online</strong> - Protecting the identities of children and their activities online is important. Key does not market online products and services to children. Additionally, we take measures to avoid collecting information from children online.</font></li>                  
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Additional rights</strong><br>You may have other privacy protections under state laws. Our information practices comply with these laws.</font><br><br></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>YOUR OPTIONS</strong><br><br>If you prefer that Key not share information about you, you may restrict us from doing so. If you restrict us from sharing information, it means you "opt out" of information sharing. <strong>Opting out of information sharing does not prohibit Key from contacting you about additional products or services. It only restricts us from sharing information within the KeyCorp family of companies and/or with third parties outside Key.</strong> The types of information that we may share, and the categories of companies with which we may share it, are discussed in this Policy. Opting out only applies to individual consumers who have obtained or sought out products or services for personal, family or household purposes. </font>
</p><p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">If you wish to opt out of information sharing, your election can apply to either external information sharing or internal information sharing, or both. Even if you opt out, we may still continue to share information as explained in the "Permitted information sharing regardless of opt out" section above. External and internal information sharing are described below. </font></p><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>External Sharing</strong> - Third parties outside Key: You have the right to opt out of information sharing with third party companies that are not part of the KeyCorp family of companies. </font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Internal Sharing</strong> - KeyCorp family of companies: You also have the right to opt out of information sharing among the KeyCorp family of companies. If you limit the information Key may share within its corporate family, it may restrict our ability to provide you with the best and most comprehensive products and services. For example, we may not be able to offer you certain combined products and statements, or offer you more competitive products that may be available to you based on your total Key relationship. </font></li>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Your election to opt out will apply to all products and services you obtain within the KeyCorp family of companies for personal, family or household purposes, either by yourself or jointly with others. If you have a product or service jointly with another person(s), each of you may opt out individually; each of you may also opt out for each other. If you opt out, we may share information about a joint party or joint parties unless you or someone else authorized to do so has opted out for that party.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>To opt out, to change your election, or for more information</strong><br><strong>If you wish to opt out of information sharing, would like to change a previous election, or would like more information about your options, please call 1-800-361-0968. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Your relationship with Key is a way for you to gain access to complete, customized financial solutions. We offer innovative products and personal attention. At the same time, we work hard to protect the confidentiality and security of information. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with the financial products and services you need.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>This Supplemental Information modifies and supercedes certain provisions of KeyCorp's Privacy Policy for Vermont residents. Except as modified below, the provisions of Key's Privacy Policy apply to Vermont residents.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">For Vermont residents, the "opt out" procedures to limit information sharing described in Key's Privacy Policy do not apply. Instead, unless you "opt in" to information sharing, we will not disclose information about you to nonaffiliated third parties or to other KeyCorp companies, except as described below under "Permitted Information Sharing Regardless of Opt In."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Permitted Information Sharing Regardless of Opt In</strong><br>It is important to understand that even if you do not opt in to information sharing, Key is still permitted by law to disclose information about you in the following circumstances:</font></p><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>To other KeyCorp companies. </strong> We may disclose to other companies in the KeyCorp family identification information and information on our own transactions and experiences with you.</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>To our nonaffiliated marketing partners. </strong>We may disclose information about you to nonaffiliated third parties that help us to market our own products and services, as well as to other financial institutions with whom we jointly market their products or services. However, the information we may share about you with other financial institutions to jointly market products will be limited to your contact information (such as name, address and phone number) and information about your transactions and experiences with the KeyCorp family of companies. </font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>With others, as permitted by law. </strong>We may also disclose information about you to other KeyCorp companies and to nonaffiliated third parties when it is permitted by law. For example, we may provide information to affiliated or nonaffiliated third parties that perform services on our behalf, such as loan servicing, data analytics, bill payment, account aggregation services, e-mail services, mail house services, printing and account statementing; to complete transactions you have initiated; to service, process or enforce your account or agreement with us; to protect the rights, property or safety of Key, our customers or others (such as for fraud protection and credit risk reduction); to comply with a legal requirement or process; to comply with your request or authorization to disclose; or to consumer reporting agencies.</font></li>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Opt In to Additional Information Sharing</strong><br>If you wish to opt in to authorize sharing of information in addition to the permitted sharing described above, your opt in authorization can apply to either external information sharing or internal information sharing, or both. External and internal information sharing are described below.</font></p><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>External Sharing - Nonaffiliated third parties. </strong>You may elect to opt in to information sharing with nonaffiliated third parties (companies that are not part of the KeyCorp family of companies), in addition to those nonaffiliated third parties with which we are otherwise permitted by law to share information, as described above. These additional nonaffiliated third parties may offer you other financial or nonfinancial products and services that could benefit you.</font></li><li><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Internal Sharing - KeyCorp family of companies. </strong>You may elect to opt in to the sharing of all information we have concerning you among the KeyCorp family of companies not limited to the information with which we are otherwise permitted by law to share with our affiliates, as described above. Sharing full information among Key's family of companies increases your access to our products and services, allows us to match our products and services to your specific needs, as well as simplifies transaction flows.</font></li>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Your election(s) to opt in will apply to all products and services you obtain within the KeyCorp family of companies for personal, family or household purposes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Joint Accounts</strong><br>If you have a product or service jointly with another person(s), we will not disclose information about the joint account pursuant to an opt in authorization, except as otherwise permitted by law, unless all joint accountholders have opted in. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>Health or Medical Information</strong><br>Regardless of whether you have opted in, we will not share any personal health or medical information we may have without your written consent or otherwise as permitted by law. Health or medical information may include insurance application information, other health information you may provide in connection with one or more existing accounts, or information provided to us with regard to an insurance claim.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1"><strong>For More Information, to Opt In or to Revoke a Previous Opt In</strong><br>If you would like more information about your options, or wish to opt in to information sharing, please call our dedicated Privacy Line toll free at <strong>1-800-361-0968</strong> to request a pre-printed opt in form be mailed to you. If you opt in to information sharing and later wish to revoke that election, you may do so at any time by calling our toll free Privacy Line to change your preference.<br></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial," helvetica,="" sans-serif="" size="-1">Please note: The automatic opt out of information sharing we record on your behalf to comply with Vermont state law will continue for as long as our records indicate you are a Vermont resident. If our records show you no longer reside in Vermont, your information sharing status will revert back to the sharing preference you directly elected with Key. For example, if at any time you had called Key to opt out of information sharing, that preference will then be effective once the automatic opt out is removed. However, if you have not directly recorded an opt out preference with Key, and you want to continue to restrict information sharing after moving outside Vermont, you must do so by calling our Privacy Line.</font></p>
