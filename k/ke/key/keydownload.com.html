      KeyDownload is committed to protecting your privacy. The following privacy policy discloses our information-gathering and dissemination practices for our website and our service. By using our website or our service, you agree to be bound by the terms of this policy. 
      
      
<p>
<strong>Personal Information</strong><br>



Personal information is information that is unique to you (such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card number). We may collect such personal information from you via our service. Because protecting your information is important to us, we do not sell any personal information to third parties. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Information Automatically Logged</strong><br>


Our systems may automatically log certain non-personal information such as your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to help administer our service or to perform analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>


Our services may involve the use of cookies to store information about your visits. In addition, during the course of providing advertisements to this site, third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer's hard drive. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Security</strong><br>


We will take commercially reasonable measures in providing secure transmission of your personal information before it is transferred across the Internet from your personal computer to our servers and in securing such personal information stored on our systems. However, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet and that there is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of personal information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 
</p>
