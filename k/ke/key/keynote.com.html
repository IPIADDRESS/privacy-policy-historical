Keynote Systems provides subscription- and contract-based Internet performance measurement and 
analysis services to companies that operate business web sites. Keynote also provides web-site 
performance indexes for publicly-accessible web sites, and publishes these indexes both online 
and in printed trade publications.

<b><font face="Arial" size="+1" color="#006699">Use of General Customer Data</font></b>
</p><ul>
<li>Keynote will not reveal to any customer what URLs or 
transactions another customer is measuring.
</li><li>Keynote will not reveal to any customer any proprietary 
consulting reports.
</li></ul>
<b><font face="Arial" size="+1" color="#006699">Use of Performance Measurements</font></b>
<ul>
<li> Keynote will not share any data about a site that is 
under development and therefore not public.
</li><li> From time to time, Keynote may use, distribute or sell 
the use of the performance data obtained from measuring any URL or transaction on the Internet 
that either
<ul>
<li> is publicly accessible without special passwords to any user with a web browser or 
</li><li> requires a special password that Keynote legitimately obtains for its own account.
</li></ul>
</li><li>If anyone contracts Keynote to collect measurement data 
that requires a password known only to them, we will not distribute or otherwise use that 
performance data without their permission.
</li></ul>
<b><font face="Arial" size="+1" color="#006699">Web Visitor Information Collected</font></b> 
<p>
We collect only the domain name, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, 
aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, user-specific information on what 
pages consumers access or visit and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey 
information and/or site registrations.
</p><p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="+1" color="#006699">Use of Web Visitor Information Collected Via Online Forms and Surveys</font></b>
</p><p>
Visitor information collected via online forms and surveys is made available only for internal use 
by Keynote, for research and marketing purposes.
