        <strong>(Online Privacy Policy Last update 25 April 2008) </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        “BLUE INFINITY” has established this Privacy Policy to explain how it protects and
        manages the personal information that it collects from you (the customer) online.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Consent for Collection, Use and Disclosure </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your use of the “BLUE INFINITY” site and/or your registration for “BLUE INFINITY”
        products and services constitute your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
        If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the “BLUE
        INFINITY” site.
    </p>
    <p>
        “BLUE INFINITY” may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When it does, “BLUE
        INFINITY” will also revise the “last update” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
        In addition, “BLUE INFINITY” will seek a customer’s prior consent, by email, for
        any new uses or proposed disclosures of information collected from the customer
        prior to the change.
    </p>
    <p>
        “BLUE INFINITY” will notify customers by email of changes to this policy that will
        affect information collected from them in the future. In certain circumstances,
        however, “BLUE INFINITY” will not inform and obtain the consent of the customer,
        such as in connection with an investigation of a breach of an agreement, contravention
        of laws, an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened,
        the collection of a debt or in compliance with the request of a law enforcement
        agency or a court order.
    </p>
    <p>
        A customer may withdraw his or her consent for collection, use and disclosure at
        any time by contacting us at http://help.blueinfinity.net Please note that, if you
        do, “BLUE INFINITY” may suspend its provision of products and services to you. When
        you unsubscribe, if you fall within the guarantee period for any “BLUE INFINITY”
        product and you request a refund, the guarantee will be honoured.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. Accountability </strong>

        web site, certain “personal information” (information that personally identifies
        you) including but not limited to your name, email address, home or work address,
        telephone number, and information about your computer hardware and software (e.g.,
        IP address, operating system, browser type, domain name, URL, access times, and
        referring web site addresses).
    </p>
    <p>
        “BLUE INFINITY” has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information
        received from its customers, and to respond to any inquiries. The Privacy Policy
        also provides that “BLUE INFINITY” will use appropriate contractual means to establish
        a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for processing
        by third parties on “BLUE INFINITY’s” behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
        “BLUE INFINITY” has designated responsibility for your personal information to its

        Other “BLUE INFINITY” individuals may be delegated to act on behalf of the Privacy
        Officer,.

        Purposes:

        that govern your use of the “BLUE INFINITY” site or any “BLUE INFINITY” product
        or service;
    </p>

        promotional purposes. If we hire other companies to provide some products or services
        on our behalf, then we will only provide those companies the personal information
        they need for the Identified Purposes, and we will limit their rights to use and
        further disclose your personal information as appropriate in the course of their
        work for us.

        and services you have already purchased so that “BLUE INFINITY” does not provide
        redundant information to you, and, if you are an “BLUE INFINITY” affiliate, to track
        “BLUE INFINITY” sales made to customers referred by you so that you can receive
        compensation under our affiliate program. If you choose to not have your browser
        accept cookies from the “BLUE INFINITY” web site, you may not be able to view all

        on “BLUE INFINITY’S” behalf for any of the Identified Purposes;
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) as necessary if “BLUE INFINITY” has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary
        to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury
        to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with “Blue Infinity’s”rights
        or property, other users of “Blue Infinity’s”web site, products or services, or
        anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and
    </p>
    <p>
        (d) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies
        or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted
        by law, or otherwise as required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliates may sell
        or buy other businesses or entities, or we may merge with another company. In such
        transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets.
        Also, in the event that “BLUE INFINITY” or substantially all of its assets are acquired,
        your personal information may be one of the transferred assets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your information may be stored and processed in South Africa, Slovenia, the United
        States, or in any other country in which “BLUE INFINITY” or its affiliates, subsidiaries
        or agents maintain facilities.

    <p>
        By using this web site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside
        of your country.
    </p>
    <p>
        After your account becomes inactive (that is, if you request to be removed from
        our database), “BLUE INFINITY” will keep your personal information in its archives.
        Your information will then be used only as necessary for tax reasons or to prove
        “Blue Infinity’s” compliance with any applicable law.

        If “BLUE INFINITY” is not able to provide access to some aspect of a customers personal
        information, it will provide reasons for denying access such as; that by doing so
        would likely reveal personal information about a third party, or that it is confidential
