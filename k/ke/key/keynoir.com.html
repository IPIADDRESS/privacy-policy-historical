  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h3>
    This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from
    you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.
  </h3>

  <p>
    For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), the data 
    controller is Keynoir Limited.
  </p>

  <h3>Information we may collect from you</h3>

  <p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site (including 
      without limitation email details). This includes information provided at 
      the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service,
      posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for
      information, and when you report a problem with our site.
    </li>

    <li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>

    <li>
      We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research
      purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.
    </li>

    <li>Details of transactions you carry out through our site.</li>

    <li>
      Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic 
      data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this
      is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources 
      that you access.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>IP addresses and cookies</h3>

  <p>
    We may collect information about your computer, including where available
    your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system
    administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. 
    This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns,
    and does not identify any individual.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet 
    usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your 
    computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your 
    computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a
    better and more personalised service. They enable us:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.</li>

    <li>
      To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to
      customise our site according to your individual interests.
    </li>

    <li>To speed up your searches.</li>

    <li>To recognise you when you return to our site.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser
    which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select 
    this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless 
    you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our
    system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have 
    no control.
  </p>

  <h3>Where we store your personal data</h3>

  <p>
    The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a 
    destination outside the European Economic Area ('EEA'). It may also be 
    processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of
    our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the 
    fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the
    provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree
    to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably
    necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance
    with this privacy policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any
    payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not 
    completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
    data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our 
    site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your 
    information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to 
    prevent unauthorised access.
  </p>

  <h3>Uses made of the information</h3>

  <p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective 
      manner for you and for your computer.
    </li>

    <li>
      To provide you with information, products or services that you request
      from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be
      contacted for such purposes.
    </li>

    <li>
      To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into
      between you and us.
    </li>

    <li>
      To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when 
      you choose to do so.
    </li>

    <li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your 
    data, to provide you with information about goods and services which may 
    be of interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by email,
    SMS, post or telephone.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are an existing subscriber, we will only contact you by electronic
    means (e-mail or SMS) with information about services similar to those to
    which you subscribe or have otherwise expressed a preference for.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a new subscriber, and where we permit selected third parties to
    use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if 
    you have consented to this.

    to that target audience.
  </p>

  <h3>Disclosure of your information</h3>

  <p>
    We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group from
    time to time, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company 
    and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act
    1985.
  </p>

  <p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case
      we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of 
      such business or assets.
    </li>

    <li>
      If we sell all or substantially all of our assets and are acquired by a 
      third party, in which case personal data held by it about its subscribers
      will be one of the transferred assets.
    </li>

    <li>
      If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order
      to comply with any legal obligation, valid request from a governmental 
      authority, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and
      other agreements; or to protect our rights, our property, or safety of 
      our subscribers, or others. This includes exchanging information with
      other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection 
      and credit risk reduction.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Your rights</h3>

  <p>
    You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for

    disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can
    exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on 
    the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at
    any time by contacting us at
