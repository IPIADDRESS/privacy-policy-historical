    <div class="content"><p>Ketchum, Inc. (“Ketchum”), has created this privacy policy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering, use and dissemination practices solely for the Web site located at www.ketchum.com (the "Site").  <br>
<br>
By using or accessing the Site, you signify your assent to our Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE.      <br>
<br>
Personal and Non-Personal Information: When using the Site, you may be asked to provide, or you may choose to upload, certain personally identifiable information about yourself ("Personal Information"). This may include information that you submit to be considered for a position with Ketchum. Personal Information can include your name, e-mail address, physical address and telephone number.      <br>
<br>
In addition, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as IP host address, pages viewed, browser type and other data, and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual ("Aggregate Information").       <br>
<br>
Personal Information Usage: Unless disclosed otherwise at the time of collection, we do not share any Personal Information you submit through our Site with any unaffiliated third party, unless it is necessary to respond to your inquiry, or to comply with applicable law. If you submit Personal Information to Ketchum in connection with seeking a position with Ketchum, then we may share this information with third parties as necessary to evaluate your application and consider your appropriateness for work with Ketchum.      <br>
<br>
We will never sell your Personal Information to any third party not affiliated with Ketchum without your consent except in connection with the sale or merger of Ketchum or the division responsible for such services. <br>
<br>
Please note that we reserve the right to access and/or disclose Personal Information as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Site rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper.       <br>
<br>
Aggregate Information Usage:  We may use Aggregate Information to improve and enhance your experience on the Site and for our market research activities. For example, we may share Aggregate Information with unaffiliated third parties, such as business partners and clients, in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the shared information will not contain nor be linked to any Personal Information.        <br>
<br>
Clickstream:  As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each Web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a Web site''s server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the Web site from which you linked to the Site. We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of Aggregate Information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our Web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Site and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not intentionally contain any Personal Information. <br>
<br>
Security: The security of your Personal Information is very important to us. We attempt to provide for the secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers by utilizing encryption software. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Ketchum, or information stored on the Site or our servers, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of the Site demonstrates your assumption of this risk. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are authorized to have access to your Personal Information.          <br>
<br>
Protection for Children: We have no intention of collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. When we become aware that personal information from a child under 13 has been collected without such child’s parent or guardian’s consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.          <br>
<br>
Other Web Sites: Our Site may contain links to other Web sites not maintained by Ketchum. Other Web sites may also reference or link to our Site. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site, or surf the Internet, and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that you visit. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other Web sites.         <br>
<br>
Changes to policy; Opt-out Process:  We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use Personal Information in a way that differs from this policy, we will post such changes here and provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes.       <br>
<br>
If you receive an unwanted e-mail from us, you can simply reply and ask not to receive future e-mails. We also give you the option to remove your personal information from our list of active users completely. All unsubscribe or opt-out requests should be sent to us at editor@ketchum.com and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt.
