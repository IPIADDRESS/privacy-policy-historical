              At Blockdot, Inc.. ("Blockdot"), we respect your right to privacy and we understand
              that visitors to Blockdot Sites need to control the uses of their personal information.
              The privacy policy below details the measures taken by Blockdot to protect your
              privacy in connection with your use of <a href="http://www.kewlbox.com" target="_blank">
                  www.kewlbox.com</a>, <a href="http://www.blockdot.com" target="_blank">www.blockdot.com</a>,
              and other sites owned and operated by Blockdot ("Blockdot Sites"). Blockdot does
              not intend to collect any personal information from children under 13 unless Blockdot
              believes such collection to be permitted by law; please read below for Blockdot's
              policy with respect to children under 13.<br><br>
          </p>
      
          <p>
              <b>HOW IS MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION USED BY BLOCKDOT?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Customized experience.</b> Blockdot gathers user information to provide you with
              a customized experience on our sites. Your user information helps us tailor the
              content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this
              reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information when you post
              high scores, write reviews, download free software, enter a contest, order products,
              subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas of an Blockdot site. If you
              choose not to register you may not have access to areas that require personal identification.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>E-mail.</b> If you register with our site or purchase products from us, from
              time to time we may e-mail you with messages about our services or third party products
              and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new products, features,
              services, special offers and updated information. The newsletters may contain code
              that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether
              the email was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that
              information with other information we have about you and may use that information
              to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications
              to you. In addition, if you register with a Blockdot site or purchase products you
              may automatically receive emails confirming your registration and/or purchase and
              providing you with necessary information relating to the access or use of your registration
              and/or purchase. With the exception of the emails described in the preceding sentence
              which are necessary to provide customer support and deliver products and services
              to you, you may opt-out of receiving email from us as described below under "What
              are my options to control the use of my personally identifiable information?".<br><br>
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>WHEN DOES BLOCKDOT COLLECT MY INFORMATION, INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Registration.</b> When you register, Blockdot asks for your e-mail address, a
              user selected user name, and other information. Once you are a registered user you
              can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential information
              (e.g. a member name, a nickname, and certain user preferences). <a href="#child">(Blockdot's
                  policy with respect to children under 13 is below)</a>
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Order Forms and Products Store.</b> Blockdot also uses an order form for users
              to request information, products and services. For that order form, we collect a
              user's contact information (e-mail address) and necessary financial information
              to process the order (i.e. credit card number). Contact information from the order
              (including email) is used to deliver digital products and information from Blockdot.
              Blockdot may use third parties to accept and process orders and credit card purchases
              for merchandise and products, including software.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Special Contests or Promotions. </b>Blockdot may occasionally present a special
              contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry
              in that contest or promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information. If
              we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s) or with others, we will provide
              a statement to that effect in the contest or promotion terms.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>IP Address.</b> All communication on the internet takes place between pairs of
              IP Addresses. Our Web servers will log the IP address that any connection is made
              from. We may use these IP addresses to help diagnose technical problems or prevent
              abuse of our systems or other site users. Your IP address may also be used to gather
              aggregate demographic data and target advertisements accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Cookies.</b> A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web
              browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us provide better service to you.
              Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie
              is sent. We use cookies to save your password (in an encrypted format) on your machine
              so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We also use cookies
              to deliver content specific to your interests and track your downloads and purchases
              from the Blockdot Sites.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Banner Advertisements.</b> We use various outside companies to serve advertisements
              on our site. In the process of serving advertisements, the ad serving companies
              place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information (excluding
              your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this
              and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other Web
              sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads
              on the Blockdot Sites, the ad server is able to record what ads a user -- identified
              by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what Blockdot site pages the user was viewing
              when the ads were delivered. This Web usage information is combined with other ad
              delivery information the ad server has collected from your visits to Blockdot Sites
              and other sites not affiliated with Blockdot. This non-personally identifiable information
              is used as part of the ad serving process for reporting and to select and direct
              the ads you see online at Blockdot Sites and other sites not affiliated with Blockdot.
              Unlike the cookies Blockdot uses in other parts of our site, cookies received with
              banner ads are collected by Falk NA and we do not have access to this information.
              Additionally, some ads served by Blockdot ad system are generated by third party
              ad serving systems that also may place a cookie on your browser to provide web usage
              information to those third parties. To find out more about those specific third
              party ad serving systems, please click to their sites below:

              <b>Web Logs.</b> Web logs automatically record anything a web server sees, which
              may include email addresses you enter into a form or pages viewed by a user at a

              you have elected to Opt-Out of receiving email from us, we will not use the information
              from web logs to market to you. If you are a registered user of a Blockdot Site

              <b>WHO DOES BLOCKDOT SHARE INFORMATION WITH?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, aside
              from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders or processing
              payment, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy or have privacy
              policies that protect your information unless you have "opted-in" to such sharing.
              If you have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version,
              you are still considered to have opted-in under this Privacy Statement. As stated,
              and whether or not you have opted-in, Blockdot may use third parties to accept and
              process orders for merchandise and products, including software, and such third
              parties may get access to your personal information for the purposes of providing
              services or products to you on Blockdot's behalf. In addition, if you Opt-Out, as
              discussed below, we may share that information with third parties who send emails
              on our behalf so that they do not email you.
          </p>
          <p>
              However, Blockdot may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law
              or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with
              the law or with legal process served on Blockdot; (2) protect and defend the rights
              or property of Blockdot; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.
          </p>
          <p>
              We may request demographic information from you (for example, your age, education
              level or household income) from time to time. We will not share that information
              in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other entity, unless we
              let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When we
              share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information
              only.

              If you provide us with your e-mail address, and do not opt-out of receiving e-mail
              from us, we may e-mail you with information from Blockdot, including information
              about selected third parties. If you do not want to receive information from Blockdot,
              you may decline to receive it (or "Opt-Out") either when you provide personal information
              to Blockdot or you may <a href="/login.aspx">sign in</a> and update your

              reflected in our systems; accordingly you might continue to receive emails from

              <b>WHAT ABOUT KIDS' PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              The Blockdot Sites are general audience sites and are not directed to children under
              the age of 13. Blockdot assumes products purchased through credit card means are
              purchased by adults. Blockdot respects the privacy of parents and children and is
              committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
              On those areas of the Sites that ask for age, Blockdot does not collect personal
              information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except
              in those limited circumstances where Blockdot believes that such collection is permitted
              under COPPA.
          </p>
          <p>
              If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to
              Blockdot, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. Blockdot
              will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under
              the age of 13. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain
              archived in web logs and back-up archives after Blockdot deletes the information
              from its active database (see the Web Logs paragraph above, and the Archived Information
              paragraph below).
          </p>
          <p>
              Blockdot believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities
              and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software
              manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can
              also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other
              personal information without parental permission.<br><br>
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT MY PRIVACY?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Security.</b> Blockdot has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse
              and alteration of the information under our control. These include a firewall to
              prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information
              in a separate database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure
              transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure
              or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and
              we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. We will protect the transmission
              of credit card information through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer)
              encryption.

          <p>
              <b>Chat Rooms and Other Public Areas.</b> Blockdot may offer chat, user reviews,
              multi-player games, bulletin board, or other public functions and any posting by
              you is considered public information available to other users. Any posting is governed
              by Blockdot's Terms of Service. You should take care to not use personal information
              in your screen name or other information that might be publicly available to other
              users.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Tell a Friend.</b> If a user elects to use our referral service for informing
              a friend about our site or particular features or content, we ask them for the friend's
              name and email address. Blockdot will automatically send the friend a one-time email
              inviting them to visit an Blockdot Site. Blockdot stores this information for the
              sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>

              Your personal information is password-protected, and you should take appropriate
              measures to protect the secrecy of your password. If you use a computer in a public
              place or share a computer with others, remember to sign out and close your browser
              window when you finish a session with Blockdot in order to prevent others from accessing
              your personal information.

              <b>Archived Information.</b> Blockdot maintains archives of its web logs, database,
              and other systems and information. Please note that it is possible some of this
              information may remain archived after Blockdot deletes the information from its
              active database (see the Web Logs paragraph above). Blockdot maintains archives
              for disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing purposes.

              You can help Blockdot maintain the accuracy of your profile by notifying us when
              you change your e-mail address or related information. If at any time you wish to
