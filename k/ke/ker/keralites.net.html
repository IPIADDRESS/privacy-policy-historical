			<b>Log Files<br>
			</b>As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log

			We also use third party advertisements on Keralites.net to support our site.

			Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP

			whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting
