		  <p align="center"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
		  <p>Thank  you for your interest in using the online information sharing service operated  by Gee Whiz Labs, Inc. Your privacy is important to us and we have prepared  this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share information  we obtain through your use of http://www.keepandshare.com  and its associated Facebook application 'Mimeo' (the “<strong>Site</strong>”). This Privacy Policy does not  govern our use of any information you provide to us when you call us, write to  us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through the Site. Because  the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you  submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including  the United States)  other than the one in which you reside. <strong>By  using the Site, you explicitly consent to such use of your information and  agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</strong> This Privacy Policy is effective  as of May 4, 2007.<strong></strong></p>
		  <p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information  We Automatically Collect. &nbsp;</strong>We automatically collect certain information to help  us understand how our users use the Site (which we will refer to in this  Privacy Policy collectively as “<strong>Usage  Data</strong>”). For example, each time you visit the Site we may automatically  collect your IP address, browser and computer type, access time, the Web page  from which you came, and the Web page(s) that you access during your visit. We  also use cookies (which are small amounts of data sent from a web server to  your browser that are stored on your computer’s hard drive) to keep track of  your use of the Site, to validate your identity, to remember your password and  preferences, to tailor the Site to meet your personal interests, and to improve  the quality of the Site. In addition, third parties who place advertisements on  the Site may also collect information through cookies to ensure that their  advertising systems and technologies work properly and to allow them to track  responses to their advertisements. Cookies set by these third parties are  governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. Generally, you can set  your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you if you are sent a cookie,  giving you the opportunity to choose whether or not to accept the cookie.  Please note that if you do set your browser not to accept cookies, certain  areas of our Site may not function properly.</p>
		  <p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information  You Choose To Submit.</strong> &nbsp;You can visit the Site without telling us who  you are or revealing any information by which someone could personally identify  you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as “<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). If, however,  you wish to register to become a member of the Site, you are required to  provide certain Personal Information (e.g., your name and e-mail address), and  we ask that you also provide a user name and password. We use your Personal  Information to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our  services, and to contact you from time to time about us, our Site, and our  products and services. You may also choose to submit additional information  about yourself (for example your gender, birth date, or zip code) by which  someone could not personally identify you (which we will refer to in this  Privacy Policy collectively as “<strong>Non-Personal  Information</strong>”). Finally, you may choose to submit documents, photos,  information about your calendar, or any other information that you would like  to share with other users of the Site (which we will refer to in this Privacy  Policy collectively as “<strong>Shared Information</strong>”).</p>
		  <p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Information Sharing Practices</strong></p>
		  <p><strong></strong><strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Generally.</em></strong> &nbsp;Except as  otherwise described in this section of our Privacy Policy, we will never share  your Usage Data, Personal Information, Non-Personal Information, or Shared  Information (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as “<strong>User Information</strong>”) with any third party  without your permission.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Advertisers.</em></strong> &nbsp;From time to time, we may share your Usage  Data and Non-Personal Information to enable third parties who serve  advertisements on the Site to deliver advertisements that will be relevant to  you. We will not share any such information, however, in a manner that would  enable the advertiser to personally identify you.</p>
		  <p><strong></strong><strong>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Aggregated Data.</em></strong> &nbsp;From time to  time, we may share aggregated User Information (other than Shared Information) with  third parties. We will not share any aggregated data, however, in manner that  would enable the recipient to personally identify you.</p>
		  <p><strong></strong><strong>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Service Providers.</em></strong> &nbsp;From time to  time, we may enter into relationships with third parties who provide services  to us (e.g., data management and storage services or credit card processing  services). In those circumstances, we disclose User Information that is  necessary for such service providers to perform those services and require that  they maintain the confidentiality of such User Information.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(e)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Friends.</em></strong>&nbsp; The Site enables you to designate individuals  with whom you would like us to share your User Information (which we will refer  to in this Privacy Policy collectively as “<strong>Friends</strong>”).  We may share your User Information with your Friends, however we will implement  the settings you select with respect to how such information is shared (e.g.,  providing access, but not editing rights, to documents). In no event, however,  will we share any of your User Information that you identify as private. Also,  so that other users of the Site can elect to designate you as one of their  Friends, certain User Information that you submit will be available to all  other users of the Site. The Site pages through which you submit User  Information will identify which information will be available to all other  users of the Site.<strong></strong></p>
		  <p><strong></strong><strong>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Other Disclosure Scenarios.</em></strong> &nbsp;Notwithstanding  anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right, and you  hereby expressly authorize us, to share any User Information: (1)&nbsp;in  response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish,  protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;  (2)&nbsp;if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or  take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving  potential threats to the safety of any person or property; (3)&nbsp;if we  believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding  significant abuse of the Site’s infrastructure or the Internet in general (such  as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise  the security of information); (4)&nbsp;to our parent company, subsidiaries,  joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case  we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy); and (5)&nbsp;if we  are acquired by or merged with another entity.</p>
		  <p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public Information.</strong> &nbsp;If you  identify any User Information as public, you are authorizing us to share such  information publicly. For example, you may elect to make certain Shared  Information (such as a calendar or photographs) publicly available. Also, there  may be areas of the Site (e.g., message boards, discussion rooms, and other  online forums) in which you are able to post information that will be available  to all other users of the Site. By choosing to use these areas, you understand  and agree that anyone may access, use, and disclose any information that you  post to those areas.</p>
		  <p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choice/Opt-Out.</strong> &nbsp;We offer you  the opportunity to choose not to receive communications from us. If you would  like to take advantage of this opportunity, please let us know by accessing and  updating your profile. Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to  ten business days to process and that we are not responsible for removing information  about you from the database of any third party to whom we were authorized to  disclose your User Information prior to processing your request. Even if you do  take advantage of this opportunity, we reserve the right to send you  administrative messages relating to the Site (e.g., about changes to this  Privacy Policy) and to contact you regarding any goods or services you have  ordered.</p>
		  <p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modifying and Deleting Your Personal  Information.</strong> &nbsp;If you would like to modify or delete from our  database any User Information you previously submitted to us, please let us  know by accessing and updating your profile. Please note that any User  Information that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period  of time after your request, and that if you delete certain information you may  not be able to order services in the future without re-submitting such  information. Also, please note that we will maintain User Information in our  database whenever we are required to do so by law.<strong></strong></p>
		  <p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security.</strong> &nbsp;We have implemented  reasonable measures to help protect your User Information from loss, misuse, or  unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission  over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we  strive to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its security.</p>
		  <p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Links.</strong> &nbsp;The Site may  contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy  practices of any such other website and urge you to review such practices prior  to submitting any information to such websites.</p>
		  <p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children’s Privacy.</strong>&nbsp; We are committed  to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and  guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and  interests. The Site is not intended for and may not be used by children under  the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the  age of 13 and we do not target the Site to children under the age of 13.<strong></strong></p>
		  <p><strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes. &nbsp;</strong>We  may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If under any such update we  make any material change to the way in which we treat your User Information, we  will inform you of such change via e‑mail or by posting a notice on relevant  areas of the Site. Any updated version of this Privacy Policy will be effective  as of the date set forth therein.</p>
		  <p><strong>Questions.</strong> &nbsp;If you have  any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us by e‑mail  at <a href="mailto:privacy@keepandshare.com">privacy@keepandshare.com</a>.</p>
