<p align="center"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in using the KeepandShare online information sharing service  operated by Gee Whiz Labs, Inc. Your privacy is important to us and we have  prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share  information we obtain through your use of http://www.keepandshare.com (the "<b>Site</b>"). This Privacy  Policy does not govern our use of any information you provide to us when you  call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through  the Site. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we collect  or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries  (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. <b>By using the Site, you explicitly  consent to such use of your information and agree to the terms of this Privacy  Policy.</b> This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 1, 2010. </p>

<p>Gee Whiz Labs, Inc. has been  awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices  have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TRUSTe's  program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and  use of your personal information.

<p><b>1.&nbsp;Information We  Automatically Collect. &nbsp;</b>We automatically collect certain  information to help us understand how our users use the Site (which we will refer  to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "<b>Usage Data</b>"). For example, each time you visit the  Site we may automatically collect your IP address, browser and computer type,  access time, the Web page from which you came, and the Web page(s) that you  access during your visit. We also use cookies (which are small amounts of data  sent from a web server to your browser that are stored on your computer’s hard  drive) to keep track of your use of the Site, to validate your identity, to  remember your password and preferences, to tailor the Site to meet your  personal interests, and to improve the quality of the Site. In addition, third  parties who place advertisements on the Site may also collect information  through cookies to ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work  properly and to allow them to track responses to their advertisements. Cookies  set by these third parties are governed by the privacy policies of those third  parties. Generally, you can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify  you if you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to choose whether or  not to accept the cookie. Please note that if you do set your browser not to  accept cookies, certain areas of our Site may not function properly.</p>

<p><b>Clear Gifs  (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</b>.  Our third party advertising partner  employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs),  that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is  effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny  graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used  to track the online movements of Web users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s  computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are  about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the  information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable  information. </p>


<p><b>Flash LSOs</b>. We use local shared objects, also known as  Flash cookies, to play training tutorial videos on our site.&nbsp; In addition,  Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or  to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies  to collect and store information.</p>
<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies  because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.&nbsp; Cookie  management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.&nbsp;  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">click  here</a>.</p> 

<p><b>2.&nbsp;Information  You Choose To Submit.</b> &nbsp;You can visit the Site without  telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could  personally identify you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy  collectively as "<b>Personal  Information</b>"). If, however, you wish to register to become a  member of the Site, you are required to provide certain Personal Information  (e.g., your name and e-mail address), and we ask that you also provide a user  name and password. We use your Personal Information to fulfill your requests  for products and services, to improve our services, and to contact you from  time to time about us, our Site, and our products and services, and  newsletters. You may also choose to submit additional information about  yourself (for example your gender, or zip code) by which someone could not personally  identify you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "<b>Non-Personal Information</b>").  Finally, you may choose to submit documents, photos, calendar entries, or any  other information that you would like to share with other users of the Site  (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "<b>Shared Information</b>").&nbsp; You may at any time decide who is able  to review your Shared Information.&nbsp;  You may control the exact sharing of any of your Shared Information by  changing the sharing settings for that particular item or its enclosing folder. </p>

<p>We provide you the ability to import photos from third party sites.&nbsp; If you choose to import your photos  from third party sites we will ask you for your username and password for that  site in order to allow you to sign into your account and import your  photos.&nbsp; We do not store this  information for any reason. No other information will be imported when we  import your photos. </p>



<p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our  Information Sharing Practices. </b></p>
<p><b>(a) <em> Generally.</em></b> &nbsp;Except as otherwise described in this section of our Privacy Policy, we  will never sell, share, rent, or trade your Usage Data, Personal Information,  Non-Personal Information, or Shared Information (which we will refer to in this  Privacy Policy collectively as "<b>User Information</b>") with any third party except as  disclosed within this privacy policy.</p>

<p><b>(b)&nbsp;</b><em><b>Advertisers.</b></em> &nbsp;From time to time, we may share your Usage Data and Non-Personal  Information to enable third parties who serve advertisements on the Site to  deliver advertisements that will be relevant to you. We will not share any such  information, however, in a manner that would enable the advertiser to  personally identify you.</p>

<p><b>(c)&nbsp;</b><em><b>Aggregated  Data.</b></em> &nbsp;From time to time, we may share aggregated User  Information (other than Shared Information) with third parties. We will not  share any aggregated data, however, in manner that would enable the recipient  to personally identify you.</p>

<p><b>(d)&nbsp;</b><em><b>Service  Providers.</b></em> &nbsp;From time to time, we may enter into relationships  with third parties who provide services to us (e.g., data management and  storage services or credit card processing services). In those circumstances,  we disclose User Information that is necessary for such service providers to  perform those services and require that they maintain the confidentiality of  such User Information.</p>

<p><b>(e)</b>&nbsp;<em><b>Friends.</b></em>&nbsp;  The Site enables you to designate individuals with whom you would like us to  share your User Information (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy  collectively as "<b>Friends</b>").  We may share your User Information with your Friends, however we will implement  the settings you select with respect to how such information is shared (e.g.,  providing access, but not editing rights, to documents). In no event, however,  will we share any of your User Information that you identify as private. Also,  so that other users of the Site can elect to designate you as one of their  Friends, certain User Information that you submit will be available to all  other users of the Site. The Site pages through which you submit User  Information will identify which information will be available to all other  users of the Site.</p>

<p><b>(f)&nbsp;</b><em><b>Other  Disclosure Scenarios.</b></em> &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy  Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize  us, to share any User Information: (1)&nbsp;in response to subpoenas, court  orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal  rights or defend against legal claims; (2)&nbsp;if we believe it is necessary  in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,  fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or  property; (3)&nbsp;if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or  take action regarding significant abuse of the Site’s infrastructure or the  Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or  attempts to compromise the security of information); (4)&nbsp;to our parent  company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control  with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy  Policy); and (5)&nbsp;if we are acquired by or merged with another entity.</p>

<p><b>4.&nbsp;Public  Information.</b> &nbsp;If you identify any User Information as public, you  are authorizing us to share such information publicly. For example, you may  elect to make certain Shared Information (such as a calendar or photographs)  publicly available. Also, there may be areas of the Site (e.g., message boards,  discussion rooms, and blogs) in which you are able to post information that  will be available to all other users of the Site. By choosing to use these  areas, you understand and agree that anyone may access, use, and disclose any  information that you post to those areas. If you use these areas of the site  you should be aware that any information you submit there can be read,  collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send  you unsolicited messages.&nbsp; We are  not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to  submit in these forums.</p>

<p><b>Customer Testimonials</b>.  We post customer testimonials on  our web site which may contain personally identifiable information.&nbsp; If a testimonial does contain  personally identifiable information, we obtain the customer's consent via email  prior to posting the testimonial.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>5.&nbsp;Choice/Opt-Out.</b> &nbsp;We offer you the opportunity to choose not to receive communications from  us. If you would like to take advantage of this opportunity, please let us know  by accessing and updating your account settings. You may opt-out from receiving  marketing or newsletter communications at anytime by clicking on the  unsubscribe link located within each email communication. Please note that  sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process. Even if  you do take advantage of this opportunity, we reserve the right to send you  administrative messages relating to the Site (e.g., about changes to this  Privacy Policy) and to contact you regarding any goods or services you have  ordered.</p>

<p><b>6.&nbsp;Modifying and  Deleting Your Personal Information.</b> &nbsp;If you would like to  modify or delete from our database any User Information you previously  submitted to us, please let us know by accessing and updating your profile in  your account settings. Please note that any User Information that we have  copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your  request, and that if you delete certain information you may not be able to  order services in the future without re-submitting such information. Also,  please note that we will maintain User Information in our database whenever we  are required to do so by law.</p>

<p><b>7.&nbsp;Security.</b> &nbsp;The security of your personal information is  important to us.&nbsp; When you enter  sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order  forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology  (SSL).&nbsp; </p>

<p>We have implemented reasonable measures to help protect your User  Information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure.  Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be  guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User  Information, we cannot guarantee its security.</p>

<p><b>8.&nbsp;Links.</b> &nbsp;The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for  the privacy practices of any such other website and urge you to review such  practices prior to submitting any information to such websites.</p>

<p><b>9.&nbsp;Children’s  Privacy.</b>&nbsp; We are committed to protecting the privacy needs  of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in  their children’s online activities and interests. The Site is not intended for  and may not be used by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly  collect information from children under the age of 13 and we do not target the  Site to children under the age of 13.</p>

<p><b>10.&nbsp;Changes.  &nbsp;</b>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If  under any such update we make any material change to the way in which we treat  your User Information, we will inform you of such change via e-mail or by  posting a notice on relevant areas of the Site. Any updated version of this  Privacy Policy will be effective as of the date set forth therein.</p>

<p><b>11. Third Party Information</b></p>
<p><b>Invite-A-Friend</b>. If you  choose to use our 'Invite a Friend' referral service, we will ask you for your  friend’s email address.&nbsp; We will  automatically create your friend a free KeepandShare account to use to sign in  and use to view your shared information, and we will send your friend a  one-time welcome email inviting him or her to visit the site and use their free  account.&nbsp; Gee Whiz Labs stores this  information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and giving your  friend access to their KeepandShare account. Your friend may follow the  instructions in the welcome email to close their account or instruct  KeepandShare to not send them any further emails.</p>

<p><b>Address Application</b>. We allow you to add your friends and families addresses and names to your  account so that you may reference them at any time.&nbsp; You also have the ability to import your contacts as  well.&nbsp; We do not store your email  address or password of any other address book that you may use to import your  contacts, we will not use your contacts for any reason other than to store them  for you. If you wish to delete your friends or families addresses or other  personal information you may do so by using the ‘delete’ command on an Address. <br>
  If you send an email to a third party recipient, you have the ability to  save the email address that you used to send this third party an email.&nbsp; We do not use this email address for  any reason other then to send the emails to them that you requested we sent. If  you wish to delete this email address from your account you may do so at any  time by accessing your account settings screen. </p>
