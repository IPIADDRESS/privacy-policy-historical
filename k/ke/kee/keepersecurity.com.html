			</p><h1>
  			KEEPER® MOBILE &amp; DESKTOP SECURITY SOFTWARE<br>
  			PRIVACY AND EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS POLICY
			</h1>
			<br>
			<h2>General</h2>
			Keeper Security, Inc. (“Keeper Security”) values your
			privacy. Keeper Security has created this Privacy Policy to
			demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy and to disclose
			our information and privacy practices for https://keepersecurity.com
			and its services. We reserve the right to change this Policy and will
			notify you of such changes via email or our website. If you have
			questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you may contact
			us at support@keepersecurity.com. <br>
			<br>
			<h2>Security</h2>
			Keeper Security stores its servers in a highly secure server
			environment with 24 X 7 monitoring, surveillance and support to
			prevent unauthorized access and data security. Advanced security
			measures including firewalls, security guards and surveillance are
			taken to ensure the continued service and protection of your data
			from natural disaster, intruders and disruptive events. <br>
			<br> Smartphones and Tablets are unsecure from a security
			perspective. With typically unsecure or weak logic access to data in
			the calendar, contact list, email database and notes - they represent
			a massive flaw in many internal security and control systems. When a
			user’s Smartphone or Tablet is lost or stolen, the data on that
			device is subject to theft and misappropriation. The result can be
			devastating in terms of risk exposure and financial loss. <br>
			<br> Keeper software serves a massive, positive movement in Mobile
			Device Security. Keeper was pioneered to run on the widest platform
			base using a feature-rich mobile security application. Keeper runs on
			iPhone*, iPad*, iPod*, Android*, Android Tablets*, BlackBerry*,
			Windows Mobile* and all primary PC platforms - Windows*, Mac OS* and
			Linux*. Keeper uses a proprietary encryption method using 128-bit AES
			cipher which operates throughout the storage and data stream when
			posting and retrieving end user data from the Cloud Security Vault.
			(*Note: These trade names are protected by the registered trademarks
			of their respective owners. Keeper and Password Keeper are U.S.
			registered trademarks of Keeper Security, Inc.). <br>
			<br> Keeper protects “Micro Data.” Micro Data consists
			of small strings of information, usually 50 characters or less, used
			by every consumer of a Smartphone, Tablet or PC. Examples include:
			Social Security Numbers, Bank Account and Routing Information, Client
			Account Numbers, Vendor Account Numbers, Customer Purchasing
			Information, Credit Limit Terms, Log In Passwords, Encryption Codes,
			Alarm Codes, Access Codes, Employee ID Numbers, etc. Micro Data is
			the small strings of information that although small, represent the
			most important element of an end user’s identity. Micro Data is
			the target for any thief, spy or hacker. Too often, Micro Data is
			kept by professionals and end users in sticky notes, paper notebooks,
			envelopes, file folders and email note tabs on mobile devices and
			computers. More often than not, they are easily accessible by an
			unwanted user and are the primary target for today’s identity
			and financial thieves. By example, from a corporate risk perspective,
			an employee’s mobile device may have a cost value of $195 but
			the information on that device may be worth several million dollars.
			<br>
			<br> Keeper is one of the most downloaded password security
			applications for storing, accessing and safeguarding Micro Data. <br>
			<br>
			<h2>U.S. Government Approval &amp; Encryption Level</h2>
			Keeper utilizes strong encryption using the 128-bit AES cipher.
			Keeper is approved for export to unrestricted countries* by the U.S.
			Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security under
			classification #5D992 (*See <a href="/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>).
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
			Keeper Security collects limited personal information from customers who register with our services.  When customers register with our services, we require a user name, password, and email address.  We use the customer registration information to authenticate users and provide access to https://keepersecurity.com.  We also use the email addresses used in the registration information to communicate with our users.  When you register for a subscription to Keeper software, you automatically "opt-in" to receive email communication from us which shall concur with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.  From time to time, Keeper Security may contact you via email to notify you of changes to its services, maintenance notifications, information about Keeper Security and promotional materials from Keeper Security.  You will be permitted at any time to "opt-out" of the receipt of email communications related to marketing and promotional material.  The "opt-out" page can be viewed here: https://keepersecurity.com/unsubscribe.  In the event you opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional material, we may, as necessary, email you in connection with a purchase confirmation, customer support matter or security issue related to your account.  Keeper Security will never have access to your Master Password or individual records stored within your Keeper database.  For users of Keeper Backup or Keeper Enterprise, we only have access to an encrypted binary file (which we cannot open) on our Cloud Security Vault™.  This allows us to help you in the event your device is lost, damaged or stolen or if you have a problem accessing your personal data file. 
			<br><br> Keeper Security collects and logs aggregate user statistics
			and website traffic. Such information includes website traffic
			statistics, date and time of visits, browser type used to access the
			service, frequency of visits and to which pages, etc. We use this
			information to improve the services delivered to our customers, to
			track and diagnose performance problems and administer the website. <br>
			<br> Keeper Security may disclose aggregated user statistics (for
			example, 50% of Keeper Security customers use the service daily) in
			order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers,
			affiliates and other third parties for lawful purposes. Keeper
			Security will never disclose such data on an individual or
			identifiable basis to third parties except when we must comply with
			laws that require such disclosure to law enforcement authorities or
			other government third party officials such as subpoenas. <br>
			<br> You may deactivate your Keeper Security account and delete
			your personally identifiable information at any time by contacting us
			at support@keepersecurity.com clearly indicating that you wish to
			deactivate and delete such information. <br>
			<br> In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy
			Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) Keeper Security does not intentionally
			collect personally identifiable information from nor solicit children
			under the age of thirteen (13) years of age. <br>
			<br> Other than as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, at no time
			will Keeper Security disclose identifiable personal information to
			any third parties without your express, written consent. <br>
			<br> Keeper Security will be permitted to display an active
			customer's corporate logo on its website for the purpose of promoting
			both the customer and Keeper Security. <br>
			<br>
			<h2>Cookies</h2>
			Keeper Security uses cookies to store and track information about
			your usage of our services. Cookies are encrypted and unidentifiable
			bits of information sent to your browser from a web server that is
			stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are set each time you
			register, or log in or log out of Keeper Security. Cookies may be
			used to store your username and password so that you don't have to
			re-enter it each time you visit http://keepersecurity.com. We may
			also use cookies to gather aggregated information about user habits
			on our website and services. For example, we may use cookies to
			estimate the number of concurrent users, estimate the total number of
			users, measure traffic statistics and to better understand how our
			users are using our services. We may share this data, in its
			aggregate form, with advertisers, affiliates and partners who may
			advertise on our website and services. <br>
			<br>
			<h2>Passwords</h2>
			Your Keeper Security account information, user name, password and
			customer profile are password-protected so that you have secure
			access to entering and editing personal information. It is the user's
			responsibility to protect the security of their password. Access to
			Keeper Security services are protected by a unique user name and
			password that is known by you only. Keeper Security has designed
			internal security processes that encrypt customer passwords to
			protect it from being divulged or accessed by anyone other than you.
			Neither Keeper Security employees nor any of its contractors can
			obtain or access your password. Keeper Security employees or nor any
			of its contractors will ask you for your password via mail, email or
			telephone nor any other unsolicited manner. <br>
			<br>
			<h2>Third Party Links</h2>
			When customers and users access and use Keeper Security, there may be
			links to websites and services operated by third parties. Keeper
			Security makes no representations or warranties about the policies of
			third party websites that are linked to Keeper Security or any of its
			services. Keeper Security recommends that you read the privacy
			policies posted by those third party websites. <br>
