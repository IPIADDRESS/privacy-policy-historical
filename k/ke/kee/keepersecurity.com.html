Keeper Security is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework's applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield List.

Keeper Security complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.<br><br>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Keeper Security is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Keeper Security does not have access to or knowledge of an account holder’s master password, encryption keys or access to his or her Keeper vault. Accordingly, any account disclosure required by law, under a subpoena, would be limited to general account information such as the account holder’s name and account term.<br><br>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" target="_blank">https://feedback- form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.<br><br>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint</a>], you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p><h2>Security</h2><p>
Keeper Security stores its servers in a highly secure server environment with 24 X 7 monitoring, surveillance and support to prevent unauthorized access and data security. Advanced security measures including firewalls, security guards and surveillance are taken to ensure the continued service and protection of your data from natural disaster, intruders and disruptive events.</p><p>Smartphones and Tablets are insecure from a security perspective. With typically unsecure or weak logic access to data in the calendar, contact list, email database and notes - they represent a massive flaw in many internal security and control systems. When a user’s Smartphone or Tablet is lost or stolen, the data on that device is subject to theft and misappropriation. The result can be devastating in terms of risk exposure and financial loss.</p><p>
Keeper software serves a massive, positive movement in Mobile Device Security. Keeper was pioneered to run on the widest platform base using a feature-rich mobile security application. Keeper runs on iPhone*, iPad*, iPod*, Android*, Android Tablets*, Windows Phone* and all primary PC platforms - Windows*, Mac OS* and Linux*. Keeper uses 256-bit AES encryption and PBKDF2 key derivation.  Please refer to our <a href="https://keepersecurity.com/security.html">Security Disclosure</a> page for detailed information about our security and encryption practices.  (*Note: These trade names are protected by the registered trademarks of their respective owners. Keeper and Password Keeper are U.S. registered trademarks of Keeper Security, Inc.).</p><p>Keeper protects “Micro Data.” Micro Data consists of small strings of information, usually 50 characters or less, used by every consumer of a Smartphone, Tablet or PC. Examples include: Social Security Numbers, Bank Account and Routing Information, Client Account Numbers, Vendor Account Numbers, Customer Purchasing Information, Credit Limit Terms, Log In Passwords, Encryption Codes, Alarm Codes, Access Codes, Employee ID Numbers, etc. Micro Data is the small strings of information that although small, represent the most important element of an end user’s identity. Micro Data is the target for any thief, spy or cybercriminal. Too often, Micro Data is kept by professionals and end users in sticky notes, paper notebooks, envelopes, file folders and email note tabs on mobile devices and computers. More often than not, they are easily accessible by an unwanted user and are the primary target for today’s identity and financial thieves. By example, from a corporate risk perspective, an employee’s mobile device may have a cost value of $195 but the information on that device may be worth several million dollars.</p><p>
Keeper is one of the most downloaded password security applications for storing, accessing and safeguarding Micro Data.</p><h2>U.S. Government Approval &amp; Encryption Level</h2><p>Keeper utilizes strong encryption using the 256-bit AES cipher.

Security</h2><p>
Keeper Security stores its servers in a highly secure server environment with 24 X 7 monitoring, surveillance and support to prevent unauthorized access and data security. Advanced security measures including firewalls, security guards and surveillance are taken to ensure the continued service and protection of your data from natural disaster, intruders and disruptive events.
</p><p>
Smartphones and Tablets are insecure from a security perspective. With typically unsecure or weak logic access to data in the calendar, contact list, email database and notes - they represent a massive flaw in many internal security and control systems. When a user’s Smartphone or Tablet is lost or stolen, the data on that device is subject to theft and misappropriation. The result can be devastating in terms of risk exposure and financial loss.
</p><p>
Keeper software serves a massive, positive movement in Mobile Device Security. KeeperChat was pioneered to run on a wide platform base using a feature-rich mobile security application.
