Online Privacy Policy</p>
                                        
<p><b>(Last Updated: February 24, 2009)</b></p>
<p>  At KEEN, Inc. ("KEEN," "we," or "us"), we are committed to the privacy of our customers. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how personal information is collected from users of the KEEN website at <u>www.keenfootwear.com</u> (the "Site"), and how that information is used and disclosed. By using our Site, you consent to the terms of this Policy. </p>
<p> We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time and will notify you of such changes by posting the modified Policy on our Site and indicating at the top of the Policy the date it was last updated. If there are material changes to this Policy, we will notify you more directly.</p>
<p><span class="bold">PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span><br>
You provide personal information to us in a number of ways when you visit the Site.<br>
  For example, you provide us with personal information when you: </p>
<ul>
  <li>create or update an account or profile and subscribe to our e-mail newsletter or other services ("Services"); </li>
  <li>purchase KEEN products on the Site; </li>
  <li>participate in a survey, contest, sweepstakes, or other promotions on the Site; </li>
  <li>contact us by e-mail for any reason, such as to request help with the Services, or to provide us with your comments/feedback; </li>
  <li>submit personal information in connection with photos/stories for our potential use and/or publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may collect your name, image, billing and shipping addresses, e-mail address, phone number, credit card number and expiration date. We may also collect certain demographic information in connection with your participation in any survey, contest, sweepstakes, or promotion on the Site such as gender, birth day and month, city, state and country, websites and personal interests. </p>
<p>Additionally, when you visit our Site, some information is automatically collected, such as your computer's operating system and browser type, version, and capabilities (such as whether JavaScript is enabled and cookies are accepted), your Internet Protocol (IP) address and the time and date of your visit, the referring site (if applicable), as well as screen resolution, color and depth. This information is tracked through the use of web beacons, cookies and logs. </p>
<p><u>Cookies.</u> We may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies."  Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by your browser at the request of a Web site to store your personal preferences. Among other things, the use of cookies helps us to improve the Site and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing the Site, to personalize your experience, and to remember your preferences. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not be able to access certain features or services of the Site.</p>
<p><u>Web Beacons.</u> "Web beacons" (also known as "web bugs," "action tags," "pixel trackers," or "clear GIFs") may also be used on the Site or in our emails. Web beacons are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an e-mail message that allow the collection of certain information and monitor user activity on the Site or in emails. Web beacons are invisible because of their size (only 1 by 1 pixel) and because they are the same color as the background of the web page. Web beacons are used to collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web user comes from and the time the Web beacon is activated (such as when you view the webpage, advertisement, or e-mail that contains the Web beacon).</p>
<p><span class="bold">HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</span><br>
In general, we use personal information collected on the Site to provide the Services and otherwise process transactions on the Site, to provide support for the Services, to respond to user requests and inquiries, to maintain a record of our dealings with Site users, to develop and improve products and services, to inform users about products or services we think will be of interest and to allow users to connect or search for other customers that share similar interests. </p>
<p>When we use your personal information in our marketing efforts, we provide you with choices (see "Choice," below). We may also receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, and may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you (for example, we may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with billing for KEEN products). </p>
<p><span class="bold">SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION</span><br>
The HybridLife section of the Site is designed as an open and public social community for connecting and sharing with other people. When you sign up you will be asked to provide your email address and your name.  Your name will be displayed publicly along with photos, stories, posts, and other information you choose to provide in your profile including your city, state, country, birth day and month, gender, and your Web site, blog, and social networking URLS.  Certain data such as last name, birthday and gender can be provided to Keen without displaying to others by choosing settings of "Don't display." Except for first name, if there is other information you do not want displayed publicly, you may choose not to include it in your profile. <br>
  We may also post or publish your information when you submit comments, stories, photos, and videos in connection with surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions offered on the Site.</p>
<p>We do not share, sell, trade, or rent personal information to third parties, including for their own marketing purposes without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy. We may share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in operating our business. These functions may include, for example, analyzing traffic information or other data, providing marketing assistance to us, mailing items, processing credit card transactions, and fulfilling or delivering orders. In all cases, we limit the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which is necessary to carry out those functions. </p>
<p>We also disclose personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a subpoena, warrant or court order) or respond to lawful requests and legal process; to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect the rights and property of Keen, our agents, our community members, our customers' and others; to protect our community members, customers and others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of  the Site or Services; or if we reasonably believe that disclosure is needed to respond to an emergency or protect the personal safety of any person. </p>
<p>In addition, information about our customers, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.</p>

 We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's use of the Internet. The Site is not designed to collect personal information from children who are under 13 years of age, and we do not intend to or knowingly collect such information. If you are under 13, you should not provide personal information on our Site. </p>
<p><span class="bold">SECURITY</span><br>
