<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="000066"><b>Community Standards: Keen.com Privacy Policy</b></font></p>
<p>Keen.com, Inc. takes privacy issues very seriously and we have made a firm 
  commitment to protect your privacy. The following outlines Keen.com's policies 
  for information gathering and dissemination.</p>
  <font face="arial" size="2"> 
  <p><font size="3" color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TRUSTe 
    Licensee</b></font><br>
    <a href="https://www.truste.org/validate/5518"><img src="http://a548.g.akamai.net/7/548/163/9109a34da35ab4/img.keen.com/web/Assets/images/truste/ClickSeal.gif" align="right" height="73" width="91" border="0" alt="TRUSTe: Click to Verify" hspace="5"></a>This 
    confirms that Keen.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe 
    is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' 
    trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information 
    practices. Because Keen.com wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, 
    it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices 
    reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this 
    web site has agreed to notify you of: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally 
      identification is collected from you through the web site </li>
    <li> The organization collecting the information</li>
    <li>How the information is used</li>
    <li>With whom the information may be shared</li>
    <li> What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution 
      of the information</li>
    <li> The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, 
      misuse or alteration of information under Keen.com's control</li>
    <li> How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first 
    contact Keen.com, Inc. by sending email to <a href="mailto:privacy@keen.com">privacy@keen.com</a>. 
    If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not 
    been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html">http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html</a>. 
    TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.</p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Information 
    Keen.com Collects</b></font><br>
    Registration is not required in order to browse the Keen.com web site, <a href="http://www.keen.com">www.keen.com</a> 
    ("the Site"), but it is required to connect with other members of the Keen.com 
    community via telephone or Keen Mail. When members join Keen.com we collect 
    contact information including full name, email address and telephone number. 
    We use members' email addresses to contact them regarding administrative notices, 
    new site features, and communications relevant to their use of the Site. Members 
    can stop receiving site updates and promotional mailings from Keen.com by 
    sending their member name and email address to <a href="mailto:mailopt-out@keen.com">mailopt-out@keen.com</a> 
    or by unchecking the box on the Personal Info page which asks whether they 
    wish to receive such mailings. </p>
  <p>If members choose to include their personal information in the Keen.com search 
    feature, we use their names and email addresses to help others search for 
    listings that those members have created. For example, if a person knows that 
    a friend is a member of Keen.com, but doesn't know the friend's member name, 
    that person can search for any listings that the friend has created by typing 
    in the friend's first name, last name, or email address in the search field. 
    Keen.com will never disclose member names or email addresses during the search 
    process, and members can remove themselves from the search feature by clicking 
    on the Personal Info tab at the My Account page.</p>
  <p>We collect additional information such as a mailing address and social security 
    numbers and/or Federal Tax ID numbers from members who charge price per minute 
    fees above the standard rate to communicate with them through the Keen.com 
    web site. Members who are not United States taxpayers, will not be asked for 
    their social security numbers or Federal Tax ID numbers, though they may need 
    to report income to their local tax authority. We use members' mailing addresses 
    to remit payments according to our payment policy set out in our Member Agreement. 
    We use members' social security numbers and/or Federal Tax ID numbers to prepare 
    Form 1099s for members who earn more than $600 in a calendar year. Keen.com 
    will not use this information for any purpose other than to prepare Form 1099s 
    and will never share this information with third parties.</p>
  <p>Keen.com requires members to select a unique member name and password during 
    the member sign-up process. Member names are used throughout the site to identify 
    members to other Keen.com users. Therefore, members should be aware that if 
    they use their real name as their member name, this information will be visible 
    to others on the site, who will then be able to personally identify their 
    activities on the site.</p>
  <p>Keen.com collects credit card information from members when they add money 
    to their Keen.com accounts. We use credit card information to bill members 
    for telephone calls that they initiate. Keen.com uses a third party to process 
    credit cards for billing purposes. This third party does not store or retain 
    any of a member's personally identifiable information. We also use credit 
    card information to verify age in order to provide members access to certain 
    areas of the site. Members will not be allowed access to these areas unless 
    they provide a valid credit card number. The age verification process will 
    NOT result in a charge to a member's credit card or in the credit card being 
    used for billing purposes.</p>
  <p>Members may also provide additional profile information (such as experience, 
    credentials, affiliations, on-call schedule, etc.) that is displayed publicly 
    on the Site. Other than the profile information submitted by members, Keen.com 
    does not disclose any personally identifying information without members' 
    permission.</p>
  <p>Keen.com collects information from potential affiliates including the company's 
    name, address and URL, and the names, addresses, e-mail addresses and telephone 
    numbers of the company's primary contacts. We use this information to contact 
    affiliates regarding administrative notices, new site features, and communications 
    relevant to their use of the Site. Keen.com also collects affiliates' social 
    security numbers and/or Federal Tax ID numbers. This information is required 
    so that Keen.com may prepare Form 1099s for those affiliates who earn money 
    through the Keen.com affiliate program. Keen.com does not disclose any personally 
    identifying information, without an affiliate's permission.</p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Member-to-Member 
    Communications</b></font><br>
    <font color="#000066"><b>Telephone Communications</b></font><br>
    Because our business connects members by telephone, Keen.com requires valid 
    telephone numbers from all of its members. We use telephone numbers to connect 
    members through the Site. <b>At no time will Keen.com share members' telephone 
    numbers with anyone, including those members with whom they communicate through 
    the Keen.com Site.</b> Because Keen.com initiates all telephone calls made 
    through the Site, neither party can see the other's telephone number - not 
    even with Caller ID. Although the Keen.com system maintains the connection 
    between the two parties, telephone calls between members are not monitored.</p>
  <p><font color="#000066"><b>Keen Mail</b></font><br>
    Keen.com also facilitates communication among members through our on-site 
    Keen Mail system. Messages sent via Keen Mail are identified only by member 
    name, and do not reveal either member's e-mail address.</p>
  <p><font color="#000066"><b>Feedback Ratings</b></font><br>
    Members are given the opportunity to rate and provide feedback regarding fellow 
    members, both in numerical and textual form. These feedback ratings are viewable 
    on the Site. All numerical feedback will contribute to a member's overall 
    rating. Textual comments will be attributed to the rating member's member 
    name. Once posted members cannot change or remove any ratings or textual messages.</p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Other 
    Information</b></font><br>
    <font color="#000066"><b>Aggregate Information</b></font> Keen.com may use 
    certain information collected from members in aggregate form to tailor our 
    members' experience at the Site, showing them content that we think they might 
    be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 
    We may also use this information to improve our marketing and promotional 
    efforts.</p>
  <p><font color="#000066"><b>IP Addresses</b></font> Keen.com uses User IP addresses 
    to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Generally, 
    IP addresses tell us the location from which a User is connecting to us, what 
    service provider the User is using, and which parts of the Site the User is 
    visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. 
    This means that a User's session will be tracked, but the User will remain 
    anonymous.</p>
  <p><font color="#000066"><b>Correspondence</b></font> If a member sends Keen.com 
    e-mail correspondence, or if other members or other third parties send us 
    e-mail or other correspondence regarding a particular member's activities 
    or postings on the Site, Keen.com may collect such information in that member's 
    account file.</p>
  <p><font color="#000066"><b>Keen.com Affiliates</b></font> Keen.com may disclose 
    aggregate data and statistics in order to describe the Site and services to 
    prospective partners, cobranded sites, advertisers and other third parties, 
    and for other lawful purposes. <b>We do not sell, rent, or trade any personally 
    identifiable information to third parties, and we do not use members' mailing 
    address information for unsolicited marketing.</b> The only exceptions are 
    when we either have a member's permission or believe in good faith that the 
    law requires it. Keen.com may disclose some personally identifiable information 
    to third party service providers in connection with communications and payments 
    to users and other aspects of operation of the site. Such third parties will 
    be under extensive confidentiality restrictions. </p>
  <p><font color="#000066"><b>Promotions</b></font> Keen.com may from time to 
    time run online promotions in which we ask visitors for demographic information 
    (like their zip code, state/province or age). Keen.com may also run contests 
    on the Site in which we ask visitors for demographic information. We use this 
    data to tailor our visitor's experience at the Site, showing them content 
    that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according 
    to their preferences. We also use demographic information to determine eligibility 
    for certain contests.</p>
  <p><font color="#000066"><b>Surveys</b></font> From time to time Keen.com may 
    ask members to participate in online surveys. Such surveys may ask visitors 
    for contact information (like their email address). We use contact data from 
    our surveys to send the user information about our company. Users may opt-out 
    of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.</p>
  <p><font color="#000066"><b>Tell A Friend Program</b></font> Keen.com's Tell 
    A Friend Program allows members to earn money by referring their friends to 
    our Site. The contact information entered as part of Keen.com's Tell A Friend 
    program will be used only to personalize referral e-mail sent to the member's 
    friends. The information entered about various friends will be used to send 
    a one-time referral e-mail to the friends.</p>
  <p><font color="#000066"><b>Verification Program</b></font> In order to enhance 
    their listings, members may <a href="https://www.keen.com/web/credentials_redirect.asp">verify</a> 
    their professional and academic credentials through Backgrounds Online, a 
    leading provider of comprehensive background checks on individuals. Members 
    may submit information to be verified by <a href="http://www.backgroundsonline.com/" target="_blank">Backgrounds 
    Online</a> (such as academic degrees and professional licenses) on the Keen.com 
    web site. All information submitted as part of the verification program is 
    subject to the <a href="https://www.keen.com/web/credentials_redirect.asp">agreement</a> 
    between the member and Backgrounds Online, which may contain terms that differ 
    from Keen.com's privacy policy.</p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Links 
    to Other Sites</b></font><br>
    The Site may contain links to other sites. Keen.com is not responsible for 
    the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage members 
    to review the policies of these sites before revealing any sensitive or personal 
    information in the course of using these other sites.</p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Keen.com's 
    Use of Cookies</b></font><br>
    The Site uses cookies. Cookies are small amounts of data sent to a user's 
    browser from the Keen.com Web servers and stored on a user's computer's hard 
    drive. Keen.com uses cookies to track the pages on the Site that our users 
    have visited. This allows us to collect aggregate information about usage 
    on the Site. Keen.com may also use cookies to deliver content specific to 
    members' interests, and to keep track of members' member names and passwords 
    so that members do not have to reenter them during a session. Users who choose 
    not to accept cookies are unable to use the Keen.com web site.</p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Reviewing 
    and Changing Personally Identifiable Information</b></font><br>
    Once members join Keen.com they can review and change much of their personally 
    identifiable information - including name, e-mail address, telephone number, 
    password and password reminder -- by clicking on the Personal Info tab at 
    the My Account page on the Keen.com Site. Members may review, update or change 
    their address and credit card information -- if they have supplied it -- by 
    clicking on the Credit Card Information link at the My Account page. Members 
    also may correct, update or delete any of their Keen.com listings by clicking

  <p>We will retain in our files information members have requested to remove 
    in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems 
    and enforce our Member Agreement. Moreover, such information is never completely 
    removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact we back 
    up our systems. Therefore, members' personally identifiable information may 
    not be completely removed from our databases in response to member requests.</p>
