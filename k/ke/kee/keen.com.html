      <p class="body">Your privacy is very important to us at Keen, 
        and Keen is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. 
        What is TRUSTe? TRUSTe is a non-profit organization dedicated to building 
        trust in the Internet. We disclose information practices to TRUSTe, who 
        in turn operates as third-party "watch dog" by auditing our 
        privacy practices to make sure that we are in compliance with TRUSTe's 
        privacy standards. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, 
        you can expect to be notified of: What personally identifiable information 
        of yours is collected; What organization is collecting the information; 
        How the information is used; With whom the information may be shared; 
        What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution 
        of the information; What kind of security procedures are in place to protect 
        the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control; 
        and How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.<span class="body"> 
        </span></p>
      <p class="body">If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, 
        you should first contact Keen, Inc. by sending email 
        to <a href="mailto:privacy@keen.com">privacy@keen.com</a>. If you do not 
        receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily 
        addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html">http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html</a>. 
        TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Keen to resolve 
        your concerns. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect 
        about you and what may happen to that information. Although this policy 
        may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you 
        should know as much as possible about Keen's practices 
        so that you can make an informed decision.<br>

        <span class="body">Children are not eligible to use Keen 
        and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal 
        information to us.</span></p>
      <p class="body"><span class="subhead"><a name="security"></a>2. Security</span><br>
        Keen has security measures in place to protect the loss, 
        misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We use Secure 
        Socket Layer (SSL), which digitally encrypts your information, as it is 
        transferred from your computer to Keen. We have taken 
        measures to protect user information once it is received by the site, 
        including but not limited to the following: limited and controlled access 
        by employees, servers and data stored in a secured location, security 
        software where appropriate and cost effective. Employees are informed 
        of all security protocol on a regular basis, and web security procedures 
        are quality-assured weekly. </p>
      <p><span class="subhead"><a name="informationwecollect"></a>3. Information 
        Keen Collects<br>
        </span> <span class="body">Our primary goal in collecting personal information 
        from you is to provide you with a smooth and efficient experience while 
        using Keen. This allows us to provide services and features 
        that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make 
        your experience easier and quicker. We don't require you to register in 
        order to browse Keen, but you do need to register in 
        order to connect with other members of Keen via telephone 
        or Keen Mail.</span> </p>
      <p class="body">When you join Keen using our online registration 
        form, we collect an email address, member name, and password. Your member 
        name is used throughout Keen to identify you to other 
        Keen Members. Therefore, you should be aware that if 
        you use your real name as your Member name, this information would be 
        visible to others on the site. You can also join Keen 
        via 800Predict.com using the co-branded online registration form. Keen 
        members who join Keen through the 800Predict.com co-branded 
        online registration form and through Keen's online registration 
        form are subject to the Keen privacy policy.</p>
      <p><span class="body">Because we connect members by telephone, we require 
        you to enter a valid telephone number to connect with other members through 
        Keen. At no time will we share your telephone number 
        with anyone, including those members with whom you communicate through 
        Keen. Because Keen initiates all telephone 
        calls, no one can see your telephone number - not even with Caller ID. 
        Although the Keen system maintains the connection between 
        the two parties, we do not monitor or record the content of telephone 
        calls made through Keen. </span></p>
      <p><span class="body">We use your email address to contact you regarding 
        administrative notices, new product offerings, and communications relevant 
        to your use of Keen. If you do not wish to receive these 
        communications, you have the ability to stop receiving these communications 
        by sending your member name and email address to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@keen.com">unsubscribe@keen.com</a> 
        or by unchecking the box on the Personal Info page which asks whether 
        they wish to receive such mailings. You can also stop receiving the newsletter 
        by replying to the newsletter email with "unsubscribe" as the subject 
        line. You may also unsubscribe by calling Keen Help at 1-877-533-6435.</span></p>
      <p class="body">You will receive administrative emails that are related 
        to the primary usage and functionality of <span class="body">Keen</span>. 
        You may not opt-out of administrative emails.</p>
      <p class="body">If you are earning money on Keen, we collect 
        additional information from you so we can process and remit to you your 
        KeenSpeaker fees. We collect your mailing address to remit payments, and 
        we collect your social security number and/or Federal Tax ID number to 
        prepare Form 1099s if necessary. We will never share this information 
        with third parties. Members who are not United States taxpayers will not 
        be asked for their social security numbers or Federal Tax ID numbers, 
        though they <span class="body">may need to report income to their local 
        tax authority.</span></p>
      <p><span class="body">Keen collects credit card information 
        when you add money to your Keen account. Keen 
        uses a third party to process credit cards for billing purposes. This 
        third party does not store or retain any of a member's personally identifiable 
        information. In certain cases, we will also use credit card information 
        to verify age in order to provide access to certain areas of the site. 
        We do not charge or bill the credit card when we collect credit card information 
        for age verification purposes. </span> </p>
      <p class="body">You can review, update and change your personally identifiable 
        information -- including your name, e-mail address, telephone number, 
        password and PIN number -- by clicking on the Personal Info link on the 
        My Keen page. You can review, update or change your address and credit 
        card information -- if you have supplied it -- by going to the My Keen 
        page on the Site, clicking on the link to the My Account page, and then 
        clicking on the Credit Card Information link. You may correct, update 
        or delete any of your Keen listings by <span class="body">clicking 
        on the My Listings link on the My Keen page. You may also update or correct 
        information by calling Keen Help at 1-877-533-6435, or you may write to 
        Keen at Keen Customer Support, PO Box 
        418, San Francisco CA 94104-0418.</span></p>
      <p><span class="body">If you choose to include your personal information 
        in the Keen search feature, your name and email address 
        will help others find listings you have created. For example, if a person 
        knows that a friend is a member of Keen, but doesn't 
        know the friend's member name, that person can search for any listings 
        that the friend has created by typing in the friend's first name, last 
        name, or email address in the search field. We will never disclose member 
        names or email addresses during the search process unless you choose to 
        make this information available, and you can remove themselves from the 
        search feature by clicking on the Personal Info link from the My Keen 
        page.</span></p>
      <p><span class="body">You may also provide Keen additional 
        profile information (such as experience, credentials, affiliations, on-call 
        schedule, etc.) that is displayed publicly on the Site in your homepage 
        or in your listings. Other than the profile information submitted by our 
        members, and except as noted herein, Keen does not disclose 
        any personally identifying information without your permission.</span></p>
      <p><span class="body">Keen's Tell a Friend Program allows 
        members to earn money by referring their friends to our Site. The contact 
        information you enter as part of Keen's Tell a Friend 
        program will be used only to personalize a one-time referral e-mail sent 
        to your friends.</span></p>
      <p class="body">We use information we maintain about you, and other information 
        we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve 
        disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Member Agreement. At times, 
        we may look at your account information and transaction history to identify 
        problems or resolve disputes. Moreover, such information is never completely 
        removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact we 
        back up our systems. Therefore, our members' personally identifiable information 
        may not be completely removed from our databases in response to member 
        requests.</p>
      <p class="body">Keen also facilitates communication among 
        members through our on-site Keen Mail system. Messages sent via Keen Mail 
        are identified only by your member name, and we do not reveal either member's 
        personal e-mail address.</p>
      <p class="body">Keen may use certain information collected 
        from our members in aggregate form to tailor our members' experience at 
        the Site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, 
        and displaying the content according to your preferences. We may also 
        use this information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts.</p>
      <p class="body">Keen uses cookies. Cookies are small amounts 
        of data sent to a user's browser from the Keen Web servers 
        and stored on a user's computer's hard drive. Keen uses 
        cookies to track the pages on the Site that our users have visited. This 
        allows us to collect aggregate information about usage on the Site. Keen 
        may also use cookies to deliver content specific to members' interests, 
        and to keep track of members' member names and passwords so that members 
        do not have to reenter them during a session. If you choose not to accept 
        cookies, you will be unable to use the Keen web site.</p>
      <p class="body">Keen uses your IP addresses to help diagnose 
        problems with our server and to administer the Site. Generally, IP addresses 
        tell us the location from which a person is connecting to us, what service 
        provider the person is using, and which parts of the Site the User is 
        visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. 
        This means that your session will be tracked, but you will remain anonymous. 
        We reserve the right to track IP addresses for the purposes of fraud prevention, 
        and we reserve the right to release IP addresses to legal authorities.</p>
      <p class="body">If you send Keen e-mail correspondence, 
        or if other members or other third parties send us e-mail or other correspondence 
        regarding a particular member's activities or postings on the Site, Keen 
        may collect such information.</p>
      <p class="body"><span class="subhead"><a name="disclosure"></a>4. Our Disclosure 
        of Your Information.</span><br>
        We do not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifiable information 
        to third parties, and we do not use members' mailing address information 
        for unsolicited marketing. The only exceptions are when we either have 
        your permission or we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 
        For example, in some cases, the government can compel the disclosure of 
        information about you, and Keen will need to comply if 
        it believes such disclosure to be appropriate, in which case you authorize 
        it to do so. You also consent to Keen disclosing information 
        about you to actual or potential parties to a lawsuit that Keen 
        is or may become involved in (a) if it required to do so, (b) if it reasonably 
        believes that such disclosures will potentially mitigate its liability, 
        or (c) to enforce its rights. Keen may disclose some 
        personally identifiable information to third party service providers in 
        connection with communications and payments to users and other aspects 
        of operation of the site. Keen uses a third-party newsletter 
        company to deliver Keen newsletters, and we share your 
        email address with this newsletter company. Third parties will be under 
        extensive confidentiality restrictions.</p>
      <p class="body">We may from time to time run promotions in which we ask 
        visitors for demographic information (like their zip code, state/province 
        or age). We may also run contests on Keen in which we 
        ask visitors for demographic information. We use this data to tailor your 
        experience, showing content that we think you might be interested in, 
        and displaying the content according to your preferences. We also use 
        demographic information to determine eligibility for certain contests.</p>
      <p class="body">From time to time Keen may ask members 
        to participate in surveys. Such surveys may ask visitors for contact information 
        (like their email address). We use contact data from our surveys to send 
        information about our company. </p>
      <p class="body">In order to enhance your listings, you may <a href="/credentials/credentials_agreement.asp">verify</a> 
        your professional and academic credentials through Absolute Backgrounds, 
        a leading provider of comprehensive background checks on individuals. 
        You may submit information to be verified by <a href="http://www.backgroundsonline.com/">Backgrounds 
        Online</a> (such as academic degrees and professional licenses) on the
