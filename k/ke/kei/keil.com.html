</p>


<h3>With Whom is the Information Shared?</h3>

<p>
<b><font color="#800000">Keil Software</font></b> will not sell, share, or rent this information to
others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.
</p>

<p>
We may occasionally share aggregated <b> demographic</b> information with our tool partners. This
information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
</p>

<p>
We use outside shipping companies (like FedEx, UPS, Airborne, USPS, and courier
services) to ship orders. Therefore, we must provide your name, mailing address,
and phone number to them. If you do not wish us to share this information, you
may pick up your product from our offices.
</p>

<p>
We accept credit card orders and, on occasion, must provide the customer name
and address information to VISA, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover for
verification purposes. If you do not wish us to verify your credit card, you may
use an alternate form of payment.
</p>

<p>
We partner with other embedded tools companies and chip manufacturers to provide you with important or
interesting information about products or services that you may find beneficial. On occasion, we provide names
and other contact information that are necessary for these companies to provide such information
via a one-time mailing. Information transferred is used for only one mailing. <font size="2">To
prevent the sharing of your information with these companies, refer to the </font>section
on <a href="#OptOut">opting-out</a>.

<h3><a name="Security"></a>What Security Precautions are in Effect?</h3>

<p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="/_include/verisign_rt.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<a href="https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/d5bdae13abd5799759e12c3c650c78da" target="_blank"><img src="/images/verisignseal.gif" border="0" width="59" height="67" align="right" alt="Verisign Seal"></a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="25599" -->
<b><font color="#800000">Keil Software</font></b> takes every precaution to
protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website,
that information is protected both online and off-line.
</p>

<p>
All forms on this web site are available in both non-secure and secure formats.
Secure forms encrypt and protect information with the best encryption software in
the industry -- SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web
browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked,
as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just <i>surfing</i>. To learn more
about SSL, refer to <a href="http://www.verisign.com">http://www.verisign.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do
everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All information,
not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted
in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job
(for example, our accounts receivable clerk or technical support personnel) are granted
access to personally identifiable information. All database access is
password-protected. Our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every
quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified
and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to
ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store
personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure, locked environment.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email
to <a href="mailto:security@keil.com">security@keil.com</a>.
</p>


<h3><a name="Cookies"></a>Cookies</h3>

<p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing
information about the user. Most of the forms on this web site attempt to store and/or retrieve
cookies from your computer. The cookies requested contain information such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name,</li>
  <li>Title,</li>
  <li>Company Name,</li>
  <li>Address,</li>
  <li>Phone &amp; FAX Numbers,</li>
  <li>E-mail Address,</li>
  <li>and Product Serial Number.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you enter and submit your personal information in a form on our web site, we send your
browser a cookie that contains this information. Cookies we send are set to expire in 180 days (6
months). Subsequent visits to a form on our web site request the cookie and automatically
fill-in the form. We automatically complete forms this way to save you time and avoid the
redundant entry of information.
</p>

<p>
If you are concerned about cookies we store on your computer, you may disable cookies in your
browser. If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site. The only drawback is that the
information in the cookie must be manually entered each time you return to one of our forms. For example,
each time you download an update your user information must be re-entered.
</p>


<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the web site, and gather broad demographic
information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
</p>


<h3>Links</h3>

<p>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that <b><font color="#800000"> Keil Software</font></b> is
not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you read the privacy statements of
each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. In
most cases, a new browser window opens when you link out of the Keil web site.
</p>


<p>
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Keil Software Web site.
</p>


<h3>Surveys</h3>

<p>
From time-to-time our web site requests information via user surveys. Participation in
a survey is completely voluntary and you, therefore, have a choice of whether or not
to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information
(such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code,
age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving
the use and satisfaction of this site.
</p>


<h3>Correcting or Updating Personal Information</h3>

<p>
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code),
or if you no longer desire our service, we endeavor to provide a way to
correct, update, or remove the personal data provided to us. Contact our
<a href="/product/custserv.htm">customer service department</a> to make
changes to your personal information.
</p>

<p>
We do not offer a way to retrieve the information you provide us on-line. However,
you may use the <a href="/product/custserv.asp">Customer Information Maintenance Form</a>
to request a copy of your personal information.
</p>

<h3><a name="OptOut"></a>Opting Out</h3>

<p>
We want to give you every opportunity to opt-out of receiving undesired mailings or
e-mail from us or from our partners.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may <a href="/update/remove.asp">remove your e-mail address</a> from our Update List Server.</li>
  <li>You may <a href="/product/custserv.asp">block the sharing of your
    information</a> with third parties.</li>
  <li>You may <a href="/product/custserv.asp">remove or update your personal information</a> maintained in our customer database.</li>
  <li>Contact our <a href="/product/custserv.htm">customer service department</a> for any other requests you may have.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To remove your e-mail address from one of our list servers, follow the directions at the bottom
of the e-mail.
</p>


<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>

<p>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes at
<a href="http://www.keil.com/company/privacy_changes.htm">http://www.keil.com/company/privacy_changes.htm</a>
so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and
under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide
to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that
stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by e-mail. You will
have a choice as to whether or not we may use your information in this
different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy
under which the information was collected.
