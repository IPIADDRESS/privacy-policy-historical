<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>At Keil Software, we understand that privacy is a concern of many of our customers. For that
reason, we have established the following policies concerning the information we collect on our web
site.</p>

<h3>Who Collects the Information from this Site?</h3>

<p><b><font color="#800000">
Keil Software</font></b>  collects and is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.</p>

<h3>Where is Information Collected?</h3>

<p>
<b><font color="#800000"> Keil Software</font></b> collects information at several different points on
this web site including the following forms:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.keil.com/support/register.htm">Product Registration</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="/update/">Downloading a Product Update</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="/support/gethelp.htm">Requesting Technical Support</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="/product/prices.htm">Requesting a Quote</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="/product/literature.asp">Requesting Product Information</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="/training/">Registering for a Training Course</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="/update/list.asp">Adding your name to our E-mail List</a>,</li>
  <li>and <a href="/demo/cdrom.htm">Requesting a FREE CD-ROM</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These forms request you to enter personal information that is sent to <b><font color="#800000">Keil
Software</font></b> over the internet. You may select to use our secure server
(SSL/HTTPS pages) to ensure that the information you send is encrypted and secure.</p>

<h3>What Information is Collected?</h3>

<p>The information that is collected typically consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name,</li>
  <li>Title,</li>
  <li>Company Name,</li>
  <li>Address,</li>
  <li>Phone &amp; FAX Numbers,</li>
  <li>E-mail Address,</li>
  <li>and Product Serial Number.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How is the Information Used?</h3>

<p>
We use the information you enter to maintain our customer database.
</p>

<p>
From time-to-time we send mail to this database. If you wish to be excluded from our
mailings, please contact our <a href="/product/sales.htm">sales department</a>.
</p>

<p>
Demographic information is used to determine trends in our customers' use of our products. This
helps us design new products and services that help our customer meet their goals.
</p>

<p>
E-mail addresses are <b>NEVER</b> used for SPAM or unsolicited e-mail messages. E-mail addresses
<b>ARE</b> used to help us connect the e-mail messages you send us to your database record.
</p>

<p>
Some forms ask if you would like to receive an e-mail message when a new software update is
posted to the web site. If you do not wish to receive e-mail notifications of these updates, make
sure that you un-check the controls in these forms.
</p>


<h3>With Whom is the Information Shared?</h3>

<p>
<b><font color="#800000">Keil Software</font></b> will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different
from what is disclosed in this statement.
</p>

<p>
We may occasionally share aggregated <b> demographic</b> information with our tool partners. This information is not linked to any personal information that can identify
any individual person.
</p>

<p>
We use outside shipping companies (like FedEx, UPS, and Airborne) to ship orders, and a credit card processing
company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain,
share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary
purposes.
</p>

<p>
We partner with other companies to provide our customers with important or interesting
information about products or services that they may find beneficial. On occasion, we provide names
and other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide such information
(usually via mail).
</p>


<h3><a name="Security"></a>What Security Precautions are in Effect?</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/55464fbce992c07ab00982a6524b5f46" target="new">
    <img border="0" src="/images/VeriSignSeal.gif" alt="Verisign Logo" align="right" width="79" height="88"></a><b><font color="#800000">Keil Software</font></b>
takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.
When users submit sensitive information via the website, that information
is protected both online and off-line.
</p>

<p>
  All forms on this web site are available in both non-secure and secure formats.
Secure forms encrypt and protect information with the best encryption software in the industry -- SSL. While on a
secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such
as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to
un-locked, or open, when you are just <i>surfing</i>. To learn more about SSL,
refer to <a href="http://www.verisign.com">http://www.verisign.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do
everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’
information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted
in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job
(for example, our accounts receivable clerk or technical support personnel) are granted
access to personally identifiable information. All database access is
password-protected. Our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every
quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified
and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to
ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store
personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure, locked environment.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email
to <a href="mailto:security@keil.com">security@keil.com</a>.
</p>


<h3><a name="Cookies"></a>Cookies</h3>

<p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing
information about the user. Most of the forms on this web site attempt to store and/or retrieve
cookies from your computer. The cookies requested contain information such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name,</li>
  <li>Title,</li>
  <li>Company Name,</li>
  <li>Address,</li>
  <li>Phone &amp; FAX Numbers,</li>
  <li>E-mail Address,</li>
  <li>and Product Serial Number.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you enter and submit your personal information in a form on our web site, we send your
browser a cookie that contains this information. Cookies we send are set to expire in 180 days (6
months). Subsequent visits to a form on our web site request the cookie and automatically fills-in
the form. We automatically complete forms this way to save you time and avoid the redundant entry
of information.
</p>

<p>
If you are concerned about cookies we store on your computer, you may disable cookies in your
browser. If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site. The only drawback is that the
information in the cookie must be manually entered each time you return to one of our forms. For example,
the next time you download an update, your user information must be re-entered.
</p>


<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s
movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
</p>


<h3>Links</h3>

<p>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that <b><font color="#800000"> Keil Software</font></b> is
not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our
users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of
each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This
privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Keil Software Web site.
</p>


<h3>Surveys</h3>

<p>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys
is completely voluntary
and the user, therefore, has a choice of whether or not to disclose this information.
Information requested may include contact information (such as name and
shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Survey
information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and
satisfaction of this site.
</p>


<h3>Correction or Updating Personal Information</h3>

<p>
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code),
or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to
correct, update, or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. Contact our <a href="/product/sales.htm">sales
department</a> to make changes to your personal information.
</p>

<h3>Opting Out</h3>

<p>
We want to give you every opportunity to opt-out of receiving undesired mailings or e-mail.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a <a href="/update/remove.asp">web form</a> to remove your e-mail address from our Update
    List,</li>
  <li>Contact our <a href="/product/sales.htm">sales department</a>  to remove your address from our
    database or to stop receiving mass mailings.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To remove your e-mail address from one of our list servers, follow the directions at the bottom
of the e-mail.
</p>


<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>

<p>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes at <a href="http://www.keil.com/company/privacy_changes.htm">http://www.keil.com/company/privacy_changes.htm</a> so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we
use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point
we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from
that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an
e-mail.
Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this
different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy
under which the information was collected.
