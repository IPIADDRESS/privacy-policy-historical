<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>If any dispute arises between Us regarding any provision of these Terms and Conditions, or its application or termination, then We agree that We will attempt to resolve our dispute informally by means of joint co–operation or discussion between the parties directly involved in the dispute within 5 days after that dispute arises or such extended time period as We may agree to with You.</p>
<p>In the event that We are unable to informally resolve our dispute, that dispute shall be finally resolved in accordance with the Rules of the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa by an arbitrator appointed by the Foundation. Arbitration proceedings shall take place in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permissible by applicable law:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>this clause shall constitute your irrevocable consent to the arbitration proceedings, and You shall not be entitled to withdraw your consent or to claim that You are not bound by this clause. We may, at our discretion, waive this clause and permit our dispute to be resolved using an alternate dispute resolution process;</li>
    <li>Any award that may be made by the arbitrator:–
    <ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>shall be final and binding;</li>
        <li>will be carried into effect; and</li>
        <li>may be made an order of any court to whose jurisdiction the parties to the dispute are subject.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Notwithstanding the aforegoing, nothing in this clause shall be construed as precluding either Party from applying to court for a temporary interdict or other relief of an urgent nature, pending the decision of the award of the arbitrator in terms of this clause.</p>
<p>This clause is severable from the rest of this agreement and shall therefore remain of full force and effect even if this agreement is terminated or cancelled for any reason at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Governing law and jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>The Sites are controlled and maintained from our facilities in the Gauteng province of the Republic of South Africa. You irrevocably agree that the law of the Republic of South Africa shall govern the Sites and these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>You consent to the jurisdiction of the South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg, South Africa in respect of disputes which may arise out of your Access to the Sites and these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You also irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court (in the event that we exercise proceedings in such Court) even though the value of a claim which We may have against You may exceed the ordinary monetary jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court.</p>
<p><strong>Legal service of documents and notices</strong></p>
<p>We choose the addresses below for all communication purposes under these Terms and Conditions, whether in respect of court process, notices or other documents or communications of whatsoever nature.</p>
<p>We may monitor your communications</p>
<p>Subject to the provisions of the RIC Act, You agree to permit Us to intercept, block, filter, read, delete, disclose and use all communications You send or Post to or using the Sites and/or to our staff and/or employees.</p>

<p>Any provision in these Terms and Conditions which is or may become illegal, invalid or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability and shall be treated pro non scripto (as if it were not written) and severed from these Terms and Conditions, without invalidating the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
<p>If You breach any of these Terms and Conditions, We may immediately, automatically and without notice to You, terminate your Access to the Sites, and/or prohibit your future Access to the Sites, and/or take appropriate legal action against You (including without limitation, applying for urgent and/or interim relief or claiming damages), without incurring any liability to You of any nature whatsoever and howsoever arising, and all of our rights in this regard are expressly reserved.</p>
