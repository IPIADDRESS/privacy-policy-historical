Privacy Policy 
KFOX-TV respects the privacy of visitors to our site. This Privacy Policy governs the use and collection of information from you by KTVU Partnership, d/b/a KFOX-TV ("KFOX-TV"), and its subsidiaries ("we" or "us").  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our privacy practices. By visiting any of our sites, you agree that your visit, and any dispute over our privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Visitor Agreement.

Questions regarding privacy issues should be directed to:

<b>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY </b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We won't knowingly collect personally identifying information from anyone under 13 years of age. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our websites, and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. Third party providers featured on or linked to by our websites, such as vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>User Supplied Information</b>.  To make use of certain features on our websites (such as comment forms or opinion surveys) visitors may need to provide certain information, for example, your name, email address, sex, age, home address or zip code, and we might request information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions on our sites. If you enter one of these promotions, you'll have to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) so that we can contact you if you win. We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the promotion, which we will identify in the official rules. If you don't want us to collect the information requested in the registration form or to provide it to contest co-sponsors, please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Cookies</b>.  To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, if you will, that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself, we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or services through our sites may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. For example, we use cookies to avoid showing you the same ad, repeatedly, during a single visit. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our sites visited by our users. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to our sites. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Other Tracking Tools</b>.  Our web pages may contain electronic images (called "single-pixel GIFs" or "web beacons") that allow us and our vendors to count users who have visited particular pages or to access certain cookies.  We may use these tools and other technologies to recognize which pages users visit, and which links they click on. We may also be able to track your online purchases from us or from third party sites that have agreed to share such information with us.  
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>IP Addresses</b>.  Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our sites. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally to us. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our sites to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our sites. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Vendors and Service Providers</b>.  To make our sites more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Chat, email newsletters and free email services, for example, may be made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services.  In some instances, these third party providers will have the same access to your information as we do. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"> 
<b>Sites to Which We Link</b>.  Of course, our sites include links to plenty of other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our websites, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. And when you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services through one of our sites, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it appears that you're on KFOX-TV-branded pages throughout the transaction. The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of our provider partners via a link either from the site's homepage or from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Advertisers</b>.  When we present information to our advertisers -- to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our websites -- it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our sites. From time to time, we may share more particularized information on visitors to our sites with those marketing products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Statistical Information</b>.  Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic that visits various pages within our sites, and the habits and preferences of our audience.  Such aggregated information does not include any information that would identify you personally.  We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to third parties as we see fit.  
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>Other Disclosures</b>.  We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Visitor Agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our sites, the public, or KFOX-TV. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that KFOX-TV, the bulk of our assets, or one or more of our sites is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>OPTING OUT OF EMAILS</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
When you submit information to us in connection with us for any feature of our website, you may receive an email newsletter from us from time to time updating you on the same or related features of our website.  At the time you submit your information, we will provide you with the opportunity to tell us that you do not want to receive email newsletters or other correspondence from us.  If you so indicate, we will not send you any further email correspondence without your consent.
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>STORAGE OF INFORMATION</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
All information gathered on any of our websites is encrypted for storage within a database operated by us or by a contractor on our behalf. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable.  We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
<b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY  </b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">
A final note: The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before they take effect.
