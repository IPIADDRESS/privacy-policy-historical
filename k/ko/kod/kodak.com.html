</p><p class="heading2">Your Choices about Receiving Email

</p><p>Kodak may send you e-mail about your orders or your account and in response to your questions.

</p><p>Kodak implements a variety of administrative, managerial, and technical security measures to help protect your personal information.  Kodak has Internal Control Standards which relate specifically to the handling of personal information.   These include certain controls to help safeguard the information we collect online.
