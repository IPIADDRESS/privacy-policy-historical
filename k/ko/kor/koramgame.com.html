    <div id="dh_txt" style="height: auto;"> <strong><br>
      Introduction</strong> 
      <p>This is the privacy policy of Koram Game Inc. and any companies within 
        our group (referred to collectively as "Koram Game," “Koram”). 
        It applies to all of our websites / services (referred to collectively 
        as "our websites") on which it appears.</p>
      <p>Please read this policy carefully. Your accepting it in full is a condition 
        of your use of our websites (whether or not you are a subscriber). If 
        you do not agree with this policy, or any part, please do not use our 
        websites. Your using any of our websites is treated as an acceptance of 
        the version of this policy in effect at the time of your use. <br>
        If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us 
        by emailing support(at)koramgame.com and do not use our websites until 
        you are satisfied and can accept this policy in its entirety. </p>
      <p>In this privacy policy, "Koram Products" is used as shorthand 
        for all versions of "Three Kingdoms Online" and "King of 
        Kungfu", and any other online games released by Koram from time to 
        time including all Koram websites used to play those games. </p>
      <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and take special measures 
        to ensure the confidentiality of personally identifiable information collected 
        from or about you. This privacy policy explains how we collect, store 
        and use such personally identifiable information. ("Personally identifiable 
        information" is information that identifies you and can be used to 
        contact or locate you in real life, such as your real full name, e-mail 
        address, mobile telephone number, postal address.) </p>
      <p>References to "Terminating" an account include all or any of: 
        locking / suspending, temporarily banning or permanently banning the account.</p>
      <p><strong><br>
        What personal information is collected?</strong></p>
      <p>Koram only collects personal information on a voluntary basis. If an 
        on-line visitor submits information to Koram, it will usually take the 
        form of either: (1) the purchase of goods or services though our on-line 
        stores, (2) product or account registration, or registration for on-line 
        game participation, (3) player match-up services, (4) message boards, 
        (5) warranty registrations, (6) contest registrations, (7) a consumer 
        complaint, (8) surveys, (9) customer service or technical support, and/or 
        (10) newsletters. Personal information collected may include your name, 
        home address, phone number, and/or e-mail address. We do not require this 
        information to gain access to our sites, however, you will not be able 
        to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration 
        or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided. 
      </p>
      <p>Visitors purchasing products or services through our on-line stores will 
        be required to provide additional information such as a valid credit card 
        number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses. <br>
        Please note that, depending on the Koram site that you are visiting, many 
        of the activities listed above may not be available and, as such, personal 
        information may not be collected. </p>
      <p><strong><br>
        What other information is collected and stored?</strong></p>
      <p>We use cookies, collect and store IP-addresses, alphanumeric IDs and 
        other unique identifiers in order to identify specific computers that 
        access our websites. We identify and store the versions of Java and .NET 
        (if any) on your computer along with your browser and operating system. 
      </p>
      <p>We generate and store logs indicating usage of our websites such as activity 
        in our games and public and private chat communications. This includes 
        monitoring play patterns and anti-tamper checks which verify the correct 
        internal operation of our software and are designed to spot abusive or 
        inappropriate activities. </p>
      <p>We may track your use of certain features and areas of our websites to 
        help us improve them. </p>
      <p>If our client software held on your computer fails, it sends an automatic 
        error report to our server to help us fix it. This error report only includes 
        information about the internal state of our own client software and which 
        browser/java version it is running on. It does not include data from elsewhere 
        on your system and so does not reveal personally identifiable information 
        to us. </p>
      <p>We store 'save game' and 'game settings' information to enable us to 
        provide a better games service in which your activities and achievements 
        are remembered in the game, and we conduct polls to find better ways of 
        serving the needs of our users. </p>
      <p><strong><br>
        Children's privacy practices of Koram</strong></p>
      <p>The provision of Koram Products to anyone under 18 years of age is not 
        conditioned on the collection of more personal information than is reasonably 
        necessary for participation.</p>
      <p><strong><br>
        How We Use Your Information provided/collected?</strong></p>
      <p>The information we collect may be used: <br>
        i. To provide our customer support service, and to verify any claims or 
        requests you make if you use our customer support service. <br>
        ii. To enforce our terms and conditions, and prevent or detect hacking 
        activities, security breaches or safety risks in connection with our websites. 
        <br>
        iii. To send service announcements and messages (for example, a reminder 
        sent to the members' Message Centre if a subscription payment is due or 
        if member credit has expired). <br>
        iv. To aggregate information to generate anonymous statistics regarding 
        use of our websites. We may share this anonymous information with our 
        partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information 
        that can identify any individual person. <br>
        v. For our own internal marketing and demographic studies and to help 
        us improve our websites. <br>
        vi. In the event of an actual or proposed (including as part of negotiations 
        for any) merger, or business combination or sale of substantially all 
        of our assets or a business operation to which such information relates, 
        or as provided under bankruptcy or applicable insolvency laws or by the 
        enforcement of equitable rights. <br>
        vii. To disclose information to the extent required by law, court order, 
        as requested by other government, regulatory or law enforcement authority, 
        to protect or assist in protecting our users, systems or the public, or 
        to otherwise enforce legal rights as determined in our sole and absolute 
        discretion. <br>
        viii. If you have agreed on our websites, to send you email newsletters 
        about our games, including new game features and special offers. <br>
        ix. As set out elsewhere in our privacy policy. <br>
        We care about protecting your privacy, and with the exception of the uses 
        specified above, we will not sell, transfer, rent out, share or disclose 
        your personally identifiable information to other companies. </p>
      <p><strong><br>
        Cookies</strong></p>
      <p>A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers 
        to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that 
        the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain 
        the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" 
        of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. 
        <br>
        Session cookies are temporary, and remain in the cookie file of your browser 
        until you leave the site. We use session cookies to enable us to authenticate 
        users during game sessions. </p>
      <p>Persistent cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for a specific 
        period. Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred 
        interests more quickly. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies cannot 
        be used by themselves to identify you. <br>
        We use persistent cookies to track your country (to enable us to provide 
        country-specific content) and to track whether you entered our websites 
        from a link on site of one of our business partners. Persistent cookies 
        also allow you to login when you return to our site, by storing your login 
        information on your own computer. Additionally we may use persistent cookies 
        to store information about which adverts from our site have been displayed 
        to you to help avoid showing the same one repeatedly or to provide information 
        that we hope will meet your needs or interests. </p>
      <p>Our advertisers and technology partners also use cookies and other similar 
        technologies. For more information about this, see under "Third Parties" 
        below. </p>
      <p><strong><br>
        Third Parties</strong></p>
      <p>We may supply your personal information to external third parties who 
        provide a service to us (such as fulfillment of orders placed for Koram 
        Product merchandise or to assist us in the supply of customer support) 
        and purely for the purpose of that service. <br>
        We partner with a number of external payment service provider companies 
        to enable you to make payment via a wide range of payment options. We 
        share your billing information with such companies insofar as is necessary 
        for the processing of your payment or to prevent or detect fraud. These 
        companies have agreed not to retain, share, store or use your personally 
        identifiable information which we pass to them for any secondary purposes. 
      </p>
      <p>Please note that this privacy policy does not apply to any of your personal 
        information which is collected by the external payment provider companies 
        themselves or to the websites or services of other companies to which 
        we link or which link to us, or which provide goods or services to our 
        users from their websites (such as co-branded, white label or affiliate 
        sites or other sites selling Koram Product merchandise). Please note that 
        those companies (and not Koram) are responsible for the information which 
        they collect. Please check their privacy polices where appropriate. </p>
      <p>We use external companies to provide and serve adverts or other technologies 
        on our websites (eg to collect website statistics or to enable sharing 
        of buttons or widgets). These companies may use information (not including 
        personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email 
        address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites 
        in order to personalize advertisements on this site or other sites and 
        /or to personalize certain features on our site and/or to provide anonymised 
        aggregated statistics concerning use of our site or use of certain features 
        on our site which are shared with other sites (eg buttons or widgets linking 
        to our site). We do not have access to or control over cookies or other 
        technologies that these third parties may use and the information practices 
        of these advertisers and technology companies are not covered by this 
        policy. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, information collected from our users by third parties providing 
        goods or services (including adverts) at or via our websites may be shared 
        by those third parties with us and stored by us for the purposes stated 
        in this policy. </p>
      <p>Be very careful before making or posting any communications on our websites. 
        Certain information is visible to other players of the game including: 
        public and private chat communications, the appearance of your characters 
        and your experience points. Players who include you on their friends list 
        can see which in-game world you are playing on. </p>
      <p>If you have agreed on our websites, we may provide your email address 
        to our business partners so that they can send you emails with details 
        of goods or services which may be of interest to you including information 
        about special offers or promotions. </p>
      <p><strong><br>
        Safeguarding your personally identifiable information</strong></p>
      <p>We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent 
        we believe it reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, 
        and will protect it using the same level of safeguards we use to ensure 
        the security, integrity and privacy of our own equivalent proprietary 
        information. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that 
        third parties to whom we transfer any personally identifiable information 
        in accordance with this policy will agree to provide sufficient protection. 
        We may store or transfer personal information outside the European Economic 
        Area for the purposes stated in this policy. </p>
      <p>Note that while we strive to protect all our personally identifiable 
        information, we have all heard of data breaches in well-respected financial 
        and governmental institutions and we cannot ever fully guarantee that 
        such breaches will not happen. We will inform you of any material data 
        breaches that we discover that may compromise your personally identifiable 
        information.</p>
      <p><strong><br>
        Transfer of Information</strong></p>
      <p>We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event 
        of a transfer of ownership of Koram or the acquisition of substantially 
        all the assets of Koram related to the business which collected such information, 
        such as acquisition by or merger with another company. <br>
