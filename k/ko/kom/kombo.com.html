		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>


<p>Here at Advanced Media Network we pride ourselves on user service, and part of that is looking after your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you visit our site.

</p><p>The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address or email address

<b></b></p><p><b>Cookies</b>
</p><p>On some pages, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies the user when they log in. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features may not function properly without cookies.
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Data collection</b>
</p><p>Advanced Media Network collects limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your visit and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services.

</p><p>Most of our services require you to register for an account. Advanced Media Network asks you for some personal information in order to create an account (name, email address and a password for your account) and we will use that information to provide the service. The rest of the information you may wish to provide in your profile is used only by other viewers to the site, and you can be selective as to which information you enter.
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Information sharing</b>
</p><p>We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to other companies or individuals.

</p><p>If you have an account, we may share the information submitted among the other services in Advanced Media Network in order to provide you with the best experience possible.

</p><p>We may share aggregated information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who have visited a certain page.

</p><p><b>Information security</b>
</p><p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Links</b>
</p><p>Any sites linked to on Advanced Media Network are developed by people over whom we exercise no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information.
