<li><strong>What information do We collect from or about you?&nbsp;</strong>In order to better provide you with many products and services, each of our websites may collect two types of information about you: Personally Identifiable Information and Non Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience while using our Websites and/or newsletters.&nbsp;<strong><em>Personally Identifiable Information:</em></strong>&nbsp;"Personally Identifiable Information" refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. This information can be used to identify, contact or locate you. Personally Identifiable Information is requested when you register with us, order a product or service, fill out surveys, participate in contests or sweepstakes, correspond with us, or otherwise volunteer information. Personally Identifiable Information may include all or part of the following: Your name, physical mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, e-mail addresses and/or other identification and contact information as we may deem necessary. If you are using e-mail a friend on one of our Websites, we may ask you to provide the name, mailing address, e-mail address or other personal information. If you are making a purchase from us, we will also collect certain personal financial information such as your credit card number. We do not and will not store your credit card number.&nbsp;<strong><em>Non Personally Identifiable Information:</em></strong>&nbsp;"Non Personally Identifiable Information" refers to information that does not identify you as a specific individual by itself or in combination with other information. We may gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on any of our Websites. This information may be compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the website's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the Internet. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the Internet. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet, allowing Internet servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</li>
<li><strong>Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?&nbsp;</strong>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a superior and customized online experience. Among other things, we use customer contact information to orders, contact prior purchasers to inform them of their order status, to remind customers of events through our reminder service(s), to send our customers' friends or loved ones greetings, e-mails or hints to send our products through a greeting, e-mail a friend or hint service, and to send service and promotional e-mails.We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate customer behavior. This allows us to measure relative customer interest in the various areas of each of our Websites for product development purposes and to improve the design of our Websites. Any information we collect is used for our own internal purposes to improve the content and navigation of our Websites, to enhance users' experiences when visiting our Websites, to customize the content and/or layout of our pages, and to provide the services required by an individual user. We may also use information to notify consumers about updates to our Websites, to complete user initiated transactions, to trace false orders and to contact consumers directly, or through our third-party service partners, for marketing purposes. In addition, we may seek to update you or your recipients' personal information in our records through third party services that provide updated names, e-mails, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and other information. We may then use this acquired information to enhance our services or marketing efforts to you or your recipients.&nbsp;<strong>We gather information in the following ways:&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Shopping or Viewing Content:</em></strong>&nbsp;We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of activity on our Websites. We collect information from visitors to each of our Websites regarding the referring URL, your IP address, which browser you used to come to any one of our Websites, the country, state and telephone area code where your server is located, and the pages of any one of our Websites that you viewed during your visit.&nbsp;<em><strong>Ordering:</strong></em>&nbsp;When you order from us, we collect Personally Identifiable Information from you. If you order one of our products or services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone or mobile number, product selections, credit card number (or check or money order information if using such payment methods while ordering via mail), order number, referring URL, IP address and a password, as well as the recipient's name, address, telephone or mobile number and e-mail address. We collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order, or the recipient, as appropriate, and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contains and these changes will be automatically kept for future use.
