<li>Where do we collect that information and how do we use it?</li>

<li><strong>What information do We collect from or about you?</strong>In order to better provide you with many products and services, each of our websites may collect two types of information about you: Personally Identifiable Information and Non Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience while using our Websites and/or newsletters.<strong><em>Personally Identifiable Information:</em></strong>&nbsp;"Personally Identifiable Information" refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. This information can be used to identify, contact or locate you. Personally Identifiable Information is requested when you register with us, order a product or service, fill out surveys, participate in contests or sweepstakes, correspond with us, or otherwise volunteer information. Personally Identifiable Information may include all or part of the following: Your name, physical mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, e-mail addresses and/or other identification and contact information as we may deem necessary. If you are using e-mail a friend on one of our Websites, we may ask you to provide the name, mailing address, e-mail address or other personal information. If you are making a purchase from us, we will also collect certain personal financial information such as your credit card number. We do not and will not store your credit card number.<strong><em>Non Personally Identifiable Information:</em></strong>&nbsp;"Non Personally Identifiable Information" refers to information that does not identify you as a specific individual by itself or in combination with other information. We may gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on any of our Websites. This information may be compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the website's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the Internet. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the Internet. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet, allowing Internet servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</li>
<li><strong>Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?&nbsp;</strong>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a superior and customized online experience. Among other things, we use customer contact information to orders, contact prior purchasers to inform them of their order status, to remind customers of events through our reminder service(s), to send our customers' friends or loved ones greetings, e-mails or hints to send our products through a greeting, e-mail a friend or hint service, and to send service and promotional e-mails.We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate customer behavior. This allows us to measure relative customer interest in the various areas of each of our Websites for product development purposes and to improve the design of our Websites. Any information we collect is used for our own internal purposes to improve the content and navigation of our Websites, to enhance users' experiences when visiting our Websites, to customize the content and/or layout of our pages, and to provide the services required by an individual user. We may also use information to notify consumers about updates to our Websites, to complete user initiated transactions, to trace false orders and to contact consumers directly, or through our third-party service partners, for marketing purposes. In addition, we may seek to update you or your recipients' personal information in our records through third party services that provide updated names, e-mails, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and other information. We may then use this acquired information to enhance our services or marketing efforts to you or your recipients.<strong>We gather information in the following ways:</strong>
<p><strong><em>Shopping or Viewing Content:</em></strong>&nbsp;We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of activity on our Websites. We collect information from visitors to each of our Websites regarding the referring URL, your IP address, which browser you used to come to any one of our Websites, the country, state and telephone area code where your server is located, and the pages of any one of our Websites that you viewed during your visit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ordering:</strong></em>&nbsp;When you order from us, we collect Personally Identifiable Information from you. If you order one of our products or services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone or mobile number, product selections, credit card number (or check or money order information if using such payment methods while ordering via mail), order number, referring URL, IP address and a password, as well as the recipient's name, address, telephone or mobile number and e-mail address. We collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order, or the recipient, as appropriate, and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contains and these changes will be automatically kept for future use. If you cancel an order or do not complete an order we may collect and use any e-mail address or other information that you have entered as we would collect and use it if you had completed an order.</p>

However, the use of this information by any successor entity would still be governed by the terms of this Policy, as amended from time to time, including any amendment after such transaction, and you will continue to have the right to opt out of sharing your information with third parties.</p></li>
<li><strong>How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information?</strong>During the online ordering process you can review, change or delete the information that you have submitted. You may change any of your personal information in your account(s) online at any time. You may ask us in writing via postal mail to have the information on your account deleted, updated or corrected; however, because we keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Note that we may retain changed or deleted information for archival or other purposes.</li>
<li><strong>What are your choices regarding collection, use and distribution of your information?</strong>We may from time to time send you e-mail or other communications regarding current promotions, specials and new additions to our Websites. If you have supplied us with your telephone number(s) you may receive telephone calls from us with information or requests for information regarding an order you have placed. You may opt out, or unsubscribe from our newsletters at our newsletter management area:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.komando.com/newsletters/">http://www.komando.com/newsletters/</a>. If you make a purchase or an attempted purchase on one of our Websites or enter one of our contests or sweepstakes, you will be opted back in to our newsletters and promotional communications until you opt out or unsubscribe once again.If you are using the e-mail a friend service on one of our Websites, then you may have the option of sharing your Personally Identifiable Information and Non Personally Identifying Information, as well as information that you have entered regarding third parties, with others. If you share this information with third parties, these parties are not bound to follow this Policy and may disclose or use this information in ways we will not.</li>
<li><strong>What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?&nbsp;</strong>We employ reasonable security measures to protect the security of the information you submit to us. The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information associated with our customers is of utmost concern to us. Our secure servers protect this information using password protection and advanced encryption, and we may use firewall technology for additional protection.In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions are handled by established third-party banking institutions and process agents. With few exceptions, our order fulfillment is done by our own employees (personalized and/or customized products are typically fulfilled by those third-party vendors). In the case of third-party fulfillment, they receive the information they need to create and ship your order. When collecting credit card information for online purchases, we offer secured server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it. We do not store your credit card number. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access by physical security means.We also encourage our partners and service providers to adopt and follow stringent consumer privacy policies.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies.&nbsp;</strong>Like many other commercial websites, our Websites utilize standard technologies called "cookies" to collect information about how each of our Websites is used. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer's hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were designed to help a website recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie. Cookies can securely store a customer's password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections, such as those selected in a "shopping cart." For instance, cookies allow us to pre-populate (or fill in) an e-mail field with your e-mail address if you revisit one of our Websites and place an order. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, or capture your e-mail address.We send a cookie to your hard drive when you make an order to record the product name, category of product that you ordered, the amount paid, the order number and any referral codes. No Personally Identifiable Information is recorded. When you click through to any one of our Websites from a promotional e-mail, our third-party advertising service partner may send a cookie to your hard drive recording your IP address and other related information.</li>
<li><strong>Children, parental consent and privacy.&nbsp;</strong>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000, and imposes certain requirements on websites directed toward children under 13 that collect information on those children, or on websites that know they are collecting Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. We want to let you know that it is our policy not to collect Personally Identifiable Information from any person under 13 because children are not permitted to use the Websites or services on the Websites, and we request that children under the age of 13 not submit any personal information to us via the Websites. As one measure to ensure that we do not gather Personally Identifiable Information from children, we require that all individuals provide a valid credit card number before completing a purchase order. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered Personally Identifiable Information from children under 13, we shall attempt to notify such child's parent or guardian and erase such information from our records, unless the child's parent or guardian consents to our maintaining such information.</li>
