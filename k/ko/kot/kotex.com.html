		<h3 class="epsilon">Effective Date: January 1, 2015</h3>

		 <h3 class="zeta">Privacy</h3>
            <p>This Site is owned, operated and maintained by KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION ("Kimberly-Clark").  At Kimberly-Clark, we recognize that visitors to our Site may be concerned about the information they provide and how we treat that information. This Privacy Policy addresses those concerns.  The purpose of the Kimberly-Clark Privacy Policy is to describe how the websites and mobile applications owned or operated by Kimberly-Clark collect, share, and secure information.   Before you provide us with any personal information or otherwise browse our site, you should read through this Privacy Policy completely and make sure that you are comfortable with our privacy practices.  We may update the Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check in occasionally.</p>

            <h3 class="zeta">Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>At this Site, you may choose to provide Kimberly-Clark with information about yourself that is "personally identifiable information."  When we use the term “personally identifiable information,” we mean information that is collected in conjunction with your name.  Your use of this Site may provide other information about you that is not "personally identifiable information."  this information is not collected in conjunction with your name.  Kimberly-Clark does not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly.  You can visit this Site without providing us with personally identifiable information.    However, if you give us personally identifiable information, such as by asking to be put on our mailing list, we may contact you from time to time.</p>
            <p>You may connect with Kimberly-Clark or one of its websites through social networking websites, such as Facebook or Twitter.  If you initiate such a process, such as by “Liking” a Kimberly-Clark product on Facebook, you will be allowing Facebook to provide us with information from your Facebook profile.  Whenever submitting information on a social network website you should familiarize yourself with their privacy policy and practices.</p>

            <h3 class="zeta">How Information is Collected</h3>
            <p>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline">By Asking.</span> We may collect some information
                from you by asking that you provide it to us. For example, we may ask you for your
                email address on our website, or require you to provide us with information such
                as your birthday, telephone number, and address, so that you can sign up for our
                rewards programs or request a free sample. Personally identifiable information is
                collected from you directly and with your knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline">Cookies</span>. Like many companies, Kimberly-Clark
                uses “cookie” technology on our Site. Cookies are information stored
                on your computer by your browser to save your preferences while you are visiting
                a particular site. When you log in, the cookie tells us whether you visited us before
                or are a new visitor, and it enables us to learn which advertisements bring users
                to our website. The cookie doesn't obtain any personal information about you or
                provide us with any way to contact you. We do use the cookie to help us identify
                site features in which you have the greatest interest so that we can provide more
                of what you may want. If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies
                or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by
                following your browser’s help file directions. However, if you do not enable cookies
                to be received by your web browser, you may have trouble accessing some of the pages
                and certain features on this Site.</p>
            <p>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline">Web Beacons</span>. A web beacon is an
                electronic file on a Web page that allows us to count and recognize users who have
                visited that page. Among other things, a web beacon can be used in HTML-formatted
                email to determine responses to our communications and measure their effectiveness
                – for instance, if you get an email from us and click on a link in that email to
                go to our website. You can generally avoid web beacons in email by turning off HTML
                display and displaying only the text portion of your email.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline">Internet Protocol (IP) Address</span>.
                As you enter our websites, we capture and retain the IP address of the device you
                are using, such as a personal computer or a mobile device.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline">Mobile Applications</span>. You may also
                choose to download mobile applications offered by Kimberly-Clark. If you use our
                mobile applications, the mobile application may collect certain information automatically,
                such as the type of mobile device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device
                identifiers (sometimes called UDID) and information about the way you use the applications.
                The mobile application may also collect certain information you voluntarily provide,
                such as product information when you scan a bar code, and transactional information,
                such as when you make a purchase or respond to an offer. Our mobile applications
                may collect precise information about the location of your device, such as when
                you search for a store. However, you must first provide permission through your
                device before the application obtains such location information from technologies
                like GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity. Mobile service providers may collect device-specific
                information, such as a unique device identifier, when you use our Site or one of
                our mobile applications.
            </p>

            <h3 class="zeta">
                What We Do with Your Information</h3>
            <p>
                When you voluntarily sign up on this Site, we add your name, email address and street
                address to our mailing list. If you do not wish to receive these mailings, you may
                request to be removed from our mailing list by visiting this <a href="/unsubscribe.aspx">
                    page</a>, or by calling 1-888-525-8373. Additionally, if you decide that you
                do not want to receive commercial emails from us, you can “opt-out”
                from receiving such emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link provided
                at the bottom of every commercial email. Please note that if you choose to opt-out,
                we will still send you email relating to specific products or services that you
                purchase or sign up for, or email that we believe is pertinent to any communication
                that you have sent to us. If you decide at a later time that you would like to receive
                commercial emails from us, you can re-add yourself to our communication list. Our
                Site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we are conducting,
                and we may permit you to send your entry electronically in some cases. If that occurs,
                we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion
                (i.e., to contact you if you’re a winner).</p>
            <h3 class="zeta">
                How We Share Information</h3>
            <p>
                We may share information about you with third parties in certain circumstances including
                in the following situations:
            </p>
            
            <ul style="width: 95%">
                <li><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sharing Your Information With Partner Companies</span>.
                    We may ask your permission to share your information with carefully selected outside
                    companies when we believe their products or services may interest you. You may “opt
                    out” of partner offers and programs at any time by updating your <a href="/auth.sso?returnUrl=/kcsso/Profile.aspx">User Profile</a>, <a href="/legal/contact-us">contacting us</a>
                     or calling 1-800-665-9773 (on weekdays during 8 AM to 4 PM Central
                    Standard Time). Our partners are prohibited from using your contact information
                    for purposes other than presenting relevant offers and programs, and they are required
                    to maintain your contact information in confidence.</p></li>
                
                <li><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sharing Your Information with Service Providers</span>.
                    We may share information with companies or individuals that provide us with services.
                    These services may include, among other things, helping us to provide services that
                    you request, to create or maintain our databases, to research and analyze the people
                    who request products, services, or information from us, to prepare and distribute
                    communications, or to respond to inquiries.</p></li>
                
                <li><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Law Enforcement and Legal Process</span>.
                    We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe
                    to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation
                    into unlawful activity. In addition, we reserve the right to release your information
                    to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you
                    have violated our policies, or the release of your information may protect the rights,
                    property, or safety of Kimberly-Clark, or another person.</p></li>
                
                <li><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sharing Your Information as Permitted by
                    Law</span>. We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted
                    by, law. This may include sharing your information with government entities, or
                    third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as
                    we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims
                    that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that
                    we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.</p></li>
                
                <li><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Blogs, Online Postings, and Testimonials</span>.
                    We may decide to allow users to share comments, postings, testimonials, or other
                    information. If you choose to submit such information to us, the information that
                    you submit may be available generally to the public. Information that you provide
                    in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.</p> </li>
                
                <li><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Business Transaction</span>. In the event
                    that we, or any portion of our assets, are acquired or we undergo another transaction
                    in our business, your information may be transferred to the acquiring company or
                    other entity surviving such a transaction.</p></li>
                
                <li>  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Interest-Based Advertising</span>. Kimberly-Clark
                    participates in interest-based (on-line behavior) advertising. This means that a
                    third party may use technology, such as a cookie on your browser or a web beacon,
                    to identify you on our website so that they can provide advertising about products
                    and services tailored to your interest. You may see advertising on our website tailored
                    to how you browse or shop, or you may see advertising for Kimberly-Clark products
                    on other websites based on your browsing behavior across websites. Kimberly-Clark
                    voluntarily participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulation program.
                    As part of this self-regulation program, Kimberly-Clark supports deployment of the
                    Advertising Option icon (“Ad Choices”) in partnership with Evidon.</p></li>

                non-personal information with other third parties that are not described above.
                When we do so we may aggregate or de-identify the information so that a third party
                would not be likely to link data to you, your computer, or your device. Aggregation
                means that we combine the non-personal information of numerous people together so
                that the data does not relate to any one person. De-identify means that we attempt
                to remove or change certain pieces of information that might be used to link data
                to a particular person.
