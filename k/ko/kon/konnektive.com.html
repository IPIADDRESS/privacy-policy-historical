          </p>
<p>
          <strong>Requests for Information.</strong> If you provided your email address or phone number on the Sites to receive information from Konnektive, you agree that Konnektive, and our fulfillment partners may contact you using the contact information you provide us regarding our products and Services, such as offers, support and product updates. Konnektive and our fulfillment partners may make such contact by email, phone and/or text, including the phone number you provide us, and we may use automated dialers technology in order to more efficiently connect you with one of our representatives. Your mobile phone carrier’s standard message and data rates may apply to text messages. You are not required to provide your phone number as a condition of purchasing products or Services, and you can opt out at any time as described in the “Opting Out” section found below within this Policy.</p>
<p>
           <strong> Email.</strong> We may communicate with a customer through email using the customer’s personal contact information on file in our systems to inform the customer of new products, important industry news or information about Services and upgrades provided by Konnektive.<br>
            <strong>Disclosures to Third Parties – General.</strong> We may disclose information collected from a customer to our independent contractors and business partners who have agreed to (i) hold this information in confidence, and (ii) not use it for any purpose except to carry out the services they are providing for Konnektive. Such contractors and business partners include those hosting our Services or other data; managing the functionality of our Services; hosting customer relationship management, marketing automation, customer service and other software platforms on our behalf; processing credit or other payment card payments; collecting delinquent accounts; fulfilling and processing orders; delivering products you have ordered; conducting background checks if you submit an application for employment; assisting with marketing and promotions; and enabling us to send you email.<br>
          <strong>Disclosures to Third Parties – Specific.</strong> Konnektive has a number of partner programs designed to maximize our customers’ ability to use our Services and to purchase complementary products and services that may be used in tandem with our Services. We may disclose information collected from a customer to one or more trusted partners for the purpose of such partner(s) providing assistance to the customer in its use of the Services and for the purpose of marketing complementary or value-add products and services to the Customer. In each case such trusted partner will have agreed to (i) hold this information in confidence, and (ii) not use it for any purpose except for the purposes described above.</p>
<p>
          <strong>Disclosures of Aggregate Information.</strong> Konnektive may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from customers. Should a sale of Konnektive’s business ever occur, collected customer information may be transferred along with the sale but the information will be treated in the same manner as set forth in this Policy. In the event of any significant changes to the manner in which your information is handled, we would notify you by a prominent notice on the Sites, or by email.</p>
<p>
          <strong>Disclosures Made by You within Interactive Areas of a Site.</strong> If you use a bulletin board, blog, comment or discussion forum or chat room made available on a Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages, and could be potentially searchable through search engines. We are not responsible for the potential misuse by third parties of any personally identifiable information that you choose to submit in these various forums.</p>
<p></p><h3> Other General Policies Relating to Privacy,</h3>
<p>          <strong>Disclosures by Children.</strong> We believe that protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important and for that reason we will never collect or maintain information on our Site from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13.
          </p>
<p>
          <strong>Third Party Sites.</strong> Our Sites may contain links to third party websites. Please note that the privacy and other policies of any such third-party website may differ materially from this Policy. We strongly recommend that customers review the privacy policies of any such third party prior to submitting personally identifiable information. Konnektive has no control over and is not responsible for the information practices of other websites, including those to which we may link and those which may link to us.</p>
<p>
           <strong> Use of Widgets.</strong> We may provide widgets on our Sites that make it possible to share information on third-party platforms. These widgets do not store your personally identifiable information. Our Sites may also include social media features, such as the Facebook® or Twitter® button and similar widgets and interactive mini-programs that run on our site (each, a Feature). To the extent we use these Features, they may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social media Features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing the Feature or widget.</p>
<p>
          <strong>Use of Cookies.</strong> When you interact with the Site, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful. When you visit our Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that web browsers place on a computer’s hard drive and are used to indicate whether you have visited the Site previously. The data collected may include how you navigate around a web page and the most commonly clicked links on a specific web page. Certain technical information, such as your browser version and operating system, are also collected. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set (each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences). We use cookies for a number of purposes, including to: access a customer’s account information when a customer logs into a Site, so that we can provide the customer with customized content, keep track of preferences you specify while you are using the Services, and to estimate and report total audience size (unique users) and traffic for our Sites, and to conduct research to improve the content and services of our Sites.</p>
<p>
          <strong>Web Beacons.</strong> We may use web beacons (also known as clear GIFs) to access cookies and count users who visit our Sites or open our HTML-formatted email messages. Web beacons are single-pixel graphic files with a unique identifier, similar to cookies. Web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and emails and are stored on a user’s hard drive. You can modify your browser settings to control web beacons.</p>
