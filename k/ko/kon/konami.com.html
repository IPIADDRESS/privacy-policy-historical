                collection, use or disclosure of information by any third party, including without limitation social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+ or

              <p> Some jurisdictions also may require notice concerning personally identifiable information collected offline; for those jurisdictions, this Privacy Policy

              <p> Konami may collect information about you when you use the Online Services or our products or services, or when you otherwise provide personally
                identifiable information to us. For example, we may obtain personally identifiable information through: (1) "community" registration (e.g., registration
                for online games or tournaments, to participate in forums or chat rooms, to receive ongoing marketing or other information, etc.); (2) product
                registration; (3) email correspondence with product support/customer service; (4) polls or surveys; (5) E-Cards or "Send-to-a-Friend" emails; (6) the
                Konami Social Media Pages; (7) software applications that we make available through the Konami Social Media Pages and/or mobile services/application; (8)
                information submitted in a business capacity (e.g., resumes); and/or (9) information submitted as part of a promotion (e.g., online contests or
                sweepstakes). The types of information that may be requested for each activity and the way the information may be used are detailed below. </p>
              <p> § Community Registration </p>
              <p> If you choose to register on the Online Services, you will be required to provide your first and last name, city, state, zip code, country of residence,
                email address, date of birth, age, occupation and a user name and password. In addition, you may be asked to provide other information, such as your phone
                number, the provision of which is optional. The information that you submit during registration will: (a) make up your profile; (b) allow you to use our
                message board and participate in other activities on the Online Services (e.g., promotions or game-specific events); and (c) allow us to send you, via
                email, news about products, features and enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, and contents and events of interest. Please note that the
                information (e.g., email address, username, occupation, and interests) contained in your profile (i.e., that you provide when registering) may be viewable
                to other users of Konami's message board. We cannot and do not guarantee that this information will be kept confidential or private. If you choose, you may
                omit from your profile certain information that you do not want the public to see by leaving such information blank at the time of registration, or
                choosing to make your email address not accessible via such message boards. </p>
              <p> § Product Registration </p>
              <p> To register a Konami product on the Online Services, you will be required to submit your first and last name, city, state, zip code, country of residence,
                email address, date of birth, age and occupation. You may also be asked to provide your phone number and answer demographic questions relating to your age,
                information about the product you purchased, the type of console you own, and the types of games you enjoy playing. The information that you submit during
                product registration will entitle you to limited warranty protection and technical support. Unless you opt out at the time of registration, we may also use
                your registration information to send you, via email, news about products, features and enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, and contents
                and events of interest. You may also choose to opt out at any time from receiving these messages, as described below. </p>
              <p> § Customer Support </p>
              <p> Konami may collect, use and store personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to us via email or other means when contacting Konami
                customer service or support. For example, we may provide on the Online Services a link through which an online visitor can send e-mail to customer service
                addressing any issue a user encounters with a Konami product. Your email address and any personally identifiable information you choose to provide in the
                body of such email is used by Konami for purposes of addressing and responding to your question. Although most e-mail messages are deleted immediately
                after they are responded to, in certain cases, hard copies or data from certain e-mail correspondence may be kept on file for security or other business
                purposes, and even deleted emails may remain archived or in system backups. Any such copy or data will be stored in a secure location, and information from
                these messages will not be used for marketing purposes. Our policy is not to retain any email addresses collected from you during the use of the E-Cards or
                "Send-to-a-Friend" email feature on any Online Services, as these email addresses are only intended to be used to send a one-time email notification on
                your behalf. </p>
              <p> § Polls/Surveys </p>
              <p> From time to time, we may ask you for your opinion about certain matters in the form of online or offline polls or surveys, including your opinion with
                respect to our games or other products and services. Your responses to these polls help us provide products and services of interest to you. While we may
                ask for certain demographic or other information in connection with such polls or surveys to allow us to better interpret the results, we do not request
                personally identifiable information, such as your name, in connection with these polls or surveys. </p>
              <p> § Konami Social Media Pages </p>
              <p> You do not have to provide personally identifiable information to use the Konami Social Media Pages. However, in order for you to take advantage of
                particular opportunities provided through the Konami Social Media Pages (for example, promotions, events, games or other applications), we may require that
                you furnish personally identifiable information. We and our third-party service providers collect such information from you through the Konami Social Media
                Pages, including your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, Facebook and other social media IDs and the names of your friends, only when
                voluntarily provided to us (either directly or indirectly as a result of Facebook or other social media site being authorized to submit such information to
                us). Such information may be used and disclosed for any purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy. Konami also collects other information (such as your
                gender, social media networks, workplace, geographic location, application settings and statistics, status updates, user interactions and other
                non-personally identifiable information) when you voluntarily provide such information to us (either directly or indirectly as a result of Facebook or
                other social media Online Services being authorized to submit such information to us). Unless otherwise noted, we may share, use and disclose such
                information for any purpose in our discretion. </p>
              <p> § Promotions </p>
              <p> From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to enter into Konami-sponsored promotions, such as contests or sweepstakes. We may offer these
                promotions through our Online Services or in-person. To participate in a promotion, you may be required to submit information, such as your first and last
                name, city, state, zip code, country of residence, email address, date of birth, and age, so that we (or our partners) can administer the promotion. For
                example, we (or our partners) may use this information to determine whether you are eligible to participate in the promotion and/or to notify you in the
                event you are selected as a winner. </p>
              <p> § Mobile Services and Applications </p>
              <p> Certain of our mobile services and/or applications may require that you furnish personally identifiable information by downloading the application to your
                mobile device. We and third-party service providers collect such information from you through your mobile device, including your name, user name, profile
                pictures, telephone number, device identifiers, e-mail address, contacts, GPS location, browser history, chat or messaging activity, application linked
                friends and Apple Game Center ID. Certain collection of information may be disabled or limited in specific applications in the user settings. Such
                information may be used and disclosed for any purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy. Konami also collects other non-personally identifiable
                information. Unless otherwise noted, we may share, use and disclose such non-personally identifiable information for any purpose in our discretion. </p>
              <p> § Candidates for Employment </p>
              <p> Konami may provide on the Online Services an email address that visitors can use to send us their resumes. In the future we may expand functionality on the
                Online Services for other similar business uses. We also may collect personally identifiable information offline about candidates for employment.
                Personally identifiable information about candidates will be used for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings and
                may therefore be shared within our company. If the candidate becomes an employee, this information also may be used and retained for employment purposes.
                Other than as explained in this paragraph, this Privacy Policy does not apply to personally identifiable information gathered concerning job applicants or
                candidates for employment. </p>
              <p> § Passive Collection </p>
              <p> As noted below, (see "Does Konami use cookie, track IP addresses or use other passive means to collect information?"), we use certain passive means to
                collect information regarding visitors to the Online Services, Online Services traffic patterns and Online Services usage. Unless noted otherwise, we may
                share, use and disclose such information, as well as aggregated information or other non-personal information, for any purpose in our discretion. </p>
              <p> § Other Uses of Personally Identifiable Information </p>
              <p> We may also use your personally identifiable and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve
                the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. From time to time, we are approached by third-party companies and organizations
                that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. To extend these products or services to you, we may use your personally
                identifiable information to send out notices on their behalf. We strive to limit the notices and communications to those that we think you would appreciate
                receiving. </p>
              <p> Your personally identifiable information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and
                by using the Online Services, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your country of residence, including the United States, which
                may have different data protection rules than in your country. </p>
              <p> <strong> No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we seek only to collect the information that we believe
                is reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. </strong> </p>

              <p> <strong>What happens if I refuse to provide my personally identifiable information to Konami? </strong> </p>
              <p> If you choose not to submit personally identifiable information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on the Online
                Services which may considerably limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to provide your email address when registering, you will
                not be able to use our message boards. </p>

              <p> <a name="0.1_cookies"></a> <strong>Does Konami use cookies, track IP addresses or use other passive means to collect information?</strong> </p>
              <p> Cookies </p>
              <p> Konami may collect information through cookies to improve the use of the Online Services. A "cookie" is a small string of text sent by the Online Services
                to your browser and then stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy and convenient method for
                us to personalize and enhance your experience on the Online Services, and to help us diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Online
                Services. For example, cookies allow us to remember your screen name and date of birth, tell us that you have visited the Online Services before, track
                your usage of the Online Services, and may contain information that will make your next visit to the Online Services more enjoyable. In addition, Konami
                will not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies,
                but you can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. However, rejecting cookies may prevent
                you from taking advantage of certain portions of the Online Services. </p>
              <p> Third Party Cookies </p>
              <p> We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing
                company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use the Online Services. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies
                provided by our marketing company on the Online Services. We may collect the following types of information through such third party cookies: the activity
                of the Online Services' visitors' browsers when the visitors are viewing the Online Services; the website path of visitors; the time visitors come to the
                Online Services; and product codes and pricing information for merchandise that visitors purchase via the Online Services. By supplementing our records,
                this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what
                kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from the Online Services on our behalf, we control
                how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve the Online Services and our products, offers and marketing
                strategy, you can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by emailing

              <p> IP Addresses </p>
              <p> While you are browsing the Online Services, Konami automatically collects your IP address and your activity while using the Online Services. An IP address
                is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. </p>
              <p> Log Files </p>
              <p> Konami also collects information in the form of log files that record activity on the Online Services, including how many "hits" a particular web page is
                getting (a.k.a. "click-through data"). For example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks an image on the Online Services. These
                entries enable Konami to assess overall site activity, track interest in particular portions of the Online Services, troubleshoot technical concerns, and
                identify the type of browser you are using. We may also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly
                improve the products and services we provide you. Log files are used internally only. </p>

              <p> Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our
                disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. Currently, Konami does not disclose personally
                identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. </p>

              <p> <strong>What safeguards does Konami use to protect my personally identifiable information?</strong> </p>
              <p> Konami maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the personally identifiable information we collect from our
                users. Personally identifiable information collected by Konami is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and is only
                accessible by authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control
                (i.e., maintain data quality). Before we allow users of the Online Services to access their personally identifiable information, for example, we verify
                their identity by prompting them to submit information such as their login name and password. </p>
              <p> Nonetheless, please be aware that Internet data transmission is not always secure and we cannot warrant or guarantee that information you transmit
                utilizing the Online Services is secure. Because security is important to both Konami and you, we will always make reasonable efforts to ensure the
                security of our systems. </p>
