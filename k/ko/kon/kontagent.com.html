        <h1 style="color:white;">Upsight Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="large-12 columns content-box block-content">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: March 17, 2014</strong><br>
This privacy policy (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Policy</span>“) explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Upsight, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upsight</span>“, “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">we</span>” or “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">us</span>“), when you access the Upsight web site at www.Upsight.com (the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Site</span>“) or interact with the Upsight analytics and marketing platform (the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upsight Platform</span>“). The Upsight Platform provides tools to application providers (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Publishers</span>”) to enable them to better understand and communicate with the users of their mobile applications (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Applications</span>”) and to serve advertisements (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ads</span>“) through their Applications from advertisers that are part of the Upsight ad network or other third-party ad networks (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertisers</span>“). The Site, Upsight Platform, and the serving of Ads are collectively referred to as the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Services</span>.” If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, you must terminate your use of the Services.</p>
<p><i>We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by posting the revised policy to the Site. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. Changes will become effective as of the Effective Date listed at the top of this Policy. We</i> <i>encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</i> <i>Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this Policy will indicate your acceptance of those changes.</i></p>
<p>This Policy is subject to the provisions of Upsight’s Terms of Service, which are fully incorporated herein by reference. To review the Terms of Service, please <a title="Terms of Service" href="../terms-of-service/">click here</a>.</p>
<p><b>What Is Personal Information?<br>
</b>As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card number), or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Services or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
<p><b>What Information Do We Collect?<br>
</b>We may collect information in a number of ways when you use the Services:</p>
<p><b>Active Collection.<br>
</b>We collect certain information when you voluntarily provide it, such as if you send us an email, fill out a form, post comments or other content, or otherwise provide or request information. This may include when you voluntarily provide information to Upsight in response to an in-app communication from a Publisher using the Upsight Platform. Such information may include personal information, such as your name, user name, email, address, telephone number, and other contact and demographic information you choose to provide. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user, or participating in any interactive forums or features on the Services. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact, or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Services.</p>
<p>Our Site offers social media features, including a connection to Facebook’s invites, notifications, feeds, like button, and other user-to-user interaction data, that may collect your IP address, page view information from your use on the Site, and&nbsp;may set cookies to enable the features to function properly. These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p><b>Passive Collection.<br>
</b>When you use the Services, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">IP</span>”) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, your activity on the Site, and custom event and monetization data. When you view an Ad while accessing or using an Application, we may automatically collect your device type and IP address as well as a device ID for your mobile device. We also may collect information about your use and activity on the Application and the Upsight Platform. Your IP address may be used to determine the location of your use. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above.</p>
<p>Information provided by device ID’s may be used, among other things, to analyze data, to determine the popularity of certain content, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests, to make recommendations to you, to better understand the usage and visitation of the Services and the effectiveness of communications, to provide dashboard metrics and insights, and to benchmark information for select plans.</p>
<p>For some features of the Services, you may be able to submit information about other people. For instance, if you wish to send a coupon or advertisement to a friend you may submit some of your friend’s personal information. Upsight will use any such information that we collect from you about another person to carry out your request. We may also share such information with Advertisers for them to carry out your request.</p>
<p><b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</b><b>.<br>
</b>We use cookies and scripts on the Site and Platform to assist us with functionality and to help us understand how users interact with the Site and Platform. Third parties, with whom we partner, may use these technologies as well as web beacons to assist us in gathering this analytical information.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.&nbsp; A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. You may find additional instruction on how to delete cookies by <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/DEFAULT.ASPX?page=2 ">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>
<p>In addition, our third party partners may use Flash Local Storage Objects (also known as Flash cookies) to assist in the display of videos on the Site. To manage Flash LSOs please <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html ">click here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Applications and Ads</b><b>.<br>
</b>We may use web beacons or HTML 5 Local Storage Objects as part of our passive collection of information from Applications or Ads.</p>
<p>Cookies, web beacons, or other devices may be used by our [partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers] to collect information when you use the Applications or interact with the Ads. In addition, our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers may use session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site or the Applications.&nbsp; Upsight does not control any cookies or other data collection tools that may be placed in Ads or Applications by a third party, including Publishers or Advertisers, and this Policy does not cover the use of such cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such third parties to find out more about the information that may be collected by them and the choices you have regarding the collection, use and sharing of such information.</p>
<p><b>Information Received From Third Parties.<br>
</b>We may also obtain certain non-personal information about you from third parties, including our Publishers or Advertisers. This information may include demographic, geographic, psychographic and other usage information that does not personally identify an individual user and may be associated with a device ID. The collection and use of this information is pursuant to such third party’s information collection practices, which are typically outlined in a privacy policy like this one, provided on the third party’s website or in the Application. This Policy does not apply to information received from third parties, and Upsight is not responsible for the privacy and security practices and policies of such third parties.</p>
<p><b>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?<br>

<li>with Advertisers to send you coupons, promotions, rewards, awards, and advertisements you request;</li>

<li>when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Upsight, our users, our employees, our Publishers and Advertisers, copyright owners, third parties or the public, including without limitation to protect Upsight or our users, Publishers or Advertisers from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate, or unlawful use of the Site and the Upsight Platform;</li>

We recommend you be cautious about giving out personal information to others or sharing personal information in public or private online forums. To request removal of your personal information from publicly available areas that we control, such as our blog, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy-info@upsight.com">privacy-info@upsight.com</a>.&nbsp; In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for the actions of Publishers, Advertisers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to any third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to any such parties.</p>
