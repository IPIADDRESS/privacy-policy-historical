<p>Although we may collect certain
information from you as discussed below, please be reassured in knowing the
following:</p>

<p></p><li>we do not use any information about where you personally go on our Site, nor do we give such
information out to third parties;<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>we do not give out your
name, telephone number, credit card or other personal information, unless you
(or, if you are a child under the age of 13, your parent) authorize us to do so
or except where needed to deliver a product or service you ordered;<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>unless you are an adult
and you personally divulge personal information, we will not give out
information that would link your profile, user ID,
or nickname with your actual name without your (or, if you are a child under
the age of 13, your parent's) prior consent; and<p></p>

<p></p></li></font><li><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">we will always give you
(or your parent) the opportunity to access and correct your personal contact
and billing information at any time.<p></p>

<p><i>Personal Information that You Give Us</i></p>

<p>There are various areas on our Site where we either require or permit you to transfer personal
information voluntarily. We use this personal information
only for the specific purpose specified at the time you input such information.
In addition, we never divulge such information to third parties without your
consent. These areas include:</p>

<p><em><a href="http://connectedteacher.classroom.com/registration/register/info.asp?sn=TCM-1010-10-128263&amp;from=register">
Teacher Registration</a></em>. Registering
with Classroom Connect affords you the ability to receive enhanced services and
functionality of our Site. In order to become a registered member of Classroom Connect, we ask you for
your first and last name, job title, email address, whether or not you have an
affiliation with a school, the zip code of that school, and whether or not
you'd like to receive Classroom Connect email and
email newsletters. This
registration is meant for teachers, administrators, and interested parents and
is not intended for children or K-12 students.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://connectedteacher.classroom.com/teacherContact/search.asp">Teacher Search</a></i>.<a name="teacherSearch">&nbsp;</a>
In order to become a part of our Teacher Search database we require you to first and
foremost be a teacher and be registered with our site as described above. We also ask that you provide us with certain
personal information by checking boxes regarding curriculum, grades taught, and interests
as well as provide a Web address for any home page you might wish to provide
and/or a personal statement. This
information will be shared entirely on a voluntary basis and is intended to be
a way for teachers to introduce themselves to our community. Since it is our policy not to
divulge email addresses to third parties, and in order to ensure our teacher’s
safety, all emails sent to Teacher Search members must go through our server
and then will be forwarded by us to the intended recipient. Shortly thereafter, the recipient will see
the email address of the sender and will have the option of responding. The header of such email will notify the
recipient that the contact was made through the Teacher Search database.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://connectedteacher.classroom.com/listServ/subscribe.asp">Email List
Sign-Up</a></i> We offer teachers the opportunity to receive a variety of informative emails by
giving us their names and email addresses in order to subscribe to
those email lists which they desire. At any time the teacher may <a href="http://connectedteacher.classroom.com/listServ/unsubscribe.asp">unsubscribe</a>
from such mailing lists. Once again,
this information (name and email address) is
not shared with any third parties.  Beyond
the Email List Sign-Up, there may be other times we request or acquire your
email address, such
as when you send us an email with questions or comments. We will only use your
address to respond to emails from you, forward and send your emails to and from
other registered users and internal Classroom Connect
employees who may be able to respond to you, send information to you
concerning your account, and inform you of updates to our Web
site if you have opted-in for such notification. Classroom Connect DOES NOT share email
addresses or any other personal information about our registered users with advertisers,
business partners, sponsors or other third parties without your consent. Our
email lists are not intended for children.</p>

<p><i>Message Boards and Postings.</i> We offer message boards and other similar
posting opportunities. Please see our <a href="http://www.classroom.com/general/copyright/termuse.asp">Terms of Use</a>
before using such boards and/or postings and make sure to post only information
that you are comfortable sharing. Presently, we have separate boards for K-12 students and teachers. All posts to Classroom Connect’s boards are
first reviewed by us (except for in Connected University which is oriented
towards teachers, parents, and administrators and subject to an additional CU
Terms of Use) before allowing any actual posting in order to ensure compliance
with our Terms of Use. In addition, in
order to make our student boards safe and enjoyable it is our general policy
not to allow our students to post identifiable personal information. We therefore make every effort to remove,
edit or restrict all such posting from these student-oriented boards.</p>

<p><i>Galleries.</i> We offer students the ability
to post their classroom projects to our Site in the forms of text, graphic,
html, and/or sound files. Please see
our <a href="http://www.classroom.com/general/copyright/termuse.asp">Terms of Use</a>
which provides for certain restrictions and licenses before using or allowing
K-12 students or children to post to these galleries. As with the message boards, it is our general policy not to allow
K-12 students to post identifiable personal information: for this reason, we
first review the intended posts before allowing any actual posting. If intended postings are transmitted with
such personal information or contain a picture of the student with the project, we require
prior parental consent through a postal mailed or
faxed form <!--add link to form-->before we will post such
information to a gallery.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://store.classroom.com/browse/default.asp">Online Store</a>.</i> 
Classroom Connect offers our members the opportunity to buy products from our Online
Store. Like other retailers and direct
marketers, we record information about such purchases. When you buy from us online, our system
automatically gathers purchase data, and we also record information about
purchases made through our telemarketing, mail order and other marketing
operations. We may review what kinds of
products and services appeal most to our members as a group. This statistical
information helps us improve our offerings in the same way that other companies
change their catalog based on what sells best. We give you the option to choose between online and offline purchase
options. Product ordering is only intended to be by teachers, administrators and interested parents and is
not intended for children or K-12 students.</p>

<p><u>If you choose to order offline,</u> we first require you to
submit online your zip or postal code and U.S. state (if applicable) so
that we can calculate your sales tax and shipping and handling. Then, we ask that you print out an
order form which requests payment information
including credit card and expiration date, purchase order, checking account, as
well as billing and shipping information which includes name, title, school
name, address, email and phone number.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This information is only used for the purpose of consummating your
purchase.</p>

<p><u>If you order online,</u> we require your billing information exactly as it
appears on your credit card statement so that we can process your order
including name, address, phone number and e-mail. Email is required so that we can send you a confirmation of your
order. Once again, the information you
provide us is used solely for the purpose of consummating your purchase.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://cu.classroom.com/Enroll/Agree.asp">Connected
University Registration.</a></i> Connected University (CU) hosts open-enrollment classes on technology and education.
You may <a href="http://cu.classroom.com/logon.asp">enroll</a> in as many courses as you desire during a term. Enrollment for 
CU is completely optional and at your discretion. CU message boards
and courses, open only to registered members, are monitored but not moderated. Members
of Connected University may post information, projects,
and other information on this portion of the Site. Connected University may
include, and other users may provide, links to other Web sites or resources. We cannot guarantee your privacy on such other Web
sites and do not have control over their privacy policies or content. Please see our <a href="http://cu.classroom.com/Enroll/Agree.asp">Terms of Use</a> specific to
Connected University regarding responsibility of posts transmitted by you or
for any such information posted by any other user of Connected University or
(ii) the conduct of any other users in their use of Connected University.</p>

<p><i>Information that We Independently Derive From Your Use of Our
Site</i></p>

<p>Aside from any information
you may actively disclose to us, there is other, less obvious, information
which we might gain from you. Generally, we use such information for internal purposes such as to
improve the content of our Web pages and/or customize the layout of our pages
for each individual visitor according to their preferences. In addition, we keep records in your account
history of your complaints about other members’ online behavior, your contact
with Classroom Connect and any reported violations of our Terms of Use that you
or someone on your account may have committed.</p>

<p><i><u>Computer Information</u></i>. We
automatically query your computer for information about your computer system
such as the speed of your modem, error messages you may have received, or 
operating system type -- to help us fit our services to your individual needs
and to help us diagnose problems you may be having with your system. We use an
identifier in the form of a user ID to give you access to subscription or premium areas.</p>

<p><i><u>Geographic Location</u></i>. We sometimes use information about your geographical
location to provide localized service. By knowing where your computer is located, 
we can provide faster service by sending your server localized content. Also, we may
use your zip code or  time zone  to make sure certain information
you see is accurate for you.</p>

<p><i><u>Aggregate Information</u></i>. Finally,
our system automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on our
Site. We use this navigational information in the aggregate to understand how our members 
(be they teachers or K-12 students) as a group use the service so that we can make our Site better.
We may also share this aggregate statistical information with our partners or other outside companies, but in doing so, we
never disclose individual names or personal navigational information. Some examples of how we aggregate such
information are as follows:</p>

<a name="cookies">
<p><u><i>Cookies.</i></u> Cookies are pieces of information that our Web Site
transfers to your computer’s hard drive in order to make your experience on our
Site more efficient. Cookies allow us
to customize the information we provide according to your preferences and/or
user profile. Cookies are widely used
on the Internet and have become an industry standard. Although a cookie cannot, in and of itself, identify you, it can
identify your computer. Your browser is
most likely set up to accept cookies automatically. If you’d like to disable this feature you may do so by adjusting
the options or preferences in your browser. However, by doing so, you will lose some of the functionality of
Classroom Connect’s Web pages such as gaining access to any of the subscription Internet products you have purchased from
our Online Store, and losing ability for personalization. This is because we use cookies to enable user registration and login and
personalization, as well as in conjunction with our Online Store to keep
track of your shopping cart and record billing and shipping address. Cookies used in the Online Store will expire
generally after two weeks. We use cookies to
keep track of your user session and click stream data, as well as to
to tailor web content to your interests and/or to personalize our Site (e.g.
your name automatically appears on our Site).</p>

<p><u><i>IP Addresses</i></u>. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer
whenever you begin service with an Internet Service Provider. Classroom
Connect collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to
audit the use of our Site. Each time
you log onto our Site and each time you request one of our pages, our server
logs your IP address. Although we log
your session with us, we will not normally link your IP address to anything
that can enable us to identify you. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we
feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service
or to protect our service, Site, users or others.</p>

<p>Classroom Connect may require other information for tracking and/or verifying compliance
with Classroom Connect policies, fulfilling any prizes or promotions we may
offer, as well as abiding by federal, state and local laws, and/or for editorial and
feedback solicitation purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may use your information for new, unanticipated
uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices materially change at some time in
the future, we will contact you (or post such change to the Site) before we use
your data for these new purposes. At
that time we would notify you of the policy change and provide you with the
ability to opt-in or opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, 
please periodically check our Site, especially this privacy policy.</p>

<p><b>POLICIES FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE)</b></p>

</a><p><a name="cookies">We understand that our
student users who are under 13 years of age need special safeguards and privacy
protection and it is our intent to fully comply with the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act. In addition, we
realize that children may not understand all the provisions of our policy or be
able to make thoughtful decisions about the choices available to adult
members. For this reason, we have
special privacy policies to protect students and children using areas on the
service specifically designed for them. However, we urge all parents, teachers and classroom administrators to
teach their children and/or students about protecting their personal
information while online. A good starting point for learning about children’s
privacy online is the </a><a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/" target="_new">U.S. Federal
Trade Commission’s privacy section.</a> It is important to understand
that only certain portions of our site are intended for or directed at children
under the age of 13 years old. No personal information in these or any other areas should be submitted to, or
posted by, students under 13 years of age without the consent and guidance of
their parent or guardian.</p>

<p><strong>We have agreed that when attempting to collect or use
personally identifiable information from children under 13, we will:</strong></p>

<p>1. Get parental consent (for example, by sending in a permission form
by regular mail or by fax, or by email where permitted by COPPA regulations in
effect April 21, 2000) before collecting, using, or distributing to third
parties a child’s name, address, school, telephone numbers or other personally
identifiable information or third party personally identifiable information
from children under 13. We will not share children’s
information with third parties.</p>

<p>2. Get
parental consent before giving the child access to services that allow the
child to publicly post or distribute personally identifiable information or
third party personally identifiable information (with the exception of <a href="http://www.classroomtoday.com/StudentCenter/postcards/choosePostCardGroup.asp">Epostcards</a>).</p>

<p>3. Use
online contact information for the child (such as an email address) a) only
once to respond to a specific request from the child; b) in order to request
the name or online contact information of a parent in order to get parental
consent or provide parental notification; and c) to respond more than once
directly to a specific request from the child and not to recontact the child
beyond the scope of that request. When
the information is used to contact the child more than once, reasonable efforts
will be taken to provide parental notification.</p>

<p>4. Not entice a child or student by offering a special game, prize, or other activity
to give more information than is needed to participate in that activity.</p>

<p>5. Provide
the child's or student's parent, upon request, with a) a description of the
specific types of personally identifiable information or third party personally
identifiable information collected from the child or student and allow the parent
to refuse further use or future online collection of personally identifiable
information or third party personally identifiable information from the child
or student; and b) a means that is reasonable under the circumstances for the
parent to obtain any personally identifiable information or third party
personally identifiable Information collected from the child.</p>

<p>6. Provide
prominent notice to the child describing what personally identifiable
information or third party personally identifiable information will be
collected, and explain the need for the child to get parental consent before
giving information.</p>

<p>7. Maintain reasonable security procedures to protect the child’s personally identifiable
information or third party personally identifiable information collected
through the site from the child. We do not currently
collect personally identifiable information from children.</p>

<p>9. No student registration is currently available.</p>

<p>10. Ensure that no information collected from guests under 13 years of age is knowingly
used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or
outside Classroom Connect except as explicitly stated during registration for
contests or promotions (and in that case, the information collected is used
only for the specific contest or promotion). In addition, although guests under 13 years of age may be allowed to
participate in some contests and promotions, if such a guest wins, notification
and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial
registration process. Publication of

<p>Unsolicited email is a problem for everyone, but it
is particularly a problem for children. This includes mail that could contain content you may not want your
children to see, or mail that may ask for information you would not want your
children to give out. In this regard,
Classroom Connect is currently monitoring all the boards and posts made on its
Site. If Classroom Connect believes, in
its opinion, that the subject matter is inappropriate we will refrain from
posting the message on Site, or we may simply remove all personally
identifiable information.</p>

<p>If you have more questions or concerns
about how to safeguard children's privacy, there is a lot of great information
on the Federal Trade Commission's site -- in particular,  the
Traveling with Children section in their article on <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee/index.html" target="_new">Site Seeing on
the Internet</a>.</p>

<p><b>SECURITY</b></p>

<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration
of the information under our control. Classroom.com is protected by industry
standard “secure socket layer” (SSL) technology. You can see this technology at
work at critical parts of the site, such as when you fill in an online order
form at our online store <a href="http://store.classroom.com">http://store.classroom.com</a>. SSL is evident in the
image of a lock shown usually at the bottom of your screen. Our database server
has a backup system to prevent loss of data. Only Classroom Connect staff are
allowed to access or alter any information stored at Classroom Connect. This
website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.&nbsp; When
users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is
protected both online and off-line.</p>
<p>
When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit
card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and
is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.&nbsp;
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of
Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes
locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.&nbsp; To
learn more about SSL, follow this link:
<a href="http://store.classroom.com/help/security_info.asp">http://store.classroom.com/help/security_info.asp</a></p>

<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do
everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. Our company
regularly updates employees on privacy issues via email and verbal
announcements. Only authorized employees have access to sensitive information
online. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific for
example, Client Interaction, have access to customers' personally identifiable
information. </p>

<p>To help protect your account, please keep your password secure. We suggest that you pick a
non-obvious password and one that mixes numbers and letters.&nbsp; In addition,
we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Classroom Connect
will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.
Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and
any account information.</p>

<p>Remember to log out of your
Classroom Connect registered user account and close your browser window
whenever you leave your computer. This is to ensure that others cannot access
your personal information and correspondence, because your computer may be
accessible to others or used in a shared setting such as a school computer lab,
library or Internet café.</p>
