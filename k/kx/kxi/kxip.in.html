<p>We may use  Personal Information and other information received and collected from you to  provide the services you may have requested including creation of a publicly  accessible profile on our fan club, services that display customised content to  you and to contact you upon your request and when otherwise necessary. We may also use Personal Information for  auditing, research and analysis, and to operate and improve our services. In some circumstances, we may share  aggregated non-personal information with third parties. When we use third parties to assist us in  processing your Personal Information, we require that they comply with our  Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

<h3>Confidentiality  and Security</h3>
<p>We will keep  confidential and protect your Personal Information except where disclosure is  required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>We follow  generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information  submitted to us, both during transmission and, once we receive it, for storage  and disposal. When you enter sensitive  information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information  using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  All information we gather is securely stored within databases controlled  by us. The databases are stored on  servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected  and is strictly limited. No method of  transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%  secure, however.

We do not intend to transfer  Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to  act on our behalf unless such transfer is legally required.

<p>If you click on a  link to a third party site or otherwise leave the KXIP website you will go to a  website that is outside our control.  Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot  accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Information by such third parties,  and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security  practices as we do. We encourage you to  review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request  services. If you visit a third party  website that is linked to our website, you should consult that website’s  privacy policy before providing any Personal Information.</p>
<h3>Contacting  You</h3>
<p>We may contact you  using the Personal Information you have given us:</p>
<ul>
<li>in relation to the functioning of any service you have signed  up for in order to ensure that we can deliver the services to you;</li>
<li>where you have opted to receive further correspondence;</li>
<li>to invite you to participate in fan contests or surveys about  the team or related matters (participation is always voluntary); and</li>

<p>To the extent that  you do provide us with Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate and  current Personal Information. Where we  collect Personal Information from you on our website, should you need to update  or correct that Personal Information, please contact us and we will make  reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that  we hold as soon as practicable.</p>
