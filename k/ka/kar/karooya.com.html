                <strong>Sources of Marketing Data.</strong> The bulk of the information we collect and use for marketing purposes
                relates to individuals; employees or authorised agents of our clients and other companies with 
                which we have an existing business relationship. We may also obtain contact information from 
                public sources, including content made public at social media websites, to make an initial contact 
                with a relevant individual or company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Targeted E-mail.</strong> We send commercial e-mail to individuals; employees or authorised agents of our
                client or other companies with whom we want to develop or maintain a business relationship. Our 
                targeted e-mail messages typically include web beacons, cookies, and similar technologies that allow 
                us to know whether you open, read, or delete the message, and links you may click. When you click 
                a link in a marketing e-mail you receive from KAROOYA, we will also use a cookie to log what pages 
                you view and what content you download from our websites, even if you are not registered at or 
                signed into our site.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Combining Data from Multiple Sources.</strong> As described above, we may combine data from publicly
                available sources, and from our e-mail, website, and personal interactions with you. We combine 
                this data to better understand your needs, to assess the suitability of our service offerings for your 
                needs, and to perform the other activities described throughout this Privacy Policy.
