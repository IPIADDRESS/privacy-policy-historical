      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Protecting your privacy on our web site</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    </p><h3>
    What this privacy policy covers
    </h3>
  <p></p>
  
  <p>
    This privacy policy pertains to the use of the Kareo web site at 
    <a href="http://www.kareo.com/">http://www.kareo.com/</a>.  This privacy policy covers how Kareo 
    treats personal information that Kareo collects and  receives. Personal information is information 
    about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address or phone number.	
    Children under 13 are not permitted to use the Kareo service, and so this privacy  policy makes 
    no provision for children's use of the site.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kareo is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, organization whose 
    mission is to build userâ€™s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair 
    information practices.  Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, 
    it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for 
    compliance by TRUSTe.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Kareo by 
    emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@kareo.com">privacy@kareo.com</a>.   If you do not receive acknowledgement 
    of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact 
    TRUSTe at <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=www.kareo.com">
    http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=www.kareo.com</a>.  TRUSTe will then 
    serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.
  </p>

  <p>
    The TRUSTe program only covers information that is collected through this web site, and does 
    not cover information that may be collected through any software downloaded from this web site.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    </p><h3>
    Information collection and how it is used
    </h3>
  <p></p>
  
  <p>
    <b>General Information</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not have to give us any personal information to visit the product information portion of our web site.
    No personally identifying information (such as your name, e-mail address or Social Security number) will be
    collected unless you choose to provide that information to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kareo collects personal information when you sign up for a trial or paid subscription to the Kareo service.
    When you sign up, we ask for your name, email address, phone number and your company's demographic and financial
    information.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you sign up for a paid subscription, we will ask you to enter your credit card or ACH information.
    This information is encrypted on computer systems that are secured in a locked cage at a data center co-location 
    facility rented by Kareo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kareo automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address
    and the page you request.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kareo uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification
    and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kareo will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  
    For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
    Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not 
    wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to
    you.  Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe by clicking on the link within the email.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>IP Addresses</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page or use our service. Your IP
    address is not permanently stored in a way that is identified with your personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:
  </p>
  <p>
    To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP
    addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.
  </p>
  <p>
    To estimate the total number of users visiting Kareo from specific geographical regions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Cookies</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is
    sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Kareo
    uses a "session" cookie that will get removed automatically when you close your web browser.
    We have cookies on our site but the data is only collected in the aggregate. We use a third-party 
    tracking services that uses cookies and other tracking technologies to track non-personally 
    identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third parties also place browser plug-in cookies on our site, including Flash cookies, also known 
    as "local shared objects," to perform similar functions as browser cookies. Like normal browser 
    cookies, these cookies are represented as small files stored on your computer. One method of 
    preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website 
    Privacy Settings Panel at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">macromedia.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Protected Health Information</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    When using the web site, you will never provide Kareo with Protected Health Information (PHI),
    nor will Kareo show any PHI.
  </p>

  <p>
    </p><h3>
    Information sharing and disclosure
    </h3>
  <p></p>
  
  <p>
    Kareo may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances,
    such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Kareo Terms of Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kareo may share demographic information with business partners, such as "7% of Kareo customers
    are in the Los Angeles region" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be
    used without your permission (i.e., we will ask you before using a quote or testimonial). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Third party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites on the Internet.  Third party vendors, 
    including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website.  
    Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the 
    <a target="new" href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google advertising opt-out page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kareo does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated
    companies for promotional purposes except to provide products or services you've requested or when 
    we have your permission.
  </p>
  <p>
    With your consent, we do share your name and email with carefully selected partners. If you would 
    not like your information shared with these partners, uncheck the box when asked this option or 
    notify us via <a href="privacy@kareo.com">privacy@kareo.com</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
    illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety
    of any person, violations of Kareo's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will transfer information about you if Kareo is acquired by or merged with another company. In
    this event, Kareo will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Kareo web site
    before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use other third parties such as a chat service provider to provide customer service to you, and a 
    credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, an email service provider to 
    send out emails on our behalf.  When you sign up for these services, we will specify what 
    personally identifiable information is being shared as necessary for the third party to provide 
    that service.
  </p>

  <p>
    </p><h3>
      Accessing, updating, or correcting your personal information
    </h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, 
    you may correct it by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.
  </p>

  <p>
    </p><h3>
      Security
    </h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information 
    such as credit card number on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using 
    secure socket layer technology (SSL).
  </p>
  <p>
    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information 
    submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over 
    the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive 
    to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its 
    absolute security.
  </p>



  <p>
    </p><h3>
      Customer testimonials, comments and reviews
    </h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    We post customer testimonials, comments and reviews on our web site which may contain personal 
    information.  These testimonials are publicly available from a partner site and we post them on 
    our policy.   We do obtain the customer's consent to post their name along with their testimonial 
    via email prior to posting the testimonial.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should be aware that any personal information you submit on blogs on this site and others 
    can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you 
    unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to 
    submit in these forums.
  </p>


  <p>
    </p><h3>
      Links to other sites
    </h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave this site and go to the site you selected. 
    Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for 
    any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee 
    that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as us. We encourage you to review the privacy 
    statements of any other service provider from whom you request services.
  </p>

    how we handle personal information we will send a notice to the contact email address specified
    in your company's Kareo account or by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our site.
