                        is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information 
                        we collect about you to process orders and to improve 
                        our ability to serve your needs. This privacy policy applies 
                        only to Kagi and not product suppliers outside of Kagi 
                        who are associated with the purchase transaction. Please 
                        read on for more details. 
                        <p></p>
                        <h2>What information does Kagi collect and how is it used?</h2>
                        Kagi collects and stores customer information only when 
                        you purchase from us. We store the information you personally 
                        provide. If you do not provide it we cannot store it. 
                        Our order forms are customized by each product supplier 
                        and their forms can ask for information other than name, 
                        postal address and email. Except for credit card details, 
                        whatever information you supply on the order forms is 
                        passed through to the product supplier who requested the 
                        information. 
                        <p> When you place an order we may also collect information 
                            on how you communicated with us. We do this primarily 
                            so that we have alternate ways of communicating with 
                            you should the information you provided be inadequate. 
                            Information on how you communicated with us can include: 
                            your Internet address, the language you selected for 
                            viewing the order form, your browser type, the currency 
                            in which you viewed the prices, whether you used a 
                            secure or insecure web page, the return email address 
                            shown in your email messages, the return address on 
                            envelopes, the fax number on faxes, the phone number 
                            from which you are calling and any other information 
                            that might help us to contact you that might be included 
                            with your payment. 
                        </p><p> Except for credit card details, all the information 
                            we collect from you is forwarded to the appropriate 
                            product supplier so that you can receive your product, 
                            support for it, and any additional information that 
                            might be related to your purchase. 
                        </p><p> 
                        </p><h2>Will Kagi disclose information it collects to those 
                            not involved with the purchase transaction?</h2>
                        Since our beginnings in 1994 Kagi has never sold, rented 
                        or traded personal information to others not associated 
                        with a purchase transaction, however we reserve the right 
                        to do so. If Kagi does decide to do this we will email 
                        you and give you 30 days to inform us if you wish for 
                        your information to remain private. At this time we do 
                        not contemplate doing this and thus we have no system 
                        for you to tell us to never release your information. 
                        <p> There can be people outside of Kagi who are associated 
                            with the purchase transaction. They can fulfil a variety 
                            of tasks such as technical support, product shipping, 
                            etc. We have no direct control over their use of the 
                            information we relay to them to complete the purchase 
                            transaction and can make no assurances as to their 
                            use of your personal information. We do stop doing 
                            business with those who are associated with the purchase 
                            transaction if they abuse the information we relay 
                            to them. 
                        </p><p> Kagi does aggregate statistics about the data we collect 
                            and share it with others in order to improve our service. 
                            This aggregated data will not include information 
                            that identifies you personally. 
                        </p><p> 
                        </p><h2>Kagi privacy policy changes</h2>
                        Any changes to the Kagi privacy policy will be posted 
                        here. This policy is dated 24 August 1999.
