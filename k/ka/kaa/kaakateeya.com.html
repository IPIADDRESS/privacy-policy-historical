<br>Kaakateeya.com is a verisign secure site. Click the Image to verify.
<br>
<br>
This website takes every precaution to protect our usersâ€™ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
<br>
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just â€˜surfingâ€™.  To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.verisign.com">Verisign</a>    
<br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our usersâ€™ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customersâ€™ information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
<br>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to info@kaakateeya.com.

<br>
<br>

<br>
In order for this website to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individualâ€™s preference, we combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners, Company Y &amp; Company Z, to create a personalized user profile.
