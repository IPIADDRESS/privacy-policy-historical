</span></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">A user may email

</span></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">IP, browser and
cookie data are utilized for the purpose of customizing the site for each user.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">Customer Service</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">If you choose to bookmark a
page on Kaboodle or post messages in our message areas, we will collect that
information you provide to us. Kaboodle employees may examine this data on an
individual user basis as necessary to provide customer support and troubleshoot
problems as permitted by law. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">Emails Sent To Kaboodle</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">If you send us personal
correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties
send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may
collect such information into a file specific to you. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">Use of Personal
Information</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">As Kaboodle is a free site,
we may use your bookmarks to improve our marketing and promotional efforts by
providing targeted advertising based on the content of the pages.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">On an aggregate,
non-personally identifiable level we may also use this data to analyze site
usage and customize the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses
improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you
with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the
Site.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">As a matter of policy, we <span class="highligh">do not</span> sell or rent any of your personal information to
third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information
may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services:</span></p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in"><span class="sub-header"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">
Advertisers.</span></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">
We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts)
personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally
identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing
and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to
these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. </span></p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in"><span class="sub-header"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
">Kaboodle Community.</span></span><span style="font-size:
10.0pt;"> Your User ID, bookmarks and any content you generate
via message boards are displayed throughout the Site.&nbsp;
Therefore this data is available to the public. All of your activities on the
Site will be identifiable to your User ID. Other people can see your bookmarks,
comments, and any other pages you have created on the Kaboodle service.</span></p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in"><span class="sub-header"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
">Legal Requests.</span></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">
Kaboodle cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well
as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights,
fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the Kaboodle community from
those doing harm. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law
enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation
or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your
user ID, email, bookmarks, and site usage history without a subpoena.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">If you are participating in
the Kaboodle service, we may send emails to you from time to time indicating
updates to the Kaboodle service and soliciting your feedback.&nbsp; If you do
not wish to receive emails from Kaboodle, you may indicate so within your
email preferences, when preferences become available on the Kaboodle system. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">Use of Email and Address
Book</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">You may not use the email
feature that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate
our Terms of Service. We may permanently store email addresses sent from these
tools for the purpose of simplifying future emails you wish to send out.&nbsp;
We do not read the content of these emails. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">If you send and email using
the service to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do
not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email. We do
not rent or sell these email addresses.&nbsp; We do not market to these emails
in any way as a direct result of your submission of their email.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Other users may send emails to you via the
Kaboodle service.&nbsp; Kaboodle does not review these messages before they
are sent to you.&nbsp; In the future, Kaboodle will provide you with a means
of blocking emails from specific users you designate.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Notice</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time
by posting the amend terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically
be effective immediately and we are not required to notify you of the changes.</span></p>
