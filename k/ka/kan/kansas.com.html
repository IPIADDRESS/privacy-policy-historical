<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h5>Effective Date: February 23, 2007.</h5>

<p>The Wichita Eagle has a firm commitment to privacy. We take your privacy concerns seriously and want
to make every effort to address them as we strive to offer our site visitors a high quality,
interactive and personalized experience. That is why we have adopted the following policy,
which explains our position on information gathering and how we intend to use and share any
information we collect. It is important to note that this policy applies only to information
collected by The Wichita Eagle and does not apply to information obtained or used by The The Wichita Eagle or
its affiliates through other means.</p>

<p>The Wichita Eagle collects and stores Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, address,
e-mail address, etc.  What information we collect and store depends on the page you are
visiting and the services you elect to participate in.  We use this information to operate
our services, provide you with the highest quality services, offer you opportunities we think
will be of interest, and better tailor the advertising you see from us to suit you.  This
information is not shared with anyone outside of The The Wichita Eagle and The Wichita Eagle except as
provided for in this Privacy Policy.  More specifics on the information we collect are
outlined within this policy.</p>

<p>This privacy policy is subject to change from time to time. If the policy is revised, a
notice will be placed in the Member Center where registered members of our service may also
update their personal information, subscribe to e-mail newsletters and revise the permissions
that they previously granted The Wichita Eagle.  They may also receive an e-mail outlining the change.
Non-registered users of The Wichita Eagle may view the privacy policy, including any revisions, by
clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on the home page of The Wichita Eagle. If the changes represent
a material departure from our current policy or materially affect users' rights and
obligations, if feasible, the changes will be posted on this page 30 days in advance of their
effective date.</p>

<h2>What information we collect and how it is used</h2>
<p>Access to special content, services and features on The Wichita Eagle requires users to be subscribers
to The The Wichita Eagle and to become registered members at The Wichita Eagle. Member registration requires you
to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, e-mail address,
street address, gender, and date of birth. You will be asked to select a membername and
password so that you have access to this information and can revise it in the future.  To
complete the registration process, we will send you a validation e-mail message.  You must
click the link in the e-mail to fully activate your membership account.  You will also have the
opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and alerts and elect to receive E-mail Offers
sent to you on behalf of The Wichita Eagle advertisers.  Some features and services may require additional
Personally Identifiable Information or other demographic information.  We may collect other
personal information when you provide feedback, comments, engage in chat, message boards,
interactive forums or participate in surveys, or if you contact us offline.  For example, when
you enter contests you will be asked to also provide your phone number so that we can reach you
in the event you’ve won a prize.  All users may decline to share such information with us, by
choosing not to register on the web site or use our services.  Only registered members, however,
may access certain content, services and features.</p>

<p>You may also be asked to create a separate registration account with some of the services
provided by partners and other providers on The Wichita Eagle.  An example is the sacbeeMail e-mail service.
Be aware that the information collected by a provider may be subject to the privacy policy and
terms of use of that provider, and we recommend reviewing these prior to submitting your
registration.</p>

<p>If you wish to forward an article to a friend, we will ask that you provide your friend’s name
and e-mail address.  While we may collect statistics on which articles are forwarded, we do not
sell, rent, or market your friend’s personal information, and retain the information only as long
as necessary to provide this service.</p>

<h2>Passive Data Collection and Use</h2>
<p>Like most Web sites, The Wichita Eagle also collects and logs information automatically and through the
use of electronic tools that may be transparent to you, such as your IP address, the name and
location of your Internet Service Provider, the type and version of your browser, the length of
time that you stay on The Wichita Eagle, search queries, your click-stream data, the location that referred
you to The Wichita Eagle and the average number of pages viewed. If you visit another website prior to
browsing The Wichita Eagle, that website might place personally identifiable information within a URL, which
may be logged by us.  Your IP address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer when
you access the Internet. Depending on how you connect to the Internet, your IP address may always
be the same, or it may change each time you access the Internet.  Note that logging your IP
address does not in and of itself provide us with your name, e-mail address or home or work
address.  We use this log information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and
may also use it to gather general demographic information about you such as your general location
and your Internet Service Provider.  In order to better provide our services to you and to develop
member profiles that enable us to focus our site, services and advertisements on your interests,
we may correlate this log information with other information about you, such as your registration
information or newspaper subscription records.</p>

<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
<p>Most standard Web browsers contain a feature called "cookies," which allow a Web site to place
information about a user's visit to that Web site in a small data text file that is stored on the
user's computer.  Our use of cookie technology will likely be transparent to you and is used to
recognize you and hold information from one visit to the next in an effort to increase your ease
of use of The Wichita Eagle and to allow us to better understand how people use our site through click-stream
analysis.  For example, cookies are used to store your membername and password, sparing you from
having to re-enter that information each time you visit.   Another example is that we may use
cookie technology to control the number of times you see a particular advertisement while visiting
The Wichita Eagle.   You can turn the cookies feature off by using your browser preference options, but doing
so will severely limit your access to The Wichita Eagle and may prevent you from registration.</p>

<p>Some of The Wichita Eagle’s third party content providers also may place a cookie on the user’s computer.
If a user chooses to monitor or restrict cookies that are placed on his computer, the user can
determine the Web site that is attempting to place a cookie. Those cookies are controlled by the
content provider, and users should refer to that provider’s privacy policy for further information
regarding its use of cookies.</p>

<p>We use software developed by another company, RealMedia, to display advertising on The Wichita Eagle, and
we may use cookies in conjunction with displaying those ads. In addition, advertisers may elect to
use other advertising companies to serve their ads on The Wichita Eagle, and advertisers themselves may also
place a cookie on a user’s computer. We do not have access to the cookies or their contents that
are placed by advertisers or by third-party advertising companies.</p>

<h2>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information may be accessed by the user who entered it, by The
The Wichita Eagle and The Wichita Eagle personnel, and by certain third parties, such as those who provide technical
support or content services to The Wichita Eagle.  We ask these third parties to keep any personal information
supplied by us confidential.   We also endeavor to keep your Personally Identifiable Information
inaccessible to other users or advertisers of The Wichita Eagle.  Note that your first name may be displayed
on The Wichita Eagle when you visit The Wichita Eagle as a logged in member.   We will also display your e-mail address
and contact information in your Member Center.   We make every effort to make the Member Center
secure, such that; it can only be accessed by logging in with your membername and password.</p>

<p>We also reserve the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information when deemed necessary
or appropriate to comply with the law, respond to claims, protect our computer systems and customers,
ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems, or protect the rights, property or
safety of The Wichita Eagle, its affiliates, or others.</p>

<p>We will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information without your advance permission
except as explained in this privacy policy or as explained at the time the information was collected.</p>

<h2>Use of Aggregated information</h2>
<p>In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may use your
Personally Identifiable Information to create a compiled, aggregate view of the The Wichita Eagle audience and
their usage patterns.  We use Aggregated Information to operate our services and to better understand
our audience as we develop new content and services.  Aggregated Information may also be shared with
third parties we contract with to provide content and services on The Wichita Eagle as well as advertisers so
that they can better understand our audience.  For example, we might disclose that a certain
percentage of our users are female or within a certain age range or live within a cluster of zip
codes. </p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The Wichita Eagle is particularly concerned with providing a safe online environment for children.  Children
under the age 13 will not be allowed to register and become a member of The Wichita Eagle in order to access
general The Wichita Eagle content, features and services.</p>

<p>In the near future, parents and legal guardians of children under age 13 who register are able to
establish a member account for their child by accessing the Member Center.  Other areas and services
operated by The Wichita Eagle that do not require registration but that ask for Personally Identifiable
Information from children under age 13 will require a parental consent before collecting the
information.  The The Wichita Eagle does not ask children under age 13 for more personal information, as a
condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity or
promotion.  Further, we limit most of our contests to people who are at least 18 years of age, making
children ineligible to enter.</p>

<p>Parental consent to collect information about children can be provided in two ways: (1) Fax a copy
of a completed <a href="/359/">Parental Consent Form</a>, including 
your signature, to the facsimile number provided on
the Parental Consent Form. This form will be available in applicable areas of our site. (2) Mail a
completed Parental Consent Form to the address indicated.</p>

<p>The Wichita Eagle will not knowingly disclose personal information about users under the age of 13 without
prior parental or legal guardian consent, except as required by law. If for any reason you wish to
access, update or remove information about your child that has been previously provided to The Wichita Eagle,
you may fax us (at xxx-xxx-xxxx), call us (at 316-268-6000) or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:email">email</a>.</p>

<p>The Wichita Eagle strongly recommends parental supervision when a child uses the Internet, particularly when
a child enters a forum or uses e-mail. We also encourage parents to instruct their children not to
give out personal information in these areas.</p>

<h2>Member Mail and E-mail Offers</h2>
<p>The Wichita Eagle does not rent, sell, barter or give away its user or member lists or its users' or members’
names, e-mail addresses or mailing addresses for use by advertisers and other third parties for the
purpose of solicitations, unless the user has previously given his or her consent at the time of general
registration or registration for a specific contest or service. If a user granted permission to receive
solicitations (referred to as E-mail Offers) at the time of registration but subsequently wishes to opt
out from receiving such solicitations, the user may go to the Member Center and change one or more of the
category-specific permission related to receiving e-mail from The The Wichita Eagle and The Wichita Eagle advertisers.</p>

<p>All registered users will receive periodic Member Mail via e-mail related to their membership account
or various features and services on The Wichita Eagle that their membership entitles them to access.  Because Member
Mail is an important part of our service to you, users cannot opt-out of receiving Member Mail.</p>

<p>Separate from The Wichita Eagle Member Mail, The The Wichita Eagle may send you information via e-mail about various
products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, including e-mails that may contain
content provided by third party advertisers.  If you don't want to receive this information, you can opt
out by changing your permission setting for The The Wichita Eagle Promotions e-mail in the Member Center. The
Member Center also allows you to select which categories of E-mail Offers might interest you.</p>

<p>When a user specifically authorizes e-mail solicitations we make available the user names and other
Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the applicable license.</p>

<p>Our HTML-encoded e-mail messages may include graphic files, which we use to gather information about
e-mails sent our members.  When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient’s
computer accesses our server to retrieve the graphic file, and allows us to record and store the date and
time, the recipient’s e-mail address, and other standard logging information.  These HTML-encoded e-mail
messages may also read cookies.</p>

<h2>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</h2>
<p>The Wichita Eagle expects its partners, providers of content and services and advertisers to respect the privacy
of our users.  Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, providers of content and
services, advertisers and others accessible through our site may have their own privacy and data collection
policies and practices.  For example, during your visit to The Wichita Eagle you may link to, or view as part of a
frame on a The Wichita Eagle page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.  Also through
The Wichita Eagle you may be introduced to, or be able to access information, services, Web sites, features, contest
or sweepstakes offered by other parties.   The The Wichita Eagle and The Wichita Eagle are not responsible for the actions
or policies of such third parties.  You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties
when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>

<h2>Electronic commerce with The The Wichita Eagle</h2>
<p>For certain electronic commerce services on The Wichita Eagle, such as placing classified ads electronically or
subscribing to The The Wichita Eagle newspaper, we require additional information. To complete these transactions,
we may collect information from you such as your name, credit card number and other financial or Personally
Identifiable Information. We endeavor to protect the security of your payment information during transmission
by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts information you submit.  The The Wichita Eagle uses
the credit card and shipping information for the purpose of completing the transaction and does not provide
this information to third parties except for the issuers of credit cards in order to process the transaction,
or as otherwise set forth in this policy.</p>

<h2>Changing your personal information</h2>
<p>In general, a registered member may return to his or her account information page in the Member Center to
update the information he or she previously provided to us.  To prevent minors from improperly entering
contests for which they are not eligible, we may require additional proof from people asking to change their
birth date information.  Information you provide to The Wichita Eagle may be stored by us for an indefinite time. This
information includes the registration data as well as information provided in conjunction with various
membership services, contests or features available on The Wichita Eagle</p>

<p>You can delete your The Wichita Eagle membership account in Member Center by clicking on the link labeled “delete my
account.”  By doing so, all but a transactional record of your membership account will be removed from our
databases, though some records may remain on back-up media.  Note that by deleting your account, you will
cancel your membership and no longer be able to access The Wichita Eagle.</p>

<h2>Remember the risks when you use the Internet</h2>
<p>You should know that when you voluntarily disclose personal information on the The Wichita Eagle Web site (for
example, in the discussion forums), that information can be collected and used by others and may result in
unsolicited messages from other people. While we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot
be responsible for information that you choose to publicly disclose. Further, you are solely responsible for
maintaining the secrecy of any passwords or other account information.  Although we make good faith efforts
to store the information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public and
to work with responsible third parties, we cannot guarantee complete security for your information.</p>

<p>In addition, our advertisers, content providers, partners and other Internet sites or services that may be
accessible through The Wichita Eagle have separate data and privacy practices that are independent of us, and we disclaim
any responsibility or liability for their policies or actions. Please contact those sites directly if you have
questions about their privacy policies.</p>

<h2>International users</h2>
<p>If you are an international user, by using The Wichita Eagle or by registering for any of its services, you agree
that The Wichita Eagle may collect, use and transfer your personal information as described in this privacy policy,
including transfers outside the country where you live. If you reside in a country in the European Union or
other jurisdiction that provides access rights under law, you may access your personal information or have
it corrected or updated by going to your account information page and personally updating the information.
in accordance with applicable law by contacting us. In some jurisdictions, you may be charged a reasonable
fee for access to information.</p>

<h2>Platform for Privacy Preferences.</h2>
<p>The Wichita Eagle supports P3P, the Platform for Privacy Preferences, which allows us to convey our privacy policies,
to the extent possible, in standardized, machine-readable code.  While our site supports P3P, the resulting
code has inherent limitations such that it does not fully and may not accurately express all of our data
practices.  Some P3P-enabled browsers may interpret the same P3P code in different ways, while others may
interpret P3P code in a manner inconsistent with the original intention.  Accordingly, your browser’s
interpretation of the P3P code should only be considered as a short-hand expression of our privacy practices.
This Privacy Policy remains our primary policy, and takes precedence over the P3P code for all purposes.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p>In the event of the sale or merger of The The Wichita Eagle Company and/or The McClatchy Company, ownership of
the information described in this Privacy Policy will be transferred to the acquiring or successor company.</p>

<p>The Wichita Eagle endorses and abides by the privacy principles approved by the Interactive Services Association and
the Direct Marketing Association. If you have any questions or comments about our policies, we may be reached
at The Wichita Eagle, 825 E. Douglas, Wichita, KS 67201-0820, at 316-268-6000 or at email.</p>
