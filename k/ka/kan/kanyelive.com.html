Hey so we have a legal requirement to put this stuff here. DON'T WORRY: THIS IS GENERAL WEBSITE STUFF. Most websites are legally required to have one.<br>

<p style="font-size:10px;">Like most websites, kanYeLive.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. kanYeLive.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how kanYeLive.com’s visitors use its website.</p>
 
<p style="font-size:10px;">kanYeLive.com also collects <strong>potentially</strong> personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. kanYeLive.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information.</p>

<p style="font-size:10px;">Certain visitors to kanYeLive.com choose to interact with kanYeLive.com in ways that require kanYeLive.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that kanYeLive.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors register at kanYeLive.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with kanYeLive.com – by purchasing premium membership, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, kanYeLive.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with kanYeLive.com. kanYeLive.com does not disclose personally-identifying information, and visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<p style="font-size:10px;">kanYeLive.com may use cookies to store information on your computer, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This includes the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.</p>

<p style="font-size:10px;">kanYeLive.com may serve advertisements from a third-party such as Google. These third-party companies may also leave cookies on your computer. They may also use information (NOT personally-identifying) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know your options in relation to not having this information used by these companies, click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:10px;">You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings.  However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.  This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>

<p>Cookies are used on the vast majority of websites and are not a security risk. NO personally-identifying information (such as your name and email adress) is EVER given to third-party companies.</p>
