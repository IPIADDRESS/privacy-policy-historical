                        <p class="text">In this Information Age, you need to know how information 
                          about you is gathered and used on the Internet. At Kanoodle.com, 
                          we take your privacy seriously and do all we can to 
                          protect it. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect 
                          and use information about you as you utilize Kanoodle.com. 
                          Our Privacy Policy is subject to change, so we encourage 
                          you to visit this page occasionally for more information.</p><br>
                          
                        <p class="subhead">Why We Collect Personal Information.</p>
                          
						<p class="text">First and foremost, Kanoodle.com collects personal information 
                          to personalize your experience with our site. The more 
                          we know about you, the more we can present you with 
                          information and features that will interest you. The 
                          facts you provide, along with data stored in your personal 
                          "cookie," (see below) may also be used to 
                          make online shopping faster and more convenient by helping 
                          us understand your shopping needs and patterns.</p>
                          
                        <p class="text">We also use user information to measure our success 
                          and performance. For example, aggregate information 
                          gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract 
                          and how they navigate they site. By collecting information, 
                          we can also figure the number of entries in Kanoodle.com 
                          promotions and contents. The information we collect 
                          enables us to contact users with offers and advertisements 
                          that may appeal to them. At times, we may also use the 
                          information we collect to notify users of site updates 
                          and to promote special events at Kanoodle.com.</p><br>
                          
                        <p class="subhead">How We Gather Data on Kanoodle.com Users.</p>
                          
                        <p class="text">We gather information in a number of ways, depending 
                          on the section you are using within Kanoodle.com.</p>
                          
                        <p class="text">Sometimes, we simply ask you to provide your name, 
                          e-mail address, zip code, and country. Whenever you 
                          give this kind of information, it helps us to tailor 
                          our content for you.</p>
                          
                        <p class="text">At other times – such as when you buy compact 
                          discs, enter Kanoodle.com promotions or contents, or 
                          answer surveys on our site – we may ask for more 
                          detailed personal information. For instance, when you 
                          make a purchase through Kanoodle.com, we collect your 
                          billing and shipping address, telephone number, credit 
                          card information, and other information necessary to 
                          complete the transaction.</p>
                          
                        <p class="text">Wherever we ask you for personal information, we try 
                          to include a link to this Privacy Policy for your review.</p><br>
                          
                        <p class="subhead">Other Companies’ Access to Your Personal Information.</p>
                          
                        <p class="text">Kanoodle.com does not sell, rent or trade user information 
                          to other companies. Our site may link to advertisers 
                          and sites that collect personally identifiable information 
                          about you when you access them from Kanoodle.com. This 
                          type of collection or use of personal information is 
                          beyond Kanoodle.com’s control and is not covered 
                          by this Privacy Policy.</p>
                          
                        <p class="text">We may occasionally need to share your information 
                          with business partners who co-sponsor contests or other 
                          services. In these cases, we will provide only the data 
                          that is needed to make the service or contest successful. 
                          If we plan to share this type of information, we will 
                          notify you before we collect it. If you do not want 
                          Kanoodle.com to share your information, simply choose 
                          not to allow the transfer by not using or signing up 
                          for the contest or service in question.</p>

                          may need to share some personal information with the 
                          third parties helping us to complete your transaction 
                          or send you the items you have requested. When we share 
                          your information with such third parties, we will disclose 
                          only the information needed to complete your transaction.</p><br>
