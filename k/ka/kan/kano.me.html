<h3 id="privacy-policy-cookie-policy">PRIVACY POLICY &amp; COOKIE POLICY</h3>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us (Kano Computing Limited (“Kano”, “us” or “we”)), and we want to be upfront about how and when we use your personal details. The long and short of it is: we’re good people. We collect personal information mainly to make your experience with us as excellent as possible, and we’ll never sell your data to third parties or use it without your permission. The privacy policy below, together with the <a href="/terms-of-use">terms of use</a> and <a href="https://checkout.shopify.com/2138552/policies/910847">terms and conditions of supply</a>, explains in more detail exactly what kind of information we may collect and how we use it. We’ve tried to simplify it as much as possible, but if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kano.me">privacy@kano.me</a>.</p>
<h3 id="information-we-may-collect-about-you">Information we may collect about you</h3>
<p>We may collect and process the following information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Information you provide while buying a Kano kit (“Kit”) from us or while visiting the website. For example, shipping information when ordering a Kit, or your email address when signing up for the newsletter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence, such as an email.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may also ask you to complete surveys that help us improve our services, though these are completely optional. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information). This helps us improve your experience, for example by making sure the website is optimized for the browser you’re using.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Details of your visits to <a href="http://www.kano.me">www.kano.me</a> (the <strong>“Website”</strong>), which helps us improve the website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we collect this information, we will keep it only as long as necessary – meaning usually as long as it takes for you to receive your Kano Kit, get customer support after receiving your Kit, respond to any problems you might have, or as otherwise required by law. </p>
<h3 id="ip-addresses">IP Addresses</h3>
<p>We may collect information about your computer, such as your IP address, operating system and browser type. This helps us improve our website and services so we can provide the best possible experience for you – for example, by optimizing the site for the browser you’re using.</p>
<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
<p>Like many websites, we use cookies to help us provide you with the best possible web experience. </p>
<h4 id="what-are-cookies-">What are cookies?</h4>
<p>Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your device the next time you visit.  We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.</p>
<p>There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember your username and preferences, analyse how well the Website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.</p>
<p>Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies will not collect information that identifies you, but will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use the Website.</p>
<h4 id="what-sort-of-cookies-does-the-website-use-">What sort of cookies does the Website use?</h4>
<p>Generally, our cookies perform up to three different functions:</p>
<p>1 - <em>Essential Cookies</em></p>
<p>Some cookies are essential for the operation of the Website. If you opt to disable these cookies, you will not be able to access or use all of the features that the Website incorporates.</p>
<p>2 - <em>Performance Cookies</em></p>
<p>We use other cookies to help us understand how our visitors use the website, and help us monitor and improve performance. For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular or figure out why some pages are displaying error messages. </p>
<p>3 - <em>Functionality Cookies</em></p>
<p>We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you use the Website, and recall your customisation preferences such as geographical location.</p>
<p>4 - <em>Targeting Cookies</em></p>
<p>These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We use this information to customize the website with more interesting content for you, and we may also share this information with trusted partners. The information that is shared is anonymous and not confidential.</p>
<h4 id="does-anyone-else-use-cookies-on-the-website-">Does anyone else use cookies on the Website?</h4>
<p>We do use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the three categories above. For example, like many companies, we use Google Analytics to help us monitor our traffic. We may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, revenue tracking, improving site functionality and monitoring compliance with our terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We sometimes advertise on third party websites, and we may allow our trusted advertising partners to place targeting cookies so that we can provide more interesting content.</p>
<h4 id="can-you-block-cookies-">Can you block cookies?</h4>
<p>As we have explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of the Website.</p>
<p>However, if you do wish to disable cookies then you can do so by amending the settings within your browser or mobile device.</p>
<p>Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of the Website do not work properly.</p>
<h4 id="more-information">More Information</h4>
<p>More detail on how businesses use cookies is available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. If you have any queries regarding this Cookie Policy please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kano.me">privacy@kano.me</a>.</p>
<h3 id="where-we-store-your-personal-information">Where we store your personal information</h3>
<p>The data we collect from you is stored in the UK but may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside of the European Economic Area (<strong>“EEA”</strong>). It may also be processed by staff operating outside of the EEA. By submitting your personal data, you expressly agree to this transfer, storing and processing.</p>
<p>We do not disclose your account details, postal or email addresses to anyone except when legally required to do so. </p>
<p>Sensitive information between your browser and the Website is transferred in encrypted form using Secure Socket Layer (<strong>“SSL”</strong>). When transmitting sensitive information, you should always make sure that your browser can validate the Website’s certificate. </p>
<p>It is your responsibility to keep your password secure. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although Kano will do its best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website, any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try and prevent any unauthorised access.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-use-your-information">How we use your information</h3>
<p>We want to give you the best possible experience when using our website or buying a Kit, and the information we collect helps us: </p>

<li><p>to provide you with our services, such as shipping you the product you ordered</p>
</li>
<li><p>to show you the most relevant and interesting content </p>
</li>
<li><p>to optimize the website for the device and browser you’re using </p>
</li>
<li><p>to notify you about changes to our service.</p>
</li>

<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets;</p>
</li>
<li><p>if Kano or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party; or</p>
</li>
<li><p>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Kano, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="your-rights">Your rights</h3>
<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kano.me">privacy@kano.me</a>.</p>
