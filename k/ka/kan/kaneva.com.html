<p><b>Kaneva, Inc. is strongly committed to protecting the
privacy of consumers of its interactive products and services. Throughout
cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment
for consumers.</b></p>

<p></p>

<p>The purpose of this Kaneva, Inc. privacy policy is to
inform you, as a welcome visitor to Kaneva, what kinds of information we may
gather about you when you visit Kaneva, how we may use that information,
whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use
of, and your ability to correct, the information. This privacy policy applies
to the Kaneva site and other Internet-accessible Kaneva-branded services that
incorporate this policy (although we will refer here only to Kaneva, Inc. to
make reading this policy easier). Finally, please note that this policy applies
only to Kaneva, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to
which we link.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Information About All
Kaneva Visitors </span></b><br><br><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><br>

In general, our site automatically gathers certain usage
information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Kaneva and its areas,
very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned
in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This aggregate data
helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can
improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as
many of you as possible. For example, Kaneva uses a technology nicknamed
"cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited,
and by how many people. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable
information and we do not combine information collected through these cookies
with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even
what your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide statistical
"ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our
Kaneva partners about how our members, collectively, use Kaneva. We do this so
they too can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order
for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. Finally,
Kaneva, its advertisers and ad servers may also use cookies, as well as small
pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs," to
determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements and promotions users have
seen and how users responded to them, but do not use these technologies to
collect personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do
so.

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Information About You</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> <br><br>

If you are a Kaneva Member or Subscriber, when you access
Kaneva you may obtain access to features of the Kaneva service that contain
personal information, such as e-mail. Additionally, we may specifically ask for
information about you when you sign up to use a service, like Kaneva, or when
you order a product. We will need certain information -- such as name, Internet
address, billing address, type of computer, credit card number -- in order to
provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to let
you know of additional products and services about which you might be
interested. You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to
by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product
or service. We may ask you for information about your interests so that both
you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but
you may always choose to respond or not. Additionally, we may provide you with
an opportunity to be listed in a directory on one of our Kaneva-branded
services -- these listings are also optional and you can make changes to or
eliminate this information when you want to. We also use cookie technology in
order to improve your experience, including to remember your preferences or customized
settings when you use Kaneva and its related services, and to authenticate your
access to your personal information.

cases such as a physical threat to you or others. And, as we mention above, we
may share with our Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings"
information about the use of Kaneva. We do retain the right to provide all
information collected, including your personal information, to any successor
company in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of Kaneva, Inc., its
