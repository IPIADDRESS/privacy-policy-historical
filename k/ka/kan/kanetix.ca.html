<strong>Security</strong><br>
Entering personal data on KANETIX is not only easy but also safe. KANETIX uses an Apache server with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol, among the best Internet security software in the world, and Entrust.net certificates for securing the exchange of confidential data. This security technology encrypts the personal information that you send us (including things like names, addresses, emails and telephone numbers), so it cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. We will evaluate and adopt new security technology as it becomes available.
<br><br>
You can find out when the secure SSL connection is activated by looking for the key or padlock icon in the lower corner of your browser window. If the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, this indicates that the browser is now in "secure" mode.
<br><br>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about security on our website, you can <a onclick="javascript:email_us();return false;" href="https://www.kanetix.ca/about_generic_about_history">send us an email through our online form</a>. <br><br>

<strong>Collecting information</strong><br>
We gather and store data about online usage on a collective rather than individual basis. For example, like most websites, we gather aggregate information about the number of visitors that visit our website and the pages that they view, NOT what pages were viewed by each individual. We use this information to anticipate bottlenecks, to gauge the capacity of our servers, and to improve the overall management of our website.
<br><br>
We also use Commission Junction to track visitors coming from our affiliate sites. This pixel tracking information helps determine the payments we are obliged to make to our affiliates for the traffic they send to us. We also use a third party tracking-utility company which uses pixel tracking to help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
<br><br>
Please note that our online usage and affiliate tracking systems do not gather or store personal information. <br><br>
<strong>Collecting personal identifiable information</strong><br>
In some provinces, KANETIX offers visitors the option of personalized quotes and gathers personal information as part of this process. Depending on the province, this may include obtaining your credit score from a credit reporting agency, or require you to provide details regarding your credit history. This information, along with the other details you enter will be used to provide you with a personalized offer and to determine the payment options that will be available to you.
<br><br>
Also, from time to time, KANETIX requests and collects personal information from visitors via surveys, contests, "Tell-a-friend" and Renewal Reminder services. Participation is completely voluntary (opt-in). Information requested has included your email address and that of the friend you are referring.
<br><br>
Finally, you can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network. 
<br><br>
