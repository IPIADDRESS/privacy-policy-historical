<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Security</span><br>
 Entering personal data on <i>kanetix</i> is not only easy but also safe.  <i>kanetix</i> uses an Apache server with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol, among the best Internet security software in the world, and Entrust.net certificates for securing the exchange of confidential data. This security technology encrypts the personal information that you send us (including things like names, addresses, emails and telephone numbers), so it cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. We will evaluate and adopt new security technology as it becomes available.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>You can find out when the secure SSL connection is activated by looking for the key or padlock icon in the lower corner of your browser window. If the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, this indicates that the browser is now in "secure" mode.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>If you have any questions about security on our website, you can <a href="http://www.kanetix.ca/about_generic_about_us" onclick="javascript:email_us('generic', '167531498');return false;">send us an email through our online form</a>.</h4> 
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Cookie tracking method</span><br>
Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive.  The only personal information that a cookie can contain is information supplied by the visitor and the cookies we use cannot read data off of our visitor's hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>Cookie technology can save you time by eliminating the need to re-enter frequently requested information such as your personal identification. Cookies also give us capability to understand how visitors use our site. We use this information to optimize our website and improve the visitor experience. </h4>
<p></p>
<h4>Please note that you have the option to set your browser to decline our cookies. If you choose not to receive cookies from <i>kanetix</i>, you may not be able to use all the services available on the site. These cookies are not tied to your personally identifiable information.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Collecting information</span><br>
We gather and store data about online usage on a collective rather than individual basis.  For example, like most websites, we gather aggregate information about the number of visitors that visit our website and the pages that they view, NOT what pages were viewed by each individual.  We use this information to anticipate bottlenecks, to gauge the capacity of our servers, and to improve the overall management of our website.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4> We also use <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cj.com" target="new">Commission Junction</a> to track visitors coming from our affiliate sites. This pixel tracking information helps determine the payments we are obliged to make to our affiliates for the traffic they send to us. </h4> 
<p></p>
<h4>Please note that our online usage and affiliate tracking systems do not gather or store personally identifiable information.</h4>
<p></p>          
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Collecting personal identifiable information</span>
<br>
In some provinces, <i>kanetix</i> offers visitors the option of personalized quotes and gathers personal information as part of this process.  Also, from time to time, <i>kanetix</i> requests and collects personal information from visitors via surveys, contests, "Tell-a-friend" and Renewal Reminder services.  Participation is completely voluntary (opt-in).  Information requested has included your email address and that of the friend you are referring, name, demographic and insurance-related information.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Communication of personal identifiable information</b><br>
At various points on the <i>kanetix</i> website and when visitors contact <i>kanetix</i>, visitors may be asked if they consent to sharing their personal information with 3rd parties.  If they agree, <i>kanetix</i>, provides one or more insurance suppliers with their personal information for the purposes of either preparing or validating an insurance quote.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Email</b><br>
<i>kanetix</i> will not accept transactions or instructions by Internet email messages. However, questions of a general nature or inquiries may be communicated by <a href="http://www.kanetix.ca/about_generic_about_us" onclick="javascript:email_us('generic', '167531498');return false;">submitting your question online</a>. 
<p></p>
By submitting your question, comment or suggestion online<!--, through the secure SSL connection,--> the information you provide becomes the property of <i>kanetix</i>. Where necessary, we may share the information you provide in your email with 3rd parties in order to address your question, comments or concerns. The content of your email may be used for any purpose and <i>kanetix</i> is free to use any idea contained in it for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products using such information.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Tell-a-friend</b><br>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friendâ€™s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Kanetix Ltd. does not store this information.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">What is this personally identifiable information used for?</span>
          <br>
Our surveys are used to identify consumer or improve visitor satisfaction with our site.  The 'Tell-a-friend' service sends an email to a friend informing him/her about our site.  With our Renewal Reminder service, visitors can elect to have an email reminder sent to them a month before their insurance policy expires.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Policy holder information</span>
          <br>

This information may include your first and last name, email address, and dwelling address; your telephone number, driver's license number, vehicle identification number (if purchasing auto insurance), your current insurance company, employer name and credit card number or bank account information.  We forward this information to the insurance company to underwrite your policy. If you agree to purchase a policy from the insurance company, it may use your personal information for the purpose of fulfilling the requested insurance transaction and for future contact in accordance with the terms and conditions of its own privacy policy.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Service providers</span><br>

<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Testimonials</span>
          <br>
