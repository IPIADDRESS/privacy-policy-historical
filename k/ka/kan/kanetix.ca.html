<b>Security</b>
<br>
Entering personal data on <i>Kanetix</i> is not only easy but also safe.  <i>Kanetix</i> uses an Apache server with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol, among the best Internet security software in the world, and Entrust.net certificates for securing the exchange of confidential data. This security technology encrypts the personal information that you send us (including things like names, addresses, emails and telephone numbers), so it cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. We will evaluate and adopt new security technology as it becomes available.
<br><br>
You can find out when the secure SSL connection is activated by looking for the key or padlock icon in the lower corner of your browser window. If the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, this indicates that the browser is now in "secure" mode.
<br><br>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about security on our website, you can <a href="http://www.kanetix.ca/about_us" onclick="javascript:email_us();return false;">send us an email through our online form</a>.
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b>
<br>
Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive.  The only personal information that a cookie can contain is information supplied by the visitor and the cookies we use cannot read data off of our visitor's hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.
<br><br>
Cookie technology can save you time by eliminating the need to re-enter frequently requested information. Cookies also give us capability to understand how visitors use our site. We use this information to optimize our website and improve the visitor experience.
<br><br>
We use both session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you choose to tick the box indicating you would like to be remembered, a persistent cookie is set so you don't have to reenter your login information more than once. If you later decide that you would no longer like to be 'remembered', the cookie will be removed when you log off. You can also remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
<br><br>
<b>Log files</b>
<br>
As is true of most Web sites, we and our third party tracking-utility partner to gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  
<br><br>
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
<br><br>
<b>Advertising</b>
<br>
We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites as well as within our site.  Our ad network partner uses cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests and your actions on our site.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.

<br><br>
<b>Collecting information</b>
<br>
We gather and store data about online usage on a collective rather than individual basis.  For example, like most websites, we gather aggregate information about the number of visitors that visit our website and the pages that they view, NOT what pages were viewed by each individual.  We use this information to anticipate bottlenecks, to gauge the capacity of our servers, and to improve the overall management of our website.
<br><br>
We also use Commission Junction to track visitors coming from our affiliate sites. This pixel tracking information helps determine the payments we are obliged to make to our affiliates for the traffic they send to us. We also use a third party tracking-utility company which uses pixel tracking to help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. 
<br><br>
Please note that our online usage and affiliate tracking systems do not gather or store personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
<b>Collecting personal identifiable information</b>
<br>
In some provinces, <i>Kanetix</i> offers visitors the option of personalized quotes and gathers personal information as part of this process.  Depending on the province, this may include obtaining your credit score from a credit reporting agency, or require you to provide details regarding your credit history. This information, along with the other details you enter will be used to provide you with a personalized offer and to determine the payment options that will be available to you.
<br><br>
Also, from time to time, <i>Kanetix</i> requests and collects personal information from visitors via surveys, contests, "Tell-a-friend" and Renewal Reminder services.  Participation is completely voluntary (opt-in).  Information requested has included your email address and that of the friend you are referring.
<br><br>
Finally, you can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.
<br><br>
<b>Communication of personal identifiable information</b>
<br>
At various points on the <i>Kanetix</i> website and when visitors contact <i>Kanetix</i>, visitors may be asked if they consent to sharing their personal information with 3rd parties.  If they agree, <i>Kanetix</i> provides one or more 3rd parties with their personal information for the purposes of either preparing or validating an insurance quote or providing marketing services as explicitly requested by the visitor.
<br><br>
<b>Email</b>
<br>
<i>Kanetix</i> will not accept transactions or instructions by Internet email messages. However, questions of a general nature or inquiries may be communicated by <a href="http://www.kanetix.ca/about_us" onclick="javascript:email_us();return false;">submitting your question online</a>.

<br><br>
<b>Tell-a-friend</b>
<br>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Kanetix Ltd. does not store this information.
<br><br>
<b>What is this personally identifiable information used for?</b>
<br>
Our surveys are used to identify consumer or improve visitor satisfaction with our site.  The 'Tell-a-friend' service sends an email to a friend informing him/her about our site.  With our Renewal Reminder service, visitors can elect to have an email reminder sent to them a month before their insurance policy expires.
<br><br>
We will use the email address you provide us to send you copies of the quotes you have requested to obtain a copy for your records. 
<br><br>
<b>Policy holder information</b>
<br>
If you apply online for coverage or purchase a policy online through <i>Kanetix</i>, additional information is needed to process your request. This information may include your first and last name, email address, and dwelling address; your telephone number, driver's licence number, vehicle identification number (if purchasing auto insurance), your current insurance company, employer name and credit card number or bank account information. We may also need to obtain your credit score from a credit reporting agency, or require you to provide details regarding your credit history. This information, along with the other details you have provided will only be used to fulfill services you specifically request. They will not be used for any other reason.
<br><br>
We forward this information to the insurance company who will be reviewing your application or underwriting your policy. If you agree to purchase a policy from the insurance company, it may use your personal information for the purpose of fulfilling the requested insurance transaction and for future contact in accordance with the terms and conditions of its own privacy policy.
<br><br>
