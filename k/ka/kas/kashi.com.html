	Q1: What types of information does Kashi collect and how does the site collect it?
	</h4>
	<p>
	We collect certain information automatically, like IP addresses, browser types, referring websites, and access times, when consumers visit our site.  This "web log" information is not personally identifiable, but provides important information on the number of visitors, and what areas or features they like best.  Our visitors can review our site and participate in many features without disclosing any personally identifiable information.
	</p><p>
	Kashi collects personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, name, home address, email address, and telephone number, from our visitors on a voluntary basis.  We do not require this information for customers to access any of our sites.  However, to participate in some of the programs or features we offer, customers may have to provide personally identifiable information.  We request only the personally identifiable information we feel we need to offer the service or feature or to fulfill requests.  For example, we need your name and email address to add you to an email update list.  We may require a home address and telephone number to enter you in a contest or sweepstakes so that we can send prize notifications and prizes.  We may request feedback from our visitors in the form of surveys, questionnaires or our feedback forms on their preferences and reaction to our products, including demographic information, like age, gender and interests, to help us better serve you.  We ask for credit card information where we offer online shopping opportunities.
	</p><p>
	We may sometimes offer programs with other sponsors where personally identifiable information is shared with both Kashi and a business partner.  In those instances, we will provide you with notice at the time of any registration about the program and will offer you a choice about sharing the information.  If you choose to NOT have your information shared, your information will not be shared and you will not be able to participate in or receive the benefits or services provided by our business partners.
	</p><p class="last">

When you visit our websites, Google may set cookies (i.e., small data files that a site sends to your computer to make your access easier and/or faster) on our behalf and may receive information about your browsing activity (e.g., pages viewed, etc). You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, but if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

	Q3: Does Kashi share the personally identifiable information that it collects?
	</h4><p>
	On sites owned exclusively by Kashi, personally identifiable information received from any visitor will only be used for the purpose for which it was provided or for internal marketing purposes and will not be sold or provided to third parties, except for our technical and fulfillment agents who help us make the site available and provide the services and products on our site.

	</p><p class="last">
	In some circumstances, we may partner with another company to provide certain content, programs or features.  Examples include certain promotions, loyalty programs, sweepstakes or contests.  In those situations, when you provide personally identifiable information about yourself, it may be sent directly to Kashi and to our partner company, or we may share the information with our partner company.  In these circumstances, we will always let you know whether, in addition to Kashi, another company is collecting information or if we need to share your personally identifiable information with a partner company to provide the program, service or feature.  We (and our partner company) will also provide a link to the respective online privacy policies so that you can make an informed decision about whether to share your information.  Although we only partner with companies who agree to adopt privacy policies that are consistent with our own values and policy, we are not responsible for the policies or offerings of any third party, and urge you to review their policies and terms and conditions as they may vary.

	A number of tools exist to help parents manage their children’s online experience, including hardware and software programs that provide filtering options. You can download special software or purchase specific hardware that will limit surfing the sites you deem appropriate for your home. Many of these services are free; others require some form of payment.
	</p><h4>
	Q5: Does Kashi use "cookies" or other tools?
	</h4>
	<p>Yes, Kashi uses "Session Cookies," small data files that a site sends to your computer.  Our cookies allow our site to remember important information that will make your use of the site more enjoyable, efficient and useful; they do not contain personally identifiable information. We use cookies and IP addresses to obtain non-personal information from online visitors and also to provide registered users with a customized, personalized, online experience. They can, for example, help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited, allow you to personalize your pages, and help you to participate in some activities or events on the site. We also use cookies to determine how many people visit our site, and which features are most useful and popular and which may need improvement. We may also use another technology, called clear GIFs or web beacons, to provide us with other important anonymous information, such as when an email has been opened.
	</p><p class="last">
	If you don’t want cookies, you can turn off all cookies or have your computer notify you when cookies are being sent by following the instructions for your particular web browser, such as Netscape, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer.
	</p><h4>
	Q6: What type of security does Kashi provide?
	</h4><p>
	Kashi uses its best efforts to make sure all information received from our online visitors is secure from unauthorized access and use. All personally identifiable information from our customers is protected by our security measures, which are periodically reviewed. Kashi also requires agents used by Kashi for fulfillment and technical services to sign confidentiality agreements protecting your information.
	</p><p class="last">
	Kashi cares about the safety and security of your credit card transactions or shareholder information and uses 124-bit SSL ("Secure Sockets Layer") when you provide your credit card or other similar sensitive personal information to us online. SSL is the industry standard security protocol which makes it difficult for others to intercept your information online.  You should keep in mind, however, that no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used by parties other than the intended recipient. 
	</p><h4>
	Q7: Does Kashi provide links to other sites?
	</h4><p class="last">
	The Kashi site may contain links to other sites. We make every effort only to link to websites that share our high standards of decency, fairness, and integrity. We try our best to ensure that these links are safe for children, but the privacy and data collection practices on any linked websites are entirely separate from Kashi and are not covered by this Online Privacy Policy. Kashi shall not be responsible for any failure on the part of any linked websites to comply with any privacy policy posted on the website, or any contractual or other legal obligations to which the operators of such website may be subject. In addition, other websites, may also link to the Kashi websites without Kashi’s knowledge or consent. Kashi has no responsibility for the content, policies or actions of these websites.
