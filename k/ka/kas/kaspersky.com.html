<h3 id="O365"><a href="https://cloud.kaspersky.com/">Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365</a></h3>
<h3>Account Registration</h3>
<p>In order to use Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365 and have access to all of its functions, you will need to create a personal account, which requires you to provide us with your email address, company name, and password. You can use a Kaspersky Endpoint Security Cloud account. We will only process and use this information in order to provide you with the Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365 service, unless you expressly opt in to processing or use for other purposes (for example, to receive useful news on Kaspersky Lab products and services via email). The email address specified during registration will be used for notifications related to provision of the Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365 service, including to inform you when the service is unavailable, when the trial period expires, or when updates have been released.</p>
<h3>Account settings</h3>
<p>You may review, update or correct your account data, password and preferences or even delete your account any time using "Account Settings" function.</p>
<h3>Configuring the service</h3>
<p>The Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365 service is integrated directly with Office 365, which requires access to Exchange Online.</p>
<p>If you choose automatic configuration, the service asks you for Global Admin credentials. The Service does not save this data in any form, but instead uses it only for initial configuration and creation of a special account for email protection.</p>
<p>If you choose manual configuration, Global Admin credentials are not required, and the special account for email protection is created manually by the administrator.</p>
<h3>Service operation</h3>
<p>During operation, the Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365 service receives messages and other objects (meetings, tasks, etc.) to be scanned, and they are processed according to the protection settings. Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365 does not save messages or objects requiring scanning in its infrastructure.</p>
<p>The list of data that may be accessed by the Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365 service as well as the data that is collected during operation of the service is presented in the documentation section "About data provision".</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>If you request support from our Technical Support or Virus Lab team using our technical support services, we will ask you for the information that we need in order to help you, such as your registration/license number, email address, data of the product and service related to your problem, information about your computer hardware and software, and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. Furthermore, it may be helpful or even necessary for this purpose to send us files you are experiencing problems with via Company Account "upload" function. These may also contain personal information, such as user specific or otherwise personally identifiable file names, meta data or contents. It is of course always your choice whether you want to upload files or not.</p>
<h3 id="VirusDesk"><a href="https://virusdesk.kaspersky.com/">Kaspersky Lab VirusDesk</a></h3>
<p>Kaspersky VirusDesk is a web page designed to scan files and URLs for viruses and provide you with scanning results, to help us improve our detection methods in your best interest and at the same time provide you with additional information regarding any files or URLs that might in fact either be:</p>
<ol>
<li>a) malicious, but which Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus software has not detected and/or rated as malicious (“Infected”), or</li>
<li>b) clean, but which Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus software has erroneously rated as malicious (“False Alarm”).</li>
</ol>
<p>For this purpose, Kaspersky VirusDesk allows you to upload a file (of up to 50 MB of size) to our servers or to provide us with a URL address to have them checked for known potential malware infection and to allow our experts at Kaspersky Anti-Virus Lab to perform further scans and analyses of the content in that regard.</p>
<p>We at Kaspersky Lab respect your desire to protect personal information. Therefore, we will only gather and use personal information required for a full-scale operation of Kaspersky Virus Desk.</p>
<p>You make all decisions regarding whether or not to provide personal data. However, please note that if you do not wish to provide the necessary information, you may not be able to use Kaspersky Virus Desk. For example, if a file you want to upload for scanning contains personal data, it is solely your responsibility to assess and decide whether you want to and are allowed to share the data with us. We at Kaspersky Lab will solely use such data for the purpose of scanning and analyzing it for possible malware infection, but we cannot take responsibility regarding your right to share them with us in the first place.</p>
<p>If you like to receive feedback regarding the possible malware infection of information you have provided to us, you can enter your e-mail address after clicking on “I want to get check results by email”. We will use your e-mail address in order to provide you with such results and to provide you with customer support services based on your previous requests.</p>
<h3 id="CompanyAccount"><a href="https://companyaccount.kaspersky.com/">Kaspersky CompanyAccount</a></h3>
<h3>Account registration</h3>
<p>To use CompanyAccount and access all of its features, you must create:</p>
<ul>
<li>personal account</li>
<li>an account for your company, unless your coworkers have done this previously</li>
</ul>
<p>This will require that you provide your corporate e-mail address (which will be your username), password, first and last name, company name and country, and your company's license to use Kaspersky Lab applications. We will process and use this information solely for the purpose of providing you with CompanyAccount services and technical support, unless you explicitly choose to have it processed and used for other purposes. After registration your personal account will be linked to your company's account.</p>
<p>If your company's account was previously created, then your registration information (first and last name and corporate e-mail address) will be sent to the CompanyAccount Administrator from your company. The company employee who first registers the company and a personal account is typically designated as the Administrator.</p>
<h3>Account settings</h3>
<p>You can at any time view, update, correct your account information and password, or delete your account on the "My account" tab. After your account is deleted, your data will be stored by Kaspersky Lab in order to improve customer service, but your ability to access CompanyAccount using that account will be blocked.</p>
<p>Your company's CompanyAccount Administrator will also be able to change your account settings and reset your password.</p>
<p>If you are your company's CompanyAccount Administrator, then you have the ability to edit personal accounts for all of your colleagues and block the entire company's account (employees' personal accounts will remain in the system).</p>
<h3>Licenses</h3>
<p>You can add and view your company's licenses to Kaspersky Lab products on the "Licenses" tab of your CompanyAccount (activation codes or key files for each product). The license provided during registration will be added automatically to your company's CompanyAccount.</p>
<p>Key files are not physically stored on CompanyAccount. The system only stores a record about your company's license.</p>
<p>Every company employee with a personal account linked to your company's CompanyAccount has access to the list of licenses.</p>
<p>Your CompanyAccount Administrator can remove your company's licenses by deleting them from the list.</p>
<h3>Contracts</h3>
<p>If your company purchases additional customer support services, then after the purchase has been recorded you will be able to view the list of purchases services on the "Contracts" tab.</p>
<p>The list of contracts will be available to those company employees who were designated as authorized to use the paid service at the time of purchase. These people will automatically receive notifications about the expiration of the contract.</p>
<h3>Customer support requests</h3>
<p>If you contact Customer Support or the Anti-Virus Lab team for support through CompanyAccount, we may ask you to submit information we may require for providing assistance to you. For example, this may include information about the product associated with your request, computer hardware, your company's network, software, and the nature of the problem you've encountered. Moreover, it may be helpful or even necessary for you to send us the files you are having trouble with or files that define the configuration of your computer or network. You can do this by using the "Attach files" option in the request form. These files may contain user-specific or otherwise personally-identifiable file names, metadata, or content.It is always your choice whether to upload these files. If you would like to upload files, please first view and accept our <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/support/rdp?cid=ca&amp;utm_source=companyaccount.kaspersky.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=company_account&amp;utm_content=en">Regulation on data provisioning</a> on the file upload page.</p>
<p>In order to choose the correct customer support department for your request, we will use information about your company's licenses, country, and possibly the interface language selected in your CompanyAccount.</p>
<p>Your colleagues may have access to your requests if your CompanyAccount Administrator manually changes the corresponding settings (the Administrator can view requests automatically). Access to requests is not limited in time, but the files you upload may be deleted six months after your request is closed.</p>
