Kashoo web sites may contain links to other web sites. Kashoo is not responsible for the information practices or the content of such other web sites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other web sites to understand their information practices.</p>
<p><strong>2. Personal Information Collected</strong><br>
Kashoo offers a variety of services that are collectively referred to as the “Service.” Kashoo collects information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web sites (“Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Service (“Customers”).</p>
<p>When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Service or registering to use the Service, Kashoo requires you to provide the Company with contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address (“Required Contact Information”). When purchasing the Service, Kashoo requires you to provide the Company with financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, and credit card number (“Billing Information”). Kashoo may also ask you to provide additional information, such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry (“Optional Information”). Required Contact Information, Billing Information, and Optional Information are referred to collectively as “Data About Kashoo Customers.”</p>
<p>As you navigate Kashoo.com, Kashoo may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information gathering tools, such as cookies and web beacons (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on the Company’s web sites (such as the web pages viewed and the links clicked).</p>
<p><strong>3. Use of Information Collected</strong><br>
The Company uses Data about Kashoo Customers to perform the services requested. For example, if you fill out a “Contact Me” Web form, the Company will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Service.</p>
<p>The Company may also use data about Kashoo Customers for marketing purposes. For example, the Company may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in Kashoo.com, the Service, and to send you information regarding the Company and its partners, such as information about promotions or events.</p>
<p>Kashoo uses credit card information solely to check the financial qualifications of prospective Customers and to collect payment for the Service.</p>
<p>Kashoo uses Web Site Navigational Information to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites. The Company may also use Web Site Navigational Information in combination with Data about Kashoo Customers to provide personalized information about the Company.</p>
<p><strong>4. Web Site Navigational Information</strong><br>
Kashoo uses commonly-used information gathering tools, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web sites (“Web Site Navigational Information”) . This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information the Company may collect and how the Company may use this information.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
Kashoo uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, Kashoo’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Kashoo, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a web form (such as a “Contact Me” or a “30 Day Free Trial” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company.<br>
There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.</p>
<p>If you have chosen to identify yourself to Kashoo, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Service, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed in your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Service and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Service.<br>
Kashoo uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web sites. When you purchase the Service or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s web sites, but you will not be able to successfully use the Service.</p>
<p>Kashoo may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Kashoo Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>
Kashoo uses web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular web site tied to the web beacon, and a description of a web site tied to the web beacon. For example, Kashoo may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web sites. Kashoo uses web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s web sites and email communications. Kashoo may use information from web beacons in combination with Data About Kashoo Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Service.</p>

<p>Kashoo reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information of the Company’s Customers or Visitors if required by law or if the Company reasonably believes that disclosure is necessary to protect the Company’s rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p>

<p><strong>9. Customer Data</strong><br>

<a name="secure"></a><p><strong>10. Security</strong><br>
Kashoo uses robust security measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of Customer Data. When the Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology protects Customer Data using both server authentication and data encryption. These technologies help ensure that Customer Data is safe, secure, and only available to the Customer to whom the information belongs and those to whom the Customer has granted access. Kashoo also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its web sites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Kashoo also offers enhanced security features within the Service that permit Customers to configure security settings to the level they deem necessary.</p>
