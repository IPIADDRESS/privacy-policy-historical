GTGI PRIVACY POLICY and YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
This Privacy Policy does not cover the “Ask the Experts” advertising feature or “My Capture” service for user generated content that may be offered on this web channel.  Please see the separate privacy policies for Ask the Experts and My Capture. <br><br>

At Gray Television Group, Inc.

This Privacy Policy applies to those web channels for GTGI television stations (“Stations”) that are part of the GTGI Network. For a list of those web channels, <b><a href="http://media.graytvinc.com/video/GrayTelevision_InteractiveMap05.swf" target="_blank">Click Here.</a></b>   This Privacy Policy governs the collection of any Personal Information you provide to a GTGI web channel that is part of the GTGI Network and does not cover any such information collected by its corporate parent, affiliates, or any other company, unless specifically stated. This Privacy Policy is also incorporated into the GTGI Legal Terms for Web Channel Usage Agreement (“Terms of Use”) by reference. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Use.  <br><br>

Unless specified otherwise on the Service, all users must be at least 18 years of age and a legal resident of the United States to participate in any activity that requires the submission of Personal Information.  This Service is designed and targeted to United States (“U.S.”) audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S.  We make no representation that this Service is operated in accordance with the laws or governed by other nations.  By your participation in our Service activities, you certify that you are at least 18 years of age and located in the U.S.  If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you participate in activities on this Service contrary to our policy that only U.S. residents are eligible for certain activities, you do so at your own risk and initiative, and are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws.  Please be aware that any Personal Information you voluntarily submit to us will be transferred to the U.S and subject to U.S. law.  By using this Service, participating in any Service activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to this collection, transfer and use of Personal Information to the U.S., and waive any claims that may arise under your own national laws.  
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time without notice to you, so please check back often. Certain revisions are effective to you as a user of this web channel immediately upon posting. When we revise the Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on the web channel’s home page.  For revisions that are classified as significant changes in the use and disclosure of your information we will also send a notice to your email address currently on file with GTGI, and meet any other requirement under applicable law.  If you have any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us by sending an e-mail message to lisa.bishop@gray.tv.

What are “Your California Privacy Rights”?
Under California law, California residents who have an established business relationship with us will have the right to receive information about our opt-out policy of sharing your Personal Information with GTGI corporate affiliated companies (collectively, “GTGI Affiliates”) and with non-affiliated third parties, including Advertisers, for marketing purposes. If you wish to learn about our opt-out policies and your rights under California law, please send your written request to us using the email or postal mail address below.  In an email request, you must state “Re: Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject line.  


<br><br>


Gray Television Group, Inc.
Attn: Lisa Bishop/Your California Privacy Rights
Vice President Internet Operations &amp; New Media 
126 N. Washington Street
Albany, GA 31701
<br><br>

For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state and zip code. We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for responding to requests that are not labeled or not sent properly, or do not have complete information.
Your request to opt-out of our future sharing of your Personal Information with either GTGI Affiliates or third parties will be processed within ten (10) business days of the date it is received in accordance with the information below. Please note that non-affiliated third parties are independent from GTGI and if you wish to stop all communications from such third parties, you will need to address your request to the non-affiliated third parties directly.

<br><br>

1.	Collection of Personal Information
You do not need to provide any Personal Information (which is information that can identify you or can be used to contact you) to use a GTGI web channel or to obtain information from most of the features and activities of a GTGI web channel. In general, you can visit our web channels without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information.
However, if you want to participate in certain online services, you may be asked to provide some Personal Information, such as your name, mailing address, business address, telephone, mobile phone, birth date or age, and/or e-mail address.  You might be asked to choose a user name and password, and provide that information when accessing certain online features or services. If you do not want to give us any Personal Information, you can always choose not to participate.  The choice is yours. We are only interested in offering you convenient online services that match your interests and needs.
Unless stated otherwise, we do not purposefully request contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “.net” or “.com”) as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent. We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial email.  We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name as such messages are not deemed to be commercial email and therefore, are not regulated by Federal law.  However, when “computer to phone” commercial emails are prohibited by law, we may reject your wireless device contact information when such information is submitted for certain features or services.  We will attempt to notify you if we will need new contact information.  All users of the Service are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false or fraudulent. Any prize or benefit shall be forfeited due to a rejected or disqualified entry.  
Your continued participation indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.   We may from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format. We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from Advertisers, or marketing companies.  This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Service or a participant in Station activities.  
The list below contains some of the instances when a GTGI web channel, one of its operational service providers or vendors (third party companies that provide internal support to the Service) may collect your Personal Information. Please note that many of our web channels may offer additional online features and services and may ask you to provide some Personal Information before permitting you to access those areas. 

<br><br>


Automated News Services and Updates.  This Service may offer you special subscription features for news and news-related topics: 1) “E-News,” “E-Sports,” or “E-Weather” provides news, sports, and weather updates, respectively, via email; and 2) the “First Alert” feature provides weather information at your desktop.  For the email updates, you are only required to submit an email address.  To subscribe to the First Alert feature, you are required to provide your first and last name, zip code, email address, location of the email address, gender, and birth date.  The submission of other information such as your computer’s operating system, ranges for household income and education, and a general description of your profession is voluntary.

<br><br>


Polls. Many GTGI web channels offer polling areas, which provide users with an opportunity to vote on local and national issues of concern. When you choose to participate in a poll, we may ask you to provide your name, gender, age or birth date, zip code and/or e-mail address. This information helps us to ensure the accuracy of our polling data.

<br><br>


Surveys. GTGI web channels also may allow users to complete surveys about products or services offered by GTGI or other companies. These surveys may ask for your name and e-mail address, and/or other information, such as your gender, age or birth date and income level. This information helps us to understand our survey results.

<br><br>


Contests/Trivia. GTGI web channels also afford users many opportunities to play contests or trivia games. When you enter into a contest, trivia game or any other promotional opportunity, we may ask for your name, password information, and telephone number and address (physical and electronic) so that we can contact you if you win. Sometimes we may require you to provide additional information, such as your birth date, gender and income level. Of course, if you do not want to provide such information, you do not need to participate in the online activity.

<br><br>


Purchases &amp; Shopping. Some GTGI web channels enable users to purchase products. When you purchase products, we may request your name, billing and/or shipping address, email address, telephone number and credit card information. This information allows us to send you the items you ordered, to process payment information, and to respond to product and billing questions.  Credit card or debit card account information will be collected via a secured transmission process and will be stored in a commercially reasonable secured manner.  Alternatively, the Service may use a third party operational service provider to conduct the financial transaction in a secured manner; the third party payment website will be accessible via a hyperlink from the GTGI Network Station’s web channel and will be solely responsible for all financial transactions and the collection, use, storage and disposal of your Personal Information.

<br><br>


Chat/Message Boards/Blogs. GTGI web channels also may offer users the chance to participate in public areas, such as chat rooms, message boards, blogs and/or news groups. When you choose to participate in any of these areas, we may request your name, password information and address (physical and electronic). This information helps us respond to questions or concerns about use of these public areas.  We reserve the right to edit or delete any Personal Information disclosed to the public.

<br><br>


Comments/Questions.  We afford users an opportunity to submit comments or questions online. You must provide, at minimum, your name to submit a comment or question, in some instances email address is optional.  If you choose to provide other Personal Information with, or in your comment or question, we may retain such information in our public correspondence files unless you are identified as a person less than 13 years of age. General correspondence received from children identified as being less than 13 years of age will be deleted and destroyed consistent with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”).  However, GTGI Stations are obligated by the Federal Communications Commission to maintain certain public correspondence related to the operations of the Station in its public inspection file, which may also be available via a Station’s web channel.  Such correspondence will be maintained in the GTGI network Stations’ public inspection file and made available for review by the general public as required by the FCC, even such correspondence knowingly received from children. 

<br><br>


2.	Use and Disclosure of Personal Information 
GTGI web channels use your Personal Information for three general purposes. First, we use the information to provide you with the services you request and to respond to billing and/or other questions related to such service offerings. Second, we use the information to understand your use of our web channels and to notify you about updates to one of our web channels or to send you marketing materials or promotional offers from the Service, GTGI Network Stations, or on behalf of our advertisers, sponsors, and promotional partners (collectively, “Advertisers”)  that may be of interest to you. Third, we may use this information in aggregate form to help us evaluate and modify existing services, and to help us develop additional services that are likely to be of interest to our users. 

<br><br>


We reserve the right to collect Personal Information using any new technology yet to be developed and to use such technology to provide new services and features to you, as well as for marketing and promotional purposes.  Specific information regarding your choice to Opt-out to such use, or for sharing your Personal Information with Advertisers, will be provided once the new technology, service, or feature is introduced. 

<br><br>


On occasion, GTGI or one of its Network Stations may share your Personal Information with our Advertisers. You will have an opportunity to “Opt-out” of such sharing at the time of registration for the event or feature or by contacting the Service at [LISA – INSERT PROPER EMAIL ADDRESS FOR A PERSON TO OPT-OUT].  

<br><br>


We also provide you with an option to “Opt-out” of receiving advertising and promotional email from us about GTGI, its Stations or our Advertisers in compliance with federal law by installing an Opt-out mechanism with all such commercial email messages. You must use the designated method in the email message to notify us of your Opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other methods of notification will be effective or timely.  Please be aware that we may continue to contact you via email for administrative, transactional or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken.  By law, such messages are not considered to be commercial email.

<br><br>


We are not responsible for removing your Personal Information from third party lists or entities which you have previously authorized us to share your information.  You will need to contact those entities directly. 
We may also share aggregate Personal Information and non-Personal Information about website usage with unaffiliated third parties, including, but not limited to, government agencies, Advertisers, and the media (i.e., __% of GTGI users are female, __% of users have visited certain sections, etc.). This aggregate information does not contain any Personal Information about a specific individual. 

<br><br>


We may share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties in limited instances. For example, we may share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties as is necessary to process or collect payments, or service registered-user accounts. We also may hire third party technology providers to host the GTGI Network and to store your Personal Information. 

<br><br>


In the event that the assets or stock of the Service, GTGI, its Network Stations, and GTGI’s parent company are sold or transferred, merged with a different company or entity, restructured, or subject to other fundamental corporate changes, we reserve the right to disclose any and all databases compiled from Personal Information.  We will seek to obligate the company’s successor to agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy, as it may hereafter be modified, but cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so or that the successor company will comply with this obligation.  

<br><br>


Finally, we may be required to disclose Personal Information by law or legal process, to protect and defend the rights or property of a GTGI web channel, to respond to or participate in a governmental inquiry or investigation, or to protect the personal safety of users of our web channels. We also reserve the right to contact appropriate authorities when activities that are illegal (or reasonably presumed to be illegal) or violate our policies is taking place on a GTGI web channel. 
Except under the limited circumstances described above, we will not disclose any of your Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties.

<br><br>


3.	How We Protect Personal Information
We take reasonable measures to protect the privacy, accuracy, and reliability of any information you choose to provide and to protect such information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Only authorized employees are permitted to access Personal Information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. Any employee who violates our privacy access policies will be subject to disciplinary action. 

<br><br>


However, please note that this Service does not use a secured connection for the transmission of Personal Information except for the purchase of goods and services. When a user transmits Personal Information over an unsecured Internet connection, Personal Information during the transmission such as your email or registration could be copied or intercepted by unknown third parties.  Therefore, you understand, acknowledge and agree that you transmit certain Personal Information over this Service at your own risk.  

<br><br>


4.	Accessing or Deleting Your Personal information
If you have submitted Personal Information through a GTGI web channel and you would like to access that information, please send an e-mail to rstora@gcslink.com. We will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and to correct any factual inaccuracies that you identify. Upon your request, we also will remove your Personal Information from our active databases. Given the limitations of our computer systems, corporate business policies, and federal or state laws, we may not be able to delete all of your Personal Information. We reserve the right to deny access to any user if we believe there is a question about his/her identity. And if the burden or expense of providing access to a user’s Personal Information is disproportionate to the potential privacy risks to that user, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may chose to not provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation and a contact person for further inquiries. 

<br><br>


5.	Collection, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personal Information 
GTGI web channel may collect and freely disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable, as described in the next two sections below.  We reserve the right to merge any such information with your Personal Information but will do so only in accordance with GTGI guidelines and applicable law.

<br><br>


6.	Internet Protocol Addresses 
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. This number by itself does not identify your name, e-mail address or other Personal Information. If you request pages from any GTGI web channel, that web channel's server will enter your IP address into a log. To maintain user anonymity, GTGI does not associate or link IP addresses with records containing Personal Information unless it is necessary to enforce the law, our Terms of Use, protect GTGI, its users, employees, operational service providers or Advertisers, or to defend against or investigate any charges or claims against GTGI. We also do not permit IP addresses to be associated and viewed with posts to chat rooms, blogs and bulletin boards by other users. We store IP addresses for a period of time to help us to identify anyone who refuses to comply with our Terms of Service, applicable law, and to identify visitors who threaten our Service, web channel, customers or others. We also will use this information to measure web channel traffic for purposes of system administration and for our Advertisers. This aggregate data also helps us to understand how people are using the web channel and helps us improve your online experience. 

<br><br>


7.	Passive Collection of User Information via Cookies and Web Beacons 
GTGI web channels passively collect certain kinds of non-Personal information automatically through the use of "cookies."  "Cookies" are small text files that recognize repeat visitors, facilitate ongoing access and personalization to some of our features and activities and other websites, and will allow us to understand how and when pages are visited and by how many people. Cookies can store a variety of information, including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer times, user preferences, shopping cart information and passwords needed to access our web channels and Service.  We use cookies to make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. We may also use cookies to serve customized advertising or content to you based on your geographic location, age, gender, or other demographics that you have provided to us and to ensure the accuracy of our polling data. You may configure your browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent.  If you do not want to allow our cookies on your computer, you must configure your browser to turn off all cookies used by GTGI, our system does not allow you to opt-out to them individually.  However, if you do so, you might not be able to access important functions or enjoy certain conveniences or customized features of our Service.

8.	Safeguarding Children's Privacy 
GTGI web channels will not knowingly collect Personal Information or any other identifying data from children under 13 years of age without first obtaining verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian. Requests for parental consent will explain how we collect, use, and disclose children's Personal Information, and will include an opportunity for parents to prevent use of their children's Personal Information, as well as to prevent their children from participating in features which involve the collection of Personal Information. In addition, if/when we request Personal Information from children less than 13 years of age with verifiable parental consent, we will not require the child to disclose more Personal Information than is necessary in order to participate in any online feature or service. 

<br><br>


Should a child whom we know to be under 13 submit Personal Information to a GTGI web channel without first obtaining verifiable parental consent, we will immediately reject any such entry and delete that information from our database, unless such information meets an exception under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or pertains to the programming or operations of GTGI Network Stations and therefore, will be subject to the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  We are required by the FCC to post any such emailed comments on this web channel. (See above Comments/Question Section.)

<br><br>


Except to meet FCC, other regulatory and legal purposes, we will not use, distribute or disclose any child's Personal Information to third parties without prior parental consent. Unless we are required to retain any Personal Information for regulatory, tax or other legal purposes we will promptly remove such information from our database if a parent withdraws his or her consent to our use or maintenance of Personal Information collected from his or her child.

<br><br>


9.	External Links 
GTGI web channels may provide links to various external websites or services (collectively referred to as a “Linked Website”). (Please see the Service’s Legal Terms for Web Channel Use Agreement for more information.) When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred from a GTGI web channel and connected to the service or website of the third party organization or company that you selected. Even if an affiliation exists between GTGI and a third party Linked Website, you understand, acknowledge and agree that GTGI exercises no control and has no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or business practices of a Linked Website. Each of these Linked Websites (such as “Ask the Experts” and “My Capture”) maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. If you visit a website that is linked to a GTGI web channel, you should consult that website's privacy policy before providing those websites with any of your Personal Information. 

<br><br>


10.	Framed Websites/Pages
The Service may also include certain pages that are “framed” and link to third party websites (“Framed Pages”). We provide these Framed Pages as a convenience to our users. A Framed Page may have the same look and feel as other pages on the Service, with a GTGI or Network Station logo and border, but Framed Pages are often merely gateways to other websites.  Even if an affiliation exists between GTGI and a Framed Page, you understand, acknowledge and agree that GTGI exercises no control over Framed Pages, and GTGI is not responsible for any content or the privacy policies or data-collection practices of a Framed Page. The privacy policy of the Framed Page, if any, will control your use of, and provision of information to or through, the Framed Page. If you visit a Framed Page, you should consult the Framed Page’s privacy policy before providing any Personal Information.  

<br><br>


11.	Terms, Changes and Questions 
By using a GTGI web channel, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the web channel or disclose any Personal Information.   
If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the web channel’s home page. We will also notify you of significant changes via email (if we have your current email address).  If you do not agree to the changes in the Privacy Policy, you understand, acknowledge and agree that your only recourse is to stop using our Service, and your continued use of our Service constitutes acceptance of such changes in the Privacy Policy, except where further steps are required by applicable law. The effective date of this Privacy Policy is noted in the beginning of this Privacy Policy.

<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">THIS IS A NO BRAINER!
If the officer asks you to do something like ..DON'T GET BACK IN YOU'RE CAR!!!YOU DO IT!
Anyone that has an arguement with this is simply a MORON!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Anonym</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Police shouldn't have tasers.  They kill people!  What is wrong with you people?  Jesus, I suppose if she said "shoot me" it would have been okay?  My god!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: B-Thug</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">I woulda tased her too. Just cause she's old don't mean she can disrespect the law .Anyway, she shoulda blocked it with her prune.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: T.</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">At age 72, she should know better than to behave that way.  Age is not a reason to let people get away with those kind of actions!  Shame on her...I hope her grandchildren weren't watching!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Rock the Boat</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">ElizabethW: I would be surprised if you have not been tased! As it appears you are capable of blurting out just about anything, at anytime! Thanks for reading my comment.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Susan</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">The taser was not the correct way to go?  Yes, it would have been so much better to allow her to walk into traffic, causing possibly not only her death, but possibly hurt or kill someone else trying to avoid her.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: anonymous</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Maybe I've watched too many episodes of COPS, but I say I'd rather have my grandma tased than thrown down on the ground, which would likely result in worse injuries (broken bones, abrasions to the face, injury to existing conditions (hip, shoulder, wrist), etc.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">She may have been wrong, but the taser was not a correct way to go. Maybe pepper spray, Just watch - it will come out that she had heart problems and that this act could have been fatal.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Jamie</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">I'm going to bet she didn't count on him having a camera on his car. Nothing like having proof that you were out of line. I wonder if she tried that "a 72 year old woman!" crap on other officers and got away with it because they DIDN'T have a camera to prove she was out of line?</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: regular guy</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Has anyone seen the video? she comes right out and say "tase me"... She got what she asked for , the officer was in the right, end of story.  Just because you're older doesn't give the right to ignore an officer.  Anyone see how she was in the media before talking about how she has done nothing wrong, then when the video comes out nobody hears from her? She knows she was in the wrong too</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">CRAVEN what are you talking about this was an old women what you would tase an old women? because if you would then beelzebub would have you for breakfast muhahaha</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: nonya</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">she should be thankful he had a taser.. she could have been shot or beat with a club. Don't be an idiot and do what u r told.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: ElizabethW</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">She broke the law and resisted arrest.  Maybe the taser was extreme, but she wouldn't let him handcuff her.  He did everything he was supposed to.  I saw the video on GMA.  Funny how she did nothing wrong, but as soon as the tape is released, she clammed up, and lawyered up.  Sounds guilty to me.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Dana</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">This officer had no tact. Had he used his head he might have diffused the situation through calmly talking to the woman before it got to this point, Officers today have no common sense anymore. They are over-sized gorrillas with a Billy Bad-Ass w/Badge attitude. Also as small as she was, it did not warrent the use of the tazer. If she had a pacemaker or difibulator it would have killied her. Officers need to start using their heads.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Doesn't matter what her age is or whether she is male or female.  She was way over the speed limit, abusive, trying to get back in her truck so she got what she deserved.  She even tried to use her age and being female to dare him to tase her.  She knew what she was doing, but thought that being old and female would work in her favor.  She was wrong.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Paul</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">The officer should have kept the door closed. HE knew they were in the heat of the moment and she was upset. The age might matter, yet the point is that the officer depended on the use of a taser to solve a problem instead of critically analyzing the situation and finding a peaceful solution. The officer invited trouble by putting the citizen in harms way by opening the door knowing she would be aggressive. It seems there is much more to improve in training officers to be leaders than depending on violence. Luckily both were fine. But I would hold the officer accountable for the lack of handling that situation properly and in the manner that badge speaks for leadership, honor, respect and service to the community. Though the citizen was upset and angry there were better ways in solving that situation.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: cas</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">It doesnt matter how old you are, or what your size is... if you do not obey the law and THEN you do not obey the police officer.. you deserve something like this to happen.  You do not have "special" rights based on age, gender, or size.  Had this happened at a remote area, with no traffic, I am sure the officer would have never used the taser. But she was so angry, that she did not know where she was on the highway and she did not realize how close she was getting to the highway traffic.  He had to subdue her as quick as possible, or risk her getting hit by a car.  Had he tried to "handle" her in a physical way, and tried to arrest her, they both could have easily ended up in the highway.  This old lady was more than willing to share her side of the story, doing many interviews.  But since the police released the video, she has declined every other interview and has made no comment.  I wonder why she shut up so fast after the video was released?  hmmmm... interesting!!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Okay to everyone who thinks she didn't deserve to have the taser used on her.  I'm not in LE, but heck.  If anyone resists arrest at all, I beleive in wichita if you fail to comply after given a verbal command, you get a taser pulled on you, if you fail to comply twice, you will get a nice reminder from the taser.  He had the cuffs out, she was resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, and if she was 30 not a single one of you would say a dang thing about it unless you are already against the use of force, but before tasers, she probably would've been forced to the ground then arrested.  Watch the video, she denied his report, but once the video became public, no one has heard a thing from her.  She knows she was out of line and so now she knows it's best to shut her mouth like everyone saying the officer was wrong should.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Craven</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">you guys are funny! Because im sure the musuem in dc thought that 91 yr old man was harmless too! Hes 91 whats he gonna do? oh wait he killed someone. its called precaution, and if that old lady would have been hit by traffic, you all would be saying "why didnt that officer do anything, he new she was old"</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: mr ed</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">would anyone expect less from a state that has a express lane for the death penalty I say hats off to the officer</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: jasper</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">He was in the right for the simple fact that she was putting the cop and herself in danger of being hit by a car. using a taser was the best option in this situation.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Johanna</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">yes, the officer had the right to do it. but come on, seriously, tazin the old woman could do serious harm...lol.. sometimes i would like to taze some 72 year olds i know of..haha</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: anonymous</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">wtf? are you serious? a 72 year old? come on!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Keri</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">The officer was in the right in this case.  She was very aggressive, verbally abusive, and every step she took towards them also pushed them towards heavy traffic. If it had been a drag out fight the might have ended up IN traffic.  She was that feisty I can see it probably happening if he hadn't have tased her.  It was for her safety as well as his.  You need to look at the whole picture instead of the age of the woman.  That could have turned more dangerous for both of them.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: amanda</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">She was totally out of line, and the officer was just trying to protect her from what could have been fatal~she could have been hit by a car.  And she doesn't even have the decency to thank him from protecting her from herself and her actions.  This officer not only deserves to not be punished, but deserves a metal.</span></li>

<li><span class="title">Posted By: virgil</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">The police officer should have been able to handle a 72 year old lady. there was no need to taser her. I don't care what the book say's. If he can't handle a 72 year old lady find a different job.</span></li>

<li><span class="title">Posted By: Susan</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">This woman clearly has anger issues.    But of course, since she is elderly, she thinks she deserves special rights.  If this police officer had done anything else to retrain her, she still will be crying police brutality.  After viewing this video, the only people who believe the officer was wrong obviously are ones who already hate the police. Of course, now that she has had her publicity, she will sue and some idiot judge will award her millions of dollars.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: cw</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">The policeman is right.  She could have been hit by a passing car. She needs to go to driver  rehab classes for the elderly too.</span></li>

<li><span class="title">Posted By: Anon.</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">The woman is being a complete jerk.  I don't care if she is 72 - she thinks she is exempt from the law.  Better to taze her down then tackle her and break something.  She survived and I think she's shutting her mouth now.</span></li>

whats next, tasing a baby because it wouldnt wuit crying?


Hey shut up</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: sEAN</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">I don't normally like cops, espicially authority hungry ones, but this guy gave her what she had coming. I've been tased (voluntarily) and let me tell you, if a cop threatens to use it, obey his commands. It's not fun.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: cliff</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">anonomous at 1;24, you are obviously a cop.  the job of police isnt to punish the guilty, thats the jpb of the court and prisons. she deserved it? yah sure. you do more.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">It doesn't matter how old you are, if you are behind the wheel, can't obey the law and won't listent to law enforcement, you need tased.  Period.  Got what she deserved.  Shut your mouth, sign your ticket, like the rest of us who speed.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Anonymous</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">O.k. I first said he wasn't justified in using the Taser, but she is going way too close to traffic and acting really aggressive...if he had put her into a hold he probably would have gotten into more trouble. She was out of line, and just because she is 72 years old and a female doesn't make it right... Had she not been coming at him towards traffic he might have been able to reason with her more, but she was not listening to him at all and in a sense was protecting the situation from escalating out of control. I do however, think a more verbally gifted cop might have handled this better because with irrational people it is best to stay super calm and not "up the ante" so to speak.
I think the shove got her dander up and made the situation escalate.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: grag</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">The video was of a 72 year old woman being tasered. The incident seemingly started as a routine traffic stop, then escalated to the officer tasering the ...
See a video here:<a href="http://malecafe.net/video/index.php?q=72-year-old-woman-tasered"><strong>72 year old woman tasered</strong></a></span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">ol grandma</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">that old bag looked like she needed a good tasen</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">I think that is the most rediculious thing I have ever seen from a police office. He could have simply taken her to jail with out all that mess happening. How sad that a officer who is supposed to protect and serve would use such force for such a petty act of anger from such a small person. It is very visable from the way he yelled at her in the beginning of the video he has some control issues. I am all for taser guns when it is necessary, however, this was not one of those cases. The lady elderly or not should have complied but that kind of force was not necessary at all.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Lindsey</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">She was extremely out of line - she was pushing her way around him to get back into the car...using vulgar language that had to be beeped out.  We have a whole generation of youth that have no respect for authority and this grandma is a great example of why!  I think it is quite pathetic that a 72 yr woman was that disrespectful to an officer. our society gives more rights to criminals.  This woman clearly would not have allowed him to arrest her with the way she was pushing him around.  But if he would have man handled her to arrest - that would have looked bad on him, too?!  I think she fully deserved being tasered especially since he warned he that he would &amp; she still did not back down.  Kudos to the officer!  He should never have had to use the taser if she would have obeyed.  For those complaining about him not handling her did you watch?  If he would have cuffed her then you would be complaining he man-handled a grandma!?!  Why are you justifying actions of the guilty?</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: cliff</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">whats next, tasing a baby because it wouldnt wuit crying?</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Mary</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">The cop wasn't "defending" himself, he was following procedure. Where on earth is it ok for her to act that way? Jeezo Beezo - all he did was write her a ticket &amp; she refused to sign. WHY did she get out of her truck? She was WAY out of line!!! Let people act any way they want - let's just blame it all on the poor behavior of the police. If he had physically restrained her &amp; broken her arm because she is "72 years old" &amp; probably has brittle old bones then you all would have screamed police brutality. Just cause she is little &amp; old does not excuse her awful behavior.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: A</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">It was my understanding that a taser was suppose to be used in place of a gun so there might be less fatalities. So if the lady would said I dare you to shoot me would he have? First off, who was in charge, I don't feel the officer lost control of the situation, and next question is if the lady would have become combative, could the officer used physical force instead of a taser? I have to just laugh at this because both the woman and the officer made bad decisions. In his line of duty he should have better reasoning!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Jack</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">After she mentioned her age 10 times it becomes obvious she thinks she has certain rights because of that age. Follow the law lady! And then she denied any wrong doing until the tape came out, then she clams up. She had no right to act that obnoxious, &amp; to excuse that behavior explains why our society is going downhill.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Bob</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Yes, she was out of line. This paltry cop should be fired for not being able to handle a 4'11" 72 year old lady without a taser. A 5'1" 105 pound bleach blond female cop could handle her without a taser.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Terry</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">This is another fine example of people letting their mouth over ride them! Had she been drinking or off her meds?! Sorry grandma you were asking for this!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: kansas</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">if you watch the video she was calling him names but she was not out of control. She never harmed him, or threaten to harm him. Looks like another instance of a cop with control issues. If you can not handle a 72yr old women who has a potty mouth maybe you should look for another job. Also just gave another citizen the reason to sue another police department.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Zack</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">At that age a thirty second choke hold would have been sufficent.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: cliff</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">did the big bad little old lady scare the poor little cop?
she could have been handled easily if the cop hadnt taken the easy way out with the taser.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: *</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Have you seen the dash cam footage of this?  She was out of line, BIGTIME!!!!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Elizabeth</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Which one was more foolish? Her or the cop? Which one was supposed to be in control of the situation?</span></li>
