Kakuro is like a crossword puzzle with numbers.  Each "word" must add up to the number provided in the clue above it or to the left.  Words can only use the numbers 1 through 9, and a given number can only be used once in a word.  Every <a href="http://www.kakuroconquest.com/">kakuro puzzle</a> has one and only solution, and can be solved through logic alone.<br><br><br>
