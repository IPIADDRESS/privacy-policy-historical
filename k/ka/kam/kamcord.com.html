This Site is operated by Kamcord and has been created to provide information about our company and services (our services, together with the Site, the "<b>Services</b>") to our Service visitors and users ("<b>you</b>" and/or "<b>your</b>"). This Privacy Policy sets forth Kamcord's policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data ("<b>Personal Data</b>") and other information, that is collected from visitors and users of the Services.

                        We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services.

                        When you interact with Kamcord through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Kamcord may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Kamcord's affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of users of our Services, the number of uploads or views of videos in connection with our Services, the number of visitors to each page of our Site and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.

                    <p class="legal-indent" style="margin: auto;">
                        In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services' features.

                        In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Kamcord Services, Kamcord often conducts research on its user demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Kamcord may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Kamcord may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

                    <p style="margin: auto;">
                        Kamcord uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem, or if you tag or otherwise associate any videos uploaded and made available through the Services with any Personal Data, we may use and publicly disclose that Personal Data in order to make such videos available through the Services. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Kamcord and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Kamcord Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Kamcord Services. Kamcord and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.

                        If Kamcord intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.

                        Kamcord, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions.

                        This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Kamcord other than Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Kamcord through the Services or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services, such as discussion forums (collectively, "Public Areas"), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Kamcord shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.

If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Kamcord through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

                        One of the special features of the Service is that it may allow you to enable or log in to the Services via various social networking services like Facebook ("Social Networking Service(s)"). By directly integrating these services, we make your online experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature, we may ask you to log into the relevant Social Networking Service. When you add a Social Networking Services account to the Service or log into the Service using your Social Networking Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Social Networking Service and your data contained within that Social Networking Service.  As part of such integration, the Social Networking Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to the Social Networking Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  However, please remember that the manner in which Social Networking Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Kamcord shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Networking Services that may be enabled within the Service.
