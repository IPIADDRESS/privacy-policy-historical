Health declaration:</strong> Students must report on their enrollment form any mental or physical illness, allergy, disability or condition that may interfere with their ability to successfully complete their program, that may impact the health and well-being of any other student, host or staff member, that may require monitoring, treatment or emergency intervention of any kind during the student’s anticipated period of enrollment, or that may require special accommodations. Kaplan reserves the right to reject an applicant or terminate a student’s enrollment in the program if the student’s continued participation represents a risk to their health and safety or to the health and safety of other students or staff, or if, notwithstanding reasonable accommodations, in the opinion of Kaplan, the student’s physical or mental condition makes the student unable or unlikely to successfully complete their program. Refunds in such circumstances are at the discretion of Kaplan.</p>
						<p>USA: Some schools located on university campuses require students to provide a Health Declaration and Immunization form in advance of arrival. You will be informed in such cases.</p>
						<p><strong>7. Tuition fees:</strong> Tuition fees include lessons, orientation meeting, use of computer room and internet, placement and progress testing and a Kaplan certificate on completion of the course. Kaplan reserves the right to withhold the granting of a certificate attained by a student if tuition fees or any other fees remain outstanding, or other conditions are not met.</p>
						<p><strong>8. Additional services:</strong> Any additional services (transfers, travel, laundry, telephone costs, excursions, medical costs, special diet, exam fees, change of accommodation and enrollment amendments) are not included in any fees unless specifically stated on a valid invoice.</p>
						<p><strong>9. Twin accommodation:</strong> At Kaplan’s discretion, students may be required to book single room accommodation instead of twin room accommodation.</p>
						<p><strong>10. Under 18 year olds:</strong> Kaplan delivers adult courses (except for programs advertised as being for juniors or young learners). Therefore, students aged 16 and 17 are advised that they will be attending classes with students aged 18 and over. Under 18 year olds may be required to pay a guardian fee, provide custodianship documents, live in Kaplan-approved accommodation, book Kaplan’s airport transfer service (these are compulsory in Australia and New Zealand) and purchase Kaplan medical insurance. All students under 18 (under 19 for students attending our Vancouver location) must provide a signed Minor Authorisation form prior to arrival, and in Canada, students may need to provide a notarized Custodianship Declaration.</p>
						<p>UK/Ireland: The British and Irish governments require all students under 18 to submit a Waiver form and an Authorisation of Emergency Medical Treatment form which will be provided at the time of booking.</p>
						<h3><a id="s3" name="s3">Terms and Conditions</a></h3>
						<p><strong>1. Rules and regulations:</strong> Students’ arrangements with Kaplan are governed by the law of the country where the particular school attended is located.</p>
						<p><strong>2. Arrivals and departures:</strong> All accommodation is booked from the Saturday or Sunday before the course start date until the Saturday morning after the course end date, unless otherwise advised. A partial week may be counted as 1 week’s accommodation. Students arriving between 22:30 – 6:00 may be asked to book alternative accommodation in a hotel on their first night due to late/early arrival at accommodation, or be charged an extra night of accommodation.</p>
						<p><strong>3. Late arrivals, vacations and absences:</strong> If you begin your enrollment late or are absent during your course, no refund will be made for the time missed. Periods of absence cannot be made up with a free extension of the course. Session Break dates are pre-built into the Academic Year and Academic Semester programs and students cannot make changes to these dates. Breaks taken at other times will be marked as periods of absence. For other courses, granting of any Session Breaks after the course has started will be at the discretion of individual schools, according to visa regulations, and may incur a change fee or be marked as a period of absence.</p>
						<p><strong>4. Meals and classes missed:</strong> No refunds or substitutions will be made for meals or classes missed due to exams, excursions, internships, first day orientation or other obligations that fall outside the normal schedule.</p>
						<p><strong>5. Public holidays:</strong> Classes are normally not held and most school facilities are closed on public holidays. All published course start dates fall on a Monday. If the Monday is a public holiday, the start date will fall on a Tuesday. Compensation will not be made for classes not offered on public holidays.</p>
						<p><strong>6. Campus facilities:</strong> Students attending a Kaplan school at a university or college campus location are advised that campus facilities may not be available during campus holidays. Further details are available from the Kaplan booking office.</p>
						<p><strong>7. Change fees:</strong> A minimum of 4 weeks’ notice is required for any change. If you request a change of school location, course dates, accommodation or programme type after your course has started, you will be charged a change fee of GBP60, EUR85, USD100, CAD100, AUD75, NZD75 which is payable at the time the request is made. Kaplan is not obliged to fulfill any change request. Academic Year or Academic Semester students cannot transfer to a different Kaplan school during term time. If changing to a location where fees are lower, the difference in fees will not be refunded. If changing to a more expensive location or programme, the difference in fees will be charged. All changes are subject to Kaplan’s discretion and require approval of the Programme Director. You will not be charged a change fee if you extend your course, but late homestay extensions in Canada may require a re-placement fee of CAD100. It is the responsibility of the student to pay for any course or accommodation extensions. Any change of tuition resulting in a reduction in lessons will be treated as a termination of the existing booking and rebooking, and will thus be subject to the standard terms &amp; conditions governing terminations (see ‘Termination Policy’).&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>8. Duration of lessons:</strong> All English lessons are 45 minutes in duration unless otherwise stated. Courses run from Monday to Friday and lessons are scheduled in the morning or the afternoon. Kaplan cannot guarantee a specific timetable.</p>
						<p><strong>9. Substitution policy:</strong> If, after the placement test taken on arrival at the school, a student is found to be at a level which is not appropriate for their booked course, the school reserves the right to place the student in an appropriate level class, which may have fewer lessons and a different curriculum. Students who do not have the ability to follow any course on offer may be required to terminate their studies with Kaplan. We also reserve the right to cancel courses at short notice due to insufficient demand.</p>
						<p><strong>10. Programme changes:</strong> : Kaplan has the right to change course dates, course curricula, tutors, locations and programs at any time at its discretion. However, in cases where the course is rescheduled prior to the start of the first course and the new date is unacceptable to the student, all fees will be refunded.</p>
						<p><strong>11. Prices:</strong> Kaplan has the right to change prices due to tax increases, governmental actions or other events beyond Kaplan’s control. Prices are valid for courses starting in 2015.</p>
						<p><strong>12. Books and learning materials:</strong> All books and learning materials will be made available to students during their course. A book deposit (USD40) may be charged at the beginning of the course. This will be refunded at the end of the course, if the books are returned in good condition. Some specialized courses may require the purchase of books. In Canada, New Zealand and Australia a materials fee is charged to students to cover the cost of such items.</p>
						<p><strong>13. Residential housing deposit:</strong> A refundable housing deposit of up to GBP250, EUR350, USD500, CAD600, NZD250-500 or AUD250-500 may be charged on arrival to students taking residential accommodation in the UK, Ireland, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The deposit is returned unless there is damage, loss or extra cleaning to be paid for on the student’s departure. In some cases the deposit may be non-refundable if the booking is cancelled. Additional fees may also apply in some locations (e.g. utilities, cleaning, linen).</p>
						<p><strong>14. Expulsion/Suspension:</strong> Any student who commits a criminal offence, violates the student conduct code or school policy, has, in Kaplan’s opinion, a poor attendance record (whether or not such attendance is in breach of any visa attendance requirements), is absent for 14 consecutive days without notification (USA and Canada), or fails to pay an amount he or she is directly or indirectly liable to pay Kaplan in order to undertake the course, may be expelled or suspended. No refund will be given and the immigration authorities will be informed.</p>
						<p>Student Code of Conduct: You agree to abide by the student conduct rules and other policies while attending Kaplan. As part of Kaplan’s commitment to our students’ success, we seek to provide an optimal learning environment and expect students to conduct themselves in a manner that is considerate of those around them. Inappropriate conduct includes but is not limited to: (1) disruptions to the learning environment (i.e. use of profanity, harassment, mobile phone use in classrooms, etc.); (2) deliberate destruction, misuse, or theft of Kaplan property or the property of fellow classmates; (3) violence or threats of violence towards persons or property of students or Kaplan staff; (4) improper use of email or Internet access; and (5) failure to comply with local copyright or criminal laws forbidding the misappropriation, copying or alteration of copyright-protected materials.</p>
						<p><strong>15. Liability:</strong> The liability of Kaplan, its group companies, their directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents and partners with respect to losses arising from negligence (except where such liability cannot be excluded as a matter of law), breach of contract or otherwise will be limited in all circumstances to the full amount paid to Kaplan or the relevant Kaplan group company by the relevant student for the particular program. Such companies and persons will in no circumstances have any liability for indirect or consequential losses or damages.</p>
						<p><strong>16. Force majeure:</strong> Kaplan will not be liable in cases where Kaplan is unable to fulfil any services to which they are contractually bound because of fire, natural disaster, act of government, failure of suppliers or subcontractors, labour disputes or other reasons which are beyond Kaplan’s control.</p>
						<p><strong>17. Codes of practice:</strong> Kaplan has agreed to observe and be bound by the Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International Students published by the New Zealand Minister of Education and by the Australian National Code of Practice 2007 and the Educational Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (ESOS Act 2000). Information on these Codes is available on request from Kaplan or from: <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/">www.minedu.govt.nz</a> and <a href="http://www.aei.gov.au/">www.aei.gov.au</a>.</p>
						<p><strong>18. Photography, Filming and Sound Recording:</strong> Kaplan or its representatives may arrange to photograph or shoot video footage of students for promotional purposes, both printed and online. Any student who does not wish to participate should advise us at the time of booking and state at the time of the photographing or video shooting the wish not to participate. By accepting these terms and conditions the student (and their parent/guardian if under 18) gives consent to the use of these photographs or video footage without further consent or notification.</p>

All additional information and documents can be found on the Kaplan website: <a href="http://www.kaplaninternational.com">www.kaplaninternational.com</a></p>
						<p><strong>20. Student Visa Australia/UK/USA/Canada/New Zealand:</strong> Student visa holders are required to provide Kaplan with a current residential address and telephone number at all times, maintain satisfactory academic progress and attend a minimum of 80% of their course. Students who fail to show up for their enrollment or with less than 80% attendance, will be reported to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) in Australia, or to New Zealand Immigration Services. Regardless of immigration status, information collected by Kaplan which personally identifies a student and information regarding a student’s course progress may be shared with the Australian State and Federal government, designated authorities, the Tuition Protection Service (Australia), students’ parents, Kaplan staff and third-party representatives. This information may include personal and contact details, course enrollment details and changes, and circumstances of any suspected breach by the student of any visa condition. Any school-aged dependents accompanying overseas students to Australia will be required to pay full fees if they are enrolled in either a government or non-government school.</p>
						<p><strong>21. Language of instruction:</strong>All language of instruction shall be in English.</p>
						<p><strong>REFUND POLICY</strong>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Refunds will be made via the Kaplan representative to whom the fees were originally paid, or to the student’s bank account in the same country in which the fees were originally paid. All refunds will be made within 45 days of written notification (or according to state/provincial requirements). In the event of Kaplan cancelling or terminating a course, a full refund of all unused fees will be made.</p>
						<p>Australia: Refunds will be paid within 14 working days of written notification. In accordance with sections 27-31 of ESOS Act 2000, providing the student has not withdrawn before the default day, Kaplan will pay a full refund to the student within 14 days if the course being offered does not commence on the agreed starting day; or the course stops being provided at any time after it starts and before it is completed; or the course is not provided in full to the student because a sanction has been imposed on the college. This agreement, and the availability of complaints and appeals process, does not remove the right of the student to take action under Australia’s customer protection laws.</p>
						<p><strong>POSTPONEMENT POLICY</strong></p>
						<p>Postponements will only be made on receipt of a valid written customer request.</p>
						<p>Bookings may be postponed a maximum of two times within one year of the original booking date. Bookings may only be postponed by up to 6 months at a time.

Except as provided below for US, New Zealand and the UK, in all other cases where cancellations are made in writing 7 days or more before the arrival date listed on the booking confirmation form, or on written notification of a visa rejection and receipt of relevant supporting documentation, 100% of the tuition and accommodation fees will be refunded, but in all cases, the courier fee, accommodation placement fee (if utilized), enrollment fee (refundable in New Zealand) and any other service charges are non-refundable.

						<p>Courses 2 to 12 weeks&nbsp;
<br>
- Courses of 5 weeks or more but less than 3 months: Where a student withdraws within the first 5 days of the course for which attendance is required (i.e. Orientation), Kaplan may retain up to 25% of the full amount of any payments made by the student in respect of the course, and will refund the balance to the student.</p>

						<p>UK and Ireland: 'Distance Contract' means a distance contract or an off-premises contract as defined in the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (as amended from time to time). In the event of a Distance Contract, students for the UK or Ireland who are EU citizens shall have the right to cancel the legally binding contract formed in accordance with paragraph 1 of these terms and conditions if the student gives notice of cancellation to Kaplan within fourteen calendar day period beginning on the day on which the booking confirmation was issued by Kaplan. If a student exercises his or her right to cancel during this fourteen day period, he or she will receive a full refund of all amounts already paid by the student less any fees charged for services already performed by Kaplan. However, if the student has already commenced studying with Kaplan during the 14 day period, he or she must pay a reasonable charge calculated by Kaplan for the period of study undertaken. To exercise the right to cancel under the EU distance contract terms, the student must inform Kaplan at 2nd floor, Warwick Building, Kensington Village, Avonmore Road, London W14 8HQ, UK of the student's decision to cancel this agreement by a clear statement (e.g. by a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail). The student may use the model cancellation form found at www.kaplaninternational.com/terms, but it is not obligatory. The student can also electronically fill in and submit the model cancellation form or any other clear statement on the Kaplan website www.kaplaninternational.com. If the student uses this option, Kaplan will communicate to the student an acknowledgement of receipt of such a cancellation on a durable medium (e.g. by email) without delay.</p>
