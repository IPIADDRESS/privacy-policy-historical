						<p>Your privacy is very important to us and we are committed to protecting it. The Privacy Policy and User Agreement (the "Policy") explains what personal data we collect and how we use and disclose personal data collected from you. This Policy applies to the website for Kaplan, a division of Kaplan, Inc., at <a href="http://www.kaplaninternational.com">www.kaplaninternational.com</a> (the "Site") and any other information collected from you by Kaplan. The Policy does not govern the collection of information through any website other than through the Site; nor does this Policy govern the collection of information by any of our affiliated businesses or by third parties. By visiting or using the Kaplan website, you agree to follow its rules. By visiting the Site or submitting personal data to us, you accept the terms described in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Site and do not submit personal data to us.</p>
						<p><strong>Personal Data We Collect</strong>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>When you request information, enroll in our programs or contact us to become a partner, we collect personally identifying information such as your name, age, gender, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, educational and employment background and interests, and credit card information ("personal data"). If you are enrolling as a student, we may also&nbsp;collect other personal data, such as information regarding your health so that, if necessary, we can assess your application or make appropriate accommodation for you. In addition, if you send us an e-mail or communicate with us offline, we may collect the personal data that you voluntarily provide us at that time.</p>
						<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
						<p>We collect personal data in the manner described in this privacy policy. However, if you are a minor (under 18 years of age) and want to submit an application to study with us or subscribe to this website, register to play any games, sign up for latest offers or newsletters, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to apply and permission to provide personal information to us necessary to process your application. We will ask your parent or guardian to confirm you have permission to apply and we may ask you to provide an email address, residential address and telephone number for your parent or guardian. We may also carry out checks to verify that the contact details you have provided are for your parent or guardian.</p>
						<p><strong>Use of Personal Data</strong>
							<br>
We may use the personal data we collect from you in the following ways:</p>
						<ul>

							<li>Administrative Communications. We may use personal data to notify you about your enrollment or academic progress, other matters related to your use of our services, important information regarding the Site or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information may be important to your use of our services, you may not opt out of receiving such communications.</li>
							<li>Other Communications. We may use personal data to inform you of special offers and new or existing services that we believe may be of interest to you or to send surveys or questionnaires so that we can learn more about&nbsp;your needs and interests.

							<li>Purchases. When you enroll in our services, we may collect your credit card number or other payment account number (for example, your wireless account number), billing address and other information related to such purchase (collectively, "Payment Information") from you, and may use such Payment Information in order to fulfill your purchase.</li>
							<li>Promotions. We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, "Promotions"). We may ask you for certain personal data when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion, as they may contain additional information about Kaplan International English's use of personal data. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.</li>
							<li>Internal Business Purposes. We also may use personal data for our internal business purposes, such as to improve the Site, allow us to personalize the content that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences, and perform data analysis, audits and so forth.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Data</strong>
							<br>
We may disclose personal and other data we collect from you in the following ways:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Service Providers. We may hire other companies to perform services on our behalf including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of our Site and services, managing our database, contacting you, sending e-mail, and fulfilling your requests. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your personal data solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf. Kaplan is the data controller and will remain accountable for the personal information.</li>
							<li>Kaplan Affiliates. We also may share your data with other business divisions and subsidiaries of Kaplan, Inc. (our "Affiliated Businesses") that provide services we think might interest you.</li>
							<li>Business Transfers. Kaplan may in its sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your personal data to a third party in connection with a change in the corporate structure of Kaplan such as, but not limited to, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation, or transfer of substantial assets.</li>
							<li>Others. We may disclose personal information, as permitted or required by law, and to: (i) respond to inquiries or requests from governmental or public authorities; (ii) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Kaplan; (iii) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit damages that we may sustain; and (iv) enforce our agreements, including without limitation our enrollment terms and conditions.</li>
							<li>In some countries we work with representatives who may contact you directly and offer a personalised counselling service. These trusted partners may be supplied with or have access to your personal data for the sole purpose of providing services on our behalf.</li>
						</ul>

As we are an international business with employees, affiliates and service providers all over the world, please note that the personal data you provide to us may be transferred to and processed and stored in the United States or other countries, including without limitation your home country, the country in which you plan to matriculate or other countries where Kaplan, Inc. has offices.

Kaplan reserves the right to reject an applicant or terminate a student’s enrolment in the programme if the student’s continued participation represents a risk to their health and safety or to the health and safety of other students or staff, or if, notwithstanding reasonable accommodations, in the opinion of Kaplan, the student’s physical or mental condition makes the student unable or unlikely to successfully complete their programme. Refunds in such circumstances are at the discretion of Kaplan.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>USA: Some schools located on university campuses require students to provide a Health Declaration and Immunization form.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>7. Tuition fees:</strong> Tuition fees include lessons, orientation meeting, use of computer room and internet, placement and progress testing and a Kaplan certificate on completion of the course. Kaplan reserves the right to withhold the granting of a certificate attained by a student if tuition fees or any other fees remain outstanding, or other conditions are not met.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>8. Additional services:</strong> Any additional services (transfers, travel, laundry, telephone costs, excursions, medical costs, special diet, exam fees, change of accommodation and enrolment amendments) are not included in any fees unless specifically stated on a valid invoice.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>9. Twin accommodation:</strong> At Kaplan’s discretion, students may be required to book single room accommodation instead of twin room accommodation.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>10. Under 18 year olds:</strong> Kaplan delivers adult courses (except for programmes advertised as being fo young learners). Therefore, students aged 16 and 17 are advised that they will be attending classes with students aged 18 and over. Under 18 year olds may be required to pay a guardian fee, provide custodianship documents, live in Kaplan-approved accommodation, book Kaplan’s airport transfer service (these are compulsory in Australia and New Zealand) and purchase Kaplan medical insurance. All students under 18 must provide a signed Minor Authorisation form prior to arrival, and for Canada they must also provide a signed Health Declaration and excursion waiver form.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>UK/Ireland: The British and Irish governments require all students under 18 to submit a Waiver form and an Authorisation of Emergency Medical Treatment form which will be provided at the time of booking.&nbsp;</p>
						<h3><a id="s3" name="s3">Terms and Conditions</a></h3>
						<p><strong>1. Rules and regulations:</strong> Students’ arrangements with Kaplan are governed by the law of the country where the particular school attended is located.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>2. Arrivals and departures:</strong> All accommodation is booked from the Saturday or Sunday before the course start date until the Saturday morning after the course end date, unless otherwise advised. A partial week may be counted as 1 week’s accommodation. Students arriving between 22:30 – 6:00 may be asked to book alternative accommodation in a hotel on their first night due to late/early arrival at accommodation, or be charged an extra night accommodation.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>3. Late arrivals, vacations and absences:</strong> If you begin your enrolment late or are absent during your course, no refund will be made for the time missed. Periods of absence cannot be made up with a free extension of the course. Vacation dates are pre-built into the Academic Year and Academic Semester programmes and students cannot make changes to these dates. Breaks taken at other times will be marked as periods of absence. For other courses, granting of any Session Breaks after the course has started will be at the discretion of individual schools, according to visa regulations, and may incur a change fee or be marked as a period of absence.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>4. Meals and classes missed:</strong> No refunds or substitutions will be made for meals or classes missed due to exams, excursions, internships, first day orientation or other obligations that fall outside the normal schedule.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>5. Public holidays:</strong> Classes are normally not held and most school facilities are closed on public holidays. All published course start dates fall on a Monday. If the Monday is a public holiday, the start date will fall on a Tuesday. Compensation will not be made for classes not offered on public holidays.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>6. Campus facilities:</strong> Students attending a Kaplan school at a university or college campus location are advised that campus facilities may not be available during campus holidays. Further details are available from the Kaplan booking office.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>7. Change fees:</strong> A minimum of 4 weeks’ notice is required for any change. If you request a change of school location, course dates, accommodation or programme type after your course has started, you will be charged a change fee of GBP60, EUR85, USD100, CAD100, AUD75, NZD75 which is payable at the time the request is made. Kaplan is not obliged to fulfill any change request. Academic Year or Academic Semester students cannot transfer to a different Kaplan school during term time. If changing to a location where fees are lower, the difference in fees will not be refunded. If changing to a more expensive location or programme, the difference in fees will be charged. All changes are subject to Kaplan’s discretion and require approval of the Programme Director. You will not be charged a change fee if you extend your course, but late homestay extensions in Canada may require a re-placement fee of CAD100. It is the responsibility of the student to pay for any course or accommodation extensions. Any change of tuition resulting in a reduction in lessons will be treated as a termination of the existing booking and rebooking, and will thus be subject to the standard terms &amp; conditions governing terminations (see ‘Termination Policy’).&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>8. Duration of lessons:</strong> All English lessons are 45 minutes in duration unless otherwise stated. Courses run from Monday to Friday and lessons are scheduled in the morning or the afternoon. Kaplan cannot guarantee a specific timetable.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>9. Substitution policy:</strong> If, after the placement test taken on arrival at the school, a student is found to be at a level which is not appropriate for their booked course, the school reserves the right to place the student in an appropriate level class, which may have fewer lessons and a different curriculum. Students who do not have the ability to follow any course on offer may be required to terminate their studies with Kaplan. We also reserve the right to cancel courses at short notice due to insufficient demand.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>10. Programme changes:</strong> Kaplan has the right to change course dates, course curricula, tutors, locations and programmes at any time at its discretion. However, in cases where the course is rescheduled prior to the start of the first course and the new date is unacceptable to the student, all fees will be refunded.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>11. Prices:</strong> Kaplan has the right to change prices due to tax increases, governmental actions or other events beyond Kaplan’s control. Prices are valid for courses starting in 2014.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>12. Books and learning materials:</strong> All books and learning materials will be made available to students during their course. A book deposit (USD40) may be charged at the beginning of the course. This will be refunded at the end of the course, if the books are returned in good condition. Some specialised courses may require the purchase of books. In Canada, New Zealand and Australia a materials fee is charged to students to cover the cost of such items.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>13. Residential housing deposit:</strong> A refundable housing deposit of up to GBP250, EUR350, USD500, CAD600, NZD250-500 or AUD250 may be charged on arrival to students taking residential accommodation in the UK, Ireland, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The deposit is returned unless there is damage, loss or extra cleaning to be paid for on the student’s departure. In some cases the deposit may be non-refundable if the booking is cancelled.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>14. Expulsion/Suspension:</strong> Any student who commits a criminal offence, violates the student conduct code or school policy, has, in Kaplan’s opinion, a poor attendance record (whether or not such attendance is in breach of any visa attendance requirements), is absent for 14 consecutive days without notification (USA), or fails to pay an amount he or she is directly or indirectly liable to pay Kaplan in order to undertake the course, may be expelled or suspended. No refund will be given and the immigration authorities will be informed.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Student Code of Conduct: You agree to abide by the student conduct rules and other policies while attending Kaplan. As part of Kaplan’s commitment to our students’ success, we seek to provide an optimal learning environment and expect students to conduct themselves in a manner that is considerate of those around them. Inappropriate conduct includes but is not limited to: 1) disruptions to the learning environment (i.e. use of profanity, harassment, mobile phone use in classrooms, etc); (2) deliberate destruction, misuse, or theft of Kaplan property or the property of fellow classmates; (3) violence or threats of violence towards persons or property of students or Kaplan staff; (4) improper use of email or Internet access; and (5) failure to comply with local copyright or criminal laws forbidding the misappropriation, copying or alteration of copyright-protected materials.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>15. Liability:</strong> The liability of Kaplan, its group companies, their directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents and partners with respect to losses arising from negligence (except where such liability cannot be excluded as a matter of law), breach of contract or otherwise will be limited in all circumstances to the full amount paid to Kaplan or the relevant Kaplan group company by the relevant student for the particular programme. Such companies and persons will in no circumstances have any liability for indirect or consequential losses or damages.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>16. Force majeure:</strong> Kaplan will not be liable in cases where Kaplan is unable to fulfill any services to which they are contractually bound because of fire, natural disaster, act of government, failure of suppliers or subcontractors, labour disputes or other reasons which are beyond Kaplan’s control.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>17. Codes of practice:</strong> Kaplan has agreed to observe and be bound by the Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International Students published by the New Zealand Minister of Education and by the Australian National Code of Practice 2007 and the Educational Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (ESOS Act 2000). Information on these Codes is available on request from Kaplan or from <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz">www.minedu.govt.nz</a> and <a href="http://www.aei.gov.au">www.aei.gov.au</a>.</p>
						<p><strong>18. Photography, Filming and Sound Recording:</strong> Kaplan or its representatives may arrange to photograph or shoot video footage of students for promotional purposes, both printed and online. Any student who does not wish to participate should advise us at the time of booking and state at the time of the photographing or video shooting the wish not to participate. By accepting these terms and conditions, the student (and their parent/guardian if under 18) gives consent to the use of these photographs or video footage without further consent or notifications.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>19. Australia:</strong> Aspect Education Sydney Pty Ltd, WELS (Australia) Pty Ltd, Aspect ILA Perth Pty Ltd, Access Learning Institutes Pty Ltd and Kaplan International English Cairns Pty Ltd and Kaplan Business School Pty Ltd are trading as and referred to as Kaplan International Sydney City, Kaplan International Sydney Manly, Kaplan International Perth, Kaplan International Brisbane and Kaplan International Cairns, Kaplan International Melbourne and Kaplan International Adelaide. Agreement to the Kaplan Terms and Conditions does not remove the student’s right to take further action under Australia’s consumer protection laws, or their right to pursue other legal remedies under Australian law.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>20. Student Visa Australia/UK/USA/Canada/New Zealand:</strong> Student visa holders are required to provide Kaplan with a current residential address and telephone number at all times, maintain satisfactory academic progress and attend a minimum of 80% of their course (in Australia/Canada/USA/New Zealand; 85% in New York). In the UK if ten contact days are missed the student will be outside the terms of their visa and will be reported to the UK Border Agency. Students who fail to show up for their enrolment or with less than 80% attendance (in Australia/USA/Canada/New Zealand; 85% in New York) or who miss ten days (UK) will be reported to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) in Australia, The Border Agency in the UK, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the USA, Citizenship and Immicration Canada (CIC) in Canada, or to New Zealand Immigration Services. Information collected by Kaplan which personally identifies a student and information regarding a student’s course progress may be shared with the Australian State and Federal or British government, Department of Homeland Security, state and accrediting agencies (USA), designated authorities, the Tuition Protection Service (Australia), students’ parents, Kaplan staff and representatives. This information may include personal and contact details, course enrolment details and changes, and circumstances of any suspected breach by the student of any visa condition. Any school- aged dependents accompanying overseas students to Australia will be required to pay full fees if they are enrolled in either a government or non-government school.&nbsp;</p>
