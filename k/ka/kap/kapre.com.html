                    <h2>Website and Social Media Privacy Policy</h2><p><em>Last Revised:&nbsp; May 11, 2018</em></p><p>Welcome to the Website and Social Media Privacy Policy for the Brightwood Real Estate website (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site and not to other websites or services operated by Brightwood or its subsidiaries or affiliates.</p><p>Your privacy is very important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. We understand that you should be in control of your personal information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy explains the manner in which we collect personal information from you and the purpose of collecting the data. This Privacy Policy is designed to ensure that you are aware of how your personal information is being used and to provide you with choices about that use. We are required under data protection legislation to notify anyone who provides personal information to us, either directly or through a third party, of the information contained in this Privacy Policy. By visiting the Site or submitting your personal information, you accept the terms described in the Privacy Policy.</p><p><strong>Social Media Privacy</strong><br>Brightwood will not require you to:</p><ul><li>Disclose a username or password for accessing personal social media;</li><li>Access personal social media in the presence of Brightwood’s employees or representatives, or</li><li>Divulge any personal social media information.</li></ul><p><strong>Personal Information You Provide.&nbsp;</strong> We may collect and store personal information that can identify you, such as your name, postal address, email address (“Personal Information“), when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. We may collect and store any personal information you provide to us that may be contained in any video, comment or another submission you upload or post to the Site. Personal Information might also include title, telephone number; your likeness; and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). If sensitive information is collected, we will take appropriate efforts to comply with industry standards for the protection and proper disposal of all sensitive data, both online and offline. We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and date of birth, and other demographic information.</p><p>When you provide personal information to us, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.</p><p><strong>Personal Information From Other Sources.</strong> We may also periodically obtain personal information about you from other Brightwood businesses, business partners, contractors, and other third parties. Examples of information that we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information.</p><p><strong>Data Protection Principles.</strong> We will comply with data protection law, which says that the personal information we hold about you must be:</p><ul><li>Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way;</li><li>Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes;</li><li>Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes;</li><li>Accurate and kept up to data;</li><li>Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about; and</li><li>Kept securely.</li></ul><p><strong>Automated Information</strong></p><p><strong>Collection.</strong> We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your use of the Site.</p><p><strong>Information collected automatically.</strong> We automatically collect information from your browser when you interact with our Site. This information includes, but is not limited to, your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address.</p><p><strong>Cookies.</strong> When you visit our website, we use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site, to allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's password-protected features, and to collect information about your use of the Site. Cookies also benefit you by creating a more streamlined login process and keeping track of your language of choice between sessions, among other things. As we enable further customization of the site, cookies will help in assuring that the information provided to you will be relevant to your needs.<br>A cookie is a string of information that is sent by a website and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. Cookies are small files and won't pose any significant disk-space concerns. You can disable our cookies using the cookie-menu on your Web browser, but doing so may materially affect the functionality of this Site and the information you can access through it. To learn more about cookies and browser functionality, search for "cookies" in the help function of your browser.</p><p><strong>Other Technologies.</strong> Like many websites, we may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons, site tags, clear GIFs, and other similar technologies, to collect and maintain information about your web-surfing activity when you are visiting this Site, other Brightwood sites, as well as other non-Brightwood sites. We also may include web beacons or pixels tags in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image. Often a single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drive. Pixel tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.</p><p><strong>Do Not Track Practices.</strong> Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.&nbsp; Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.&nbsp; Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, Brightwood currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</p><p><strong>How We Use the Information We Collect.</strong> We will only use your personal information when the law allows.

Those policies will govern the use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p><p><strong>Security of Personal Information.</strong><br>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. Also, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, service providers, business partners, agents and other third parties who have a legitimate need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions or as otherwise agreed and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.<br><br>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.</p><p><strong>Storage and Retention of your Personal Information.</strong><br>We will only retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including to satisfy any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information. The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Please contact us using the contact details in this Privacy Policy if you would like more information.<br><br>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your information changes during your working relationship with us.<br><br>In some circumstances, we may anonymize your data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.</p><p><strong>Your Rights as a Data Subject.</strong><br>Under certain circumstances, by law, you have the right to:</p><ul><li>Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This request enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li><li>Request correction of the persona information that we hold about you. This request enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li><li>Request to be forgotten. This request enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li><li>Object to the processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li><li>Request the restriction of processing your personal information. This request enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example, if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li><li>Request the Data Portability of your personal information to another party.</li></ul><p>If you want to review, verify, correct or request removal of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal information or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact us using the contact details in this Privacy Policy.<br><br><strong>No fee usually required.</strong><br>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.<br><br><strong>What we may need from you.</strong><br>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.<br><br><strong>Your right to withdraw consent.</strong><br>In circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing, and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact us using the contact details in this Privacy Policy. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.<br><br><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy.</strong><br>We reserve the right to update the Privacy Policy at any time and will provide you with a new Privacy Policy when we make substantial updates.

In these circumstances, we will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is handled as described in this Privacy Policy. These steps will include appropriate contractual mechanisms. Please contact us using the contact details in this Privacy Policy if you would like more information.</p><p><strong>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information.</strong> We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and other Brightwood companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and websites of third parties.
