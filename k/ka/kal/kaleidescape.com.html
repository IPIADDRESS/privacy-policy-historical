		  <h1>Kaleidescape's Privacy Policy</h1>
		  <p>Kaleidescape, Inc. and its affiliates (hereafter referred to collectively as “Kaleidescape”) take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information that we collect and receive about you and your use of your Kaleidescape System (“System”), our Movie Guide Service, and our web site.</p>
		  <p>This Privacy Policy supplements and is incorporated into the Kaleidescape Service &amp; License Agreement. This Privacy Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you and Kaleidescape concerning the subject matter herein, and your acceptance of the Kaleidescape Service &amp; License Agreement will signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</p>
		  <p>To provide you with a better, more satisfying experience, Kaleidescape collects and uses certain types of information, as described below. Kaleidescape does not intend to disclose to any third party, except as provided below, any personal information, including what movies you – as an individual or household – have purchased, loaded into or viewed with your System.</p>
		  <h2>Types of Information Collected</h2>
		  <ul>
			  <li>Kaleidescape collects certain account information when you register, such as your name, contact and Kaleidescape System installation addresses, telephone number, and e-mail address. Kaleidescape collects additional account information from time to time, such as serial numbers of the components of your System and the software versions and options used by them.</li>
			  <li>Kaleidescape automatically collects and maintains a log of diagnostic information for every System for the purposes of quality control and technical troubleshooting. Diagnostic information includes a detailed record of the operating history of your System, such as every configuration change, DVD import, user inputs (including details about movies played), disk failure, user interface response time, and remaining available disk space. Diagnostic information also contains and is identified by the serial numbers of the components of your System and their IP addresses.</li>
			  <li> We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information from you when you visit our Web site. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors use and navigate our Web site on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each Web page, and the length of their visits.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h2>How We Use Information Collected</h2>
		  <p>We may use information in the following ways:</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to provide a service that you desire, to troubleshoot your System, or to send e-mails that you have requested.</li>
			  <li>To send you e-mail notifications about new or existing products and services, such as software upgrades.</li>
			  <li>To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services.</li>
			  <li>To provide third parties with aggregate information (that will not identify you or your household) about our user base and usage patterns, including movies played.</li>
			  <li>To allow us to personalize your experience using your System based on personal characteristics or preferences.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally-identifiable information outside of Kaleidescape.</p>
		  <p>We may disclose and use personally-identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce our Kaleidescape Service &amp; License Agreement (for example, when necessary to protect our or a third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights). We may also disclose personally-identifiable information when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.</p>
		  <p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products and services, processing registrations, and designing future products. We will only provide those companies with the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
		  <p>Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any country in which Kaleidescape or its subsidiaries or agents maintain a presence; you consent to any such transfer of your personal information outside of your country.</p>
		  <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>
		  <p>Kaleidescape is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, your personal information will be stored on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through encryption.</p>
		  <h2>Policy Modifications</h2>
		  <p> We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically.</p>
		  <h2>Technical Problems</h2>
		  <p>Even though Kaleidescape has taken steps to ensure that your personal information will not be collected, used or disclosed by Kaleidescape except as set forth by this Privacy Policy, technical mistakes are possible. If such a mistake takes place, we will take commercially-reasonable steps to correct it.</p>
		  <h2>Contact Kaleidescape</h2>
