      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Your privacy is greatly repected here. </p>
      <h4>Collection And Use of Information</h4>
      <p>I do not collect any personal information at all on this site. As with 
        all web sites, information about which pages you view is logged by my 
        server, and your <a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html">IP 
        address</a> is listed in the log. Other information commonly collected 
        in a Web server log includes your browser version, your computer's operating 
        system, and the date and time of your visit.</p>
      
  <p>When you perform a search on this site, the words you searched for are recorded 
    by Atomz, the company that provides the search service. Reports are available 
    to me that list which words were searched for, but I don't know who it was 
    that ran the search.</p>
      <h4>Cookies</h4>
      <p>This site does not use cookies at all.</p>
      <h4>Third Parties</h4>
      
  <p><a href="http://www.atomz.com/">Atomz</a> provides my search service. When 
    you view search results, those results appear to come from my site but are 
    hosted on their servers. Atomz is not bound by my privacy policy and may collect 
    and use information in ways other than specified in this privacy policy. I 
    would suggest that you read their privacy policy.</p>
