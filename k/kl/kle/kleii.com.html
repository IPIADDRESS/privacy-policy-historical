Users can access the Kleii service (the “Service”) through our website www.kleii.com, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “Device” is any computer used to access the Kleii Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Kleii Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information”.</p>

		<h4>Regarding Children</h4>
		<p></p><p>Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Kleii and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent’s permission before submitting information over the internet. By using Kleii, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have your parents’ permission to use Kleii.</p>

		<h4>Personal Information</h4>
		<p></p><p>In general, we collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through Kleii. We also collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on Kleii. For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, valid email address and password of your choice. When you personalize your profile and use the features of Kleii, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of Kleii, such as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information. We collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of Kleii, such as photos, comments, ratings and other information you choose to submit. We may also collect information about you and your friends, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. For instance, we may collect your user ID or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through Kleii in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and collections. When you order our products or services, you will need to submit your credit card or other payment information so that our service providers can process your payment for those products and services. When you sign up for, or win, any contests, sweepstakes, or other activities that we make available on Kleii, we will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include your contact information such as your address and phone number. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and all related information.

		<h4>Geo-Location Information</h4>
		<p></p><p>Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you download or use our mobile apps as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services. Some photos and videos you place in Kleii may contain recorded location information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. If you do not wish to share files embedded with your geo-location information with us, please do not upload them. If you don’t want to store location data in your photos or videos, please consult the documentation for your camera to turn off that feature. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location.</p>

		<h4>E-mail and E-mail Addresses</h4>
		<p></p><p>If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our “Feedback” form through Kleii, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide. We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through Kleii or the social network from which you have connected to Kleii (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content).

		<h4>Information Collected Via Technology</h4>
		<p></p><p>As you use Kleii, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on Kleii you clicked. This type of information is collected to make Kleii and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with Kleii to meet your special interests and needs.</p>
<p>An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access Kleii to assist with ad targeting.</p>
<p>“Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with Kleii. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. In order to use our services offered through Kleii, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of Kleii may not work properly, and you will not be able to receive our services.</p>

		<h4>Use and Disclosure of Information</h4>
		<p></p><p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not generally sell, trade, rent, or share the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.</p>
<p>In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us to provide you access to Kleii, to improve Kleii, to better tailor the features, performance, and support of Kleii and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us, our partners or our advertisers at your request. Additionally, we do share your content preferences and other information with the social network from which you have connected to Kleii, along with those companies and persons you have asked us to share your information with.</p>
<p>We may provide your Personal Information to third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of Kleii and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing customer service. We require our third-party service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our third-party partners, those with whom we have a co-branding or promotional relationship, or other third-parties about whom you are otherwise notified and do not request to opt out of such sharing. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of your personally identifiable information by such third-parties. We do not maintain responsibility for the manner in which third parties, including, without limitation, social networks, other partners and advertisers, use or further disclose Personal Information collected from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, after we have disclosed such information to those third parties. If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal Information collected about you in the manners identified in this Privacy Policy, you may not use Kleii.</p>
<p>Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control, we may in the future, and we may share some or all of your Personal Information with these companies, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.</p>

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer’s assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend our rights or property, you, or third parties.

You understand that when you use Kleii, certain information you post or provide through Kleii, such as your name, profile, comments, posts and ratings, may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions of Kleii, including without limitation, chatrooms, bulletin and message boards, along with other public forums.

		<h4>Your Stuff &amp; Your Privacy</h4>
		<p></p><p>By using our Services you provide us with information, files, and folders that you submit to Kleii (together, “your stuff”). You retain full ownership to your stuff. We don’t claim any ownership to any of it. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the limited rights that are needed to run the Services, as explained below.</p>
<p>We may need your permission to do things you ask us to do with your stuff, for example, hosting your files, or sharing them at your direction. This includes product features visible to you, for example, image thumbnails or document previews. It also includes design choices we make to technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe. You give us the permissions we need to do those things solely to provide the Services. This permission also extends to trusted third parties we work with to provide the Services, for example Amazon, which provides our storage space (again, only to provide the Services).</p>
<p>To be clear, aside from the rare exceptions we identify in our Privacy Policy, no matter how the Services change, we won’t share your content with others, including law enforcement, for any purpose unless you direct us to. How we collect and use your information generally is also explained in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your files and folders, and your communications with others while using the Services. For example, it’s your responsibility to ensure that you have the rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.</p>
<p>We may choose to review public content for compliance with our community guidelines, but you acknowledge that Kleii has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services.

We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request.

We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
