This Log Data is collected passively and may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the Site pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to provide you with the Services (for example, to provide push notifications on your mobile device) and pool it with other information to monitor the use of the Services, and for the technical administration of the Services. We do not associate your IP address with any other Personal Information to identify you personally, except in cases where we are asked to comply with a subpoena or other legal demand or where we suspect that there has been a violation of our policies, our Terms of Service and/or applicable law.</dd>

A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect Personal Information. Also, our cookies only collect information with respect to your visits to and actions on our Site. Klout may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Services and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our Services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and Services and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site.

In addition, Klout partners may access our application programming interfaces ("APIs") in order to determine your Klout Score by using information (such as Twitter handles) already in their possession.  They  may use this information to determine, for example, whether you qualify for certain benefits other than Perks.

You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to third parties like Klout.   When you add Social Media Service accounts to the Service or log into the Service using your Social Media Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable our Service to access that Social Media Service, but you will provide your login information, like your password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to Klout).  As part of such integration, the Social Media Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to such Social Media Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if and to the extent applicable, the policies of such Social Media Services.  However, please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Klout shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Media Services that may be enabled within the Service.</dd>
