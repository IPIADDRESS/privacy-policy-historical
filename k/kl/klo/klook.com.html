<li>11.1.4 All Klook Credits earned any time in the first calendar year will expire on the last day of the next calendar year. Therefore, if you are awarded a Klook Credit on 1 October 2017, that Klook Credit will expire and therefore be deducted from your account on 31 December 2018.

<ul>
<li>12.1 The Program <br>

<ul>
<li>12.1.1 On certain Klook Sites, Klook may offer members the chance to earn Klook Coupons, when they invite friends to become members of a Klook Site and those friends make a confirmed booking through an authorized Klook invitation channel (“Klook Authorized Channel”) (e.g. an invitation sent through Klook’s website, Facebook or another social media channel as supported by Klook). </li></ul></li>
<li>12.2 Terms <br>

<ul>
<li>12.2.1 You may only earn Klook Coupons via Klook’s authorized member invite mechanisms. Referrals outside of Klook Authorized Channel will not result in any Klook Coupons. You understand that Klook Coupons are not transferable, may not be auctioned, bartered or sold, and may not be pooled with other members. </li>
<li>12.2.2 You will only receive Klook Coupons for the first confirmed booking made by a friend who makes his or her first booking on the Klook Sites and subsequently completes his or her first booking as a result of an invite from you via a Klook Authorized Channel. If your friend does not follow the directions in the invite email or other valid invite mechanism to accept the invitation, you may not receive Klook Coupons, and Klook will have no liability to you for your friend’s failure to follow directions. </li>
<li>12.2.3 You agree that having multiple Klook Accounts is a violation of this Terms of Use and that sending invites to alternate email addresses or accounts or otherwise attempting to circumvent the Klook Referral Program system may, without limiting any of Klook’s other rights or remedies, result in forfeiture of your membership and all Klook Coupons in your Klook Account. </li>

<p>We’ll refund <strong>double the difference</strong>…if you find a cheaper price!</p>
<p>We know that one of the most important things for travelers is getting a fair price and not feeling ripped off. That’s why we constantly monitor our pricing to ensure that you get the best price available online and at your destination. We also make it a point to display honest pricing on all our deals, including all extra charges and taxes so you'll never have to worry about additional costs.</p>
<p>We’re so confident about our pricing that if you find a better price, we’ll refund DOUBLE the difference! </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>So, if you: 

</strong><ul><strong>
<li>• Find a lower price (in the same currency) for the same tour or activity and notify us  within 48 hours of booking, or</li>
</strong><li><strong>• Arrive at your destination and find your booked tour or activity offered for a lower price</strong></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>you can send us the details and we'll refund double the difference in the form of Klook Credits OR we’ll refund the full price difference to your card.</p>
<p>Yup, you read us right!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>How to request a refund?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's simple and easy: obtain proof of the lower rate (receipt, price list, flyer, website, screenshot etc.), and email us at support@klook.com with your name and booking number. We’ll add double the difference value to your account as Klook Credits, or refund the full price difference direct to your card.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong></p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>• Products must be sold by official channels and registered travel agencies.</li>
<li>• This guarantee does not include any city or airport transfers.</li>
<li>• This guarantee does not include multi-day tours.</li>

<li>• Klook reserves the right to verify details of the lower price where possible, all refund decisions will be made at the sole discretion of Klook.</li>
<li>• Refunds of the price difference will be transacted to the credit card used in the original booking.</li>
<li>• If you used Klook credits or a promo code when making your booking, you will receive a refund of twice the difference from the original Klook price, not the discounted price </li></ul></li></ul></li>
