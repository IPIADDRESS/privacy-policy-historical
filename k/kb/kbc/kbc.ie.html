<h5>Internet Fraud</h5>
<p>A number of banking organisations and their customers have from time to time been the target of hoax e-mails that are aimed at gathering Internet/account details of the customers. Some of these hoax e-mails have encouraged or facilitated contact with hoax websites that purport to be (but are not) the website of the relevant banking organisation. To date the occurrence of such online fraud has not been extensive. However, we would always advise you to be cautious as regards disclosing your personal details. In particular, you should note that we will only ever request your personal details if: (i) you are seeking to initiate e-mail contact with us via this Website; or (ii) you initiate a request for a particular service via this Website and we require certain of your personal details to provide you with the requested service.</p>
<h5>Hyperlinks</h5>
<p>Some of the pages on this Website contain hypertext links to websites not maintained by KBCI. You are reminded that different terms and conditions of use will apply to you as a user of such websites. In addition such websites may not attain the same privacy standards that KBCI maintains.</p>
<h5>Data Protection Policy</h5>
<p>In addition to this Privacy Statement, you may wish to read our Data Protection Policy which is also available on our website at www.kbc.ie.</p>
<h5>Changes to the Privacy Statement</h5>
<p>Any changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted on this website so you are always aware of what information KBCI collect through this website, how KBCI use it, and under what circumstances, if any, KBCI disclose it. If at any time KBCI decide to use Personal Data in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Statement, or otherwise disclosed to you at the time it was collected, KBCI will notify you by email or post, at our option, and you will have a choice as to whether or not KBCI use your information in the new manner.</p>
