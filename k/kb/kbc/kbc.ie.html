<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>KBC Bank Ireland Plc</strong></p>
<strong> </strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Website Privacy Statement</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of KBC Bank Ireland plc (including our subsidiaries) (collectively and individually “KBCI”) to comply with the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to outline how KBCI deal with any personal data you provide to us while visiting our website.</p>
<p>By visiting this website, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Statement.  KBCI shall have no liability to you for any claims, losses or damages arising out of or in connection with the use, disclosure or other processing of your personal data in accordance with the Privacy Statement and your consents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of information collected</strong></p>
<p>We retain two types of information from visitors to our website:</p>
<p>1. “Personal Data”: This is data that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you and may include your name, postal address, email address, telephone number and birth date.  The information you provide will be used for the purposes for which it was intended/submitted and as set out in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>2. “Non-Personal Data”: Like most websites, KBCI gather statistical and other analytical information collected on an aggregate basis of all visitors to our website. This Non-Personal Data comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information regarding browser types and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our website. KBCI collects this information to help us monitor traffic on the website and manage the website’s performance, efficiency and capacity etc. This information also helps KBCI understand what parts of the website are effective/well used and what parts are not being fully utilised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>This website uses “cookie” technology.  KBCI will also use cookies to facilitate your use of the KBC Online Banking Service, where KBCI has agreed to give you access to that service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are Cookies?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of information, stored in simple text files, placed on your computer by a website. Cookies can be read by the website on your subsequent visits so that you can access information in a faster and more efficient way. The information stored in a cookie may relate to your browsing habits on the web page, or a unique identification number so that the website can "remember" you on your return visit. Generally speaking, cookies do not contain personal information from which you can be identified, unless you have separately furnished such information to the website.</p>
<p>You can at any time set your browser to reject cookies.  However if you reject our session cookies, this may affect your ability to use the KBCI Online Banking service and / or our website.</p>
<p>For more information on how to manage cookies, including how to opt-out of performance cookies please visit: www.aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>KBCI uses two different types of cookies: “session” cookies and “performance” cookies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Session Cookies</strong></p>
<p>“Session” cookies help users to navigate through our website.  They are deleted once your leave our website.  Session cookies do not contain anything other than a session identification number which allows the webserver to “remember” where you are on the website.  Session cookies are especially important for using KBC Online Banking. Some examples of these cookies include:</p>
<p>•	Identifying you as being signed in to KBC Online Banking and keeping you logged in throughout your visit.</p>
<p>•	Remembering the content of forms which you may have completed on our website (www.kbc.ie)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Performance Cookies</strong></p>
<p>“Performance” cookies are used by KBCI to provide statistics and reports on the usage of our website (details in relation to which pages on our website users visited, how they got there etc).  Some of these cookies are saved to your computer so that we know when you revisit our website. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and used anonymously. We use these cookies to understand what content is popular which helps us to improve our website.  An example of a performance cookie is Google Urchin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Telephone calls</strong></p>
<p>Please note that any telephone calls to KBCI may be recorded for customer service and to verify the content of any conversation, including customer instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Purposes for which we hold your Information</strong></p>
<p>(i) Use of Non-Personal Data</p>
<p>KBCI use the Non-Personal Data gathered from visitors to our website in an aggregate form to understand the demographics of the users of our website and to help us better design and organise our website.  The tool used for this analysis is Google Urchin.</p>
<p>KBCI uses Google Urchin to assist it in gathering and analysing Non-Personal Data for the reasons described above.  While Google Urchin will collect your IP address as part of this analysis, your IP address will not be available to or used by KBCI for any purposes.  No other form of Personal Data is gathered by these Google Urchin services.</p>
<p>(ii) Web Browsing</p>
<p>Except as explained above in relation to Google Urchin and your IP address, by simply visiting our website you do not disclose, nor does KBCI collect personal data on you.  All that KBCI may know about your visit may be limited to technical data.  By visiting our website KBCI may collect information regarding your visit such as</p>
<p>1.	The top level domain name from which you access the internet (for example .ie, .com, .org, .net)</p>
<p>2.	The previous website address, search engine or advertising link from which you reached us (if relevant)</p>
<p>3.	The type of web-browser you used</p>
<p>4.	Web traffic data, including which pages you visited.</p>
<p>This data shall be used for administrative and statistical purposes and may be shared with our internet service provider. KBCI will use this information to help us to improve our website.</p>
<p>(iv) Personal Data</p>
<p>KBCI will process any Personal Data you provide to us through the website for the following purposes:</p>
<p>(a) to provide you with information about the services of KBCI in respect of which you have enquired;</p>
<p>(b) to enable you to access your accounts online where KBCI has agreed to give you access to the KBC Online Banking Service;</p>
<p>(c) to contact you if required in connection with your account or enquiry or to respond to any communications you might send to us;</p>
<p>(d) to help us improve our services and systems; and</p>
<p>(e) as otherwise notified to you at the time you provide the information to us.</p>
<p>KBCI do not currently conclude agreements with customers solely on the basis of online applications on the website for loans, mortgages or other financial services.  Any applications submitted online or by email will be subject to the same terms and conditions as those completed by hand in paper form including additional terms and conditions relating to credit checking, money laundering and regulatory notices. If any online application forms are included in the website, you will be notified of any additional specific data protection provisions at the time you complete the relevant application form.  Prior to providing any information to KBCI through this website which relates to other individuals, you agree to inform those individuals of, and obtain their consent to, the disclosure to and use by the KBC Group of their information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement and for any additional purposes notified to you.</p>
<p>Please note that by using this website, you are giving us your consent, to the extent required, to process your personal data as outlined in this Privacy Statement.  Your consent and our rights to process your personal data extend to any successor or assignee of KBCI and/or any of its businesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>KBCI may provide Non-Personal Data to third parties, where such information is combined with similar information of other users of KBCI’s website. For example, KBCI may inform third parties regarding the number of unique visitors to KBCI’s website, the demographic breakdown of our community users of our website, or the activities that visitors to our website engage in while on our website. The third parties to whom KBCI may provide this information may include our website design, development, support and hosting contractors.</p>
<p>Each of the KBCI companies may share your Personal Data with the other KBCI companies and with KBC Bank NV and its subsidiaries (together the “KBC Group”) for management and reporting purposes, as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, or as disclosed to you at the time the information is collected. KBCI will not disclose your Personal Data to third parties outside of the KBC Group (which for these purposes shall include its agents and third party services providers) unless you have consented to this disclosure or unless the disclosure is required in order to process an application or other communication from you or to perform the services you have applied for or to efficiently manage your account. KBCI will however disclose your Personal Data if KBCI believe in good faith that KBCI or KBC Group are required to disclose it in order to comply with any applicable law, a summons, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process, including protecting and defending KBCI’s or the KBC Group’s rights and property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sale of Business</strong></p>
<p>KBCI reserve the right to transfer information (including your Personal Data) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of KBCI or any of its subsidiaries provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of the Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while KBCI will take all reasonable steps to protect your Personal Data, the nature of the Internet is such that KBCI cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us via the Internet.

<p><strong>Internet Fraud</strong></p>
<p>Banking organisations and their customers may from time to time be the target of hoax e-mails that are aimed at gathering Internet/account details of the customers.

We would always advise you to be cautious as regards disclosing your personal details. In particular, you should note that we will only ever request your personal details if: (i) you are seeking to initiate e-mail contact with us via this Website; or (ii) you initiate a request for a particular service via this Website and we require certain of your personal details to provide you with the requested service.</p>
