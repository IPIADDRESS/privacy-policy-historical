<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>
    KBCafe.com, Resumebay.net and Talk-sports.net, here-in referred to as
    simply KBCafe, are committed to protecting your online 
privacy while providing you with the most useful and enjoyable Web experience 
possible. While you can use many features of KBCafe anonymously, you 
are required to provide personal information to gain access to some of our 
premium content and services.</p>
<h2>How we collect and use personal information</h2>
<p>
    We occasionally will send e-mail to notify you about important changes to the 
site, new services, and special offers from us. In addition to receiving 
e-mail announcements, you can also sign up for e-mail services.</p>
<p>If you enter a contest or respond to a promotion, we may ask 
for your postal address so we can notify contest winners and deliver promotional 
goodies. We occasionally may also send you 
postal mail to notify you about important changes to the site, new services, and 
special offers from us and select KBCafe partners. </p>
<h2>How we protect your personal information</h2>
<p>In addition to using the most secure technology available, we 
work tirelessly to make sure that we use any information you provide us only in 
ways you have approved. </p>
<h2>How we use "cookies"</h2>
<p>As you probably know, "cookies" are small pieces of 
information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you 
visit them. Like many other Web sites, KBCafe uses cookies to 
identify members so they donâ€™t have to enter information
    upon each 
visit. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify 
security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. 
Even if you do not use cookies, you can still access all of the features on our 
site by logging in manually with each visit.</p>
<h2>What we provide to third parties</h2>
<p>While KBCafe does not provide any third-party 
access to your personal information except to facilitate your own attempts to 
register with our partners or receive offers from select partners as mentioned 
elsewhere in this policy, we may provide third parties with aggregate statistics 
about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information. This data 
reflects site usage patterns gathered during millions of customer visits to our 
Web site each month, but it does not contain behavioral or identifying 
information about any individual member unless that member has given us 
permission to share that information.</p>
<p>
    KBCafe uses a third-party advertising company to 
serve ads when you visit our sites. This company may use information (not 
including your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your 
visits to our and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods 
and services of interest to you. In addition, we share Web site usage 
information about visitors to our site with this company for the purpose of 
managing and targeting advertisements on our sites. </p>
<h2>Obtaining your consent</h2>
<p>By using our Web site, you give KBCafe permission to collect information about the pages served to 
you as an anonymous user for the purpose of calculating aggregate site 
statistics. If you register at KBCafe, you authorize KBCafe
to use information you provide to personalize the information we deliver 
to you and to use your demographic information when calculating aggregate 
customer data. As a registered user, you
    give KBCafe and our 
agents permission to send you e-mails related to the subscription e-mail 
services to which you subscribe and the Free Product Info topics you select.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of 18, you must not provide your 
name, e-mail address, or any other identifying information without the consent 
of your parent or guardian, or as otherwise provided for by applicable law.</p>
<p>Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page 
so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and 
under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
<h2>Tell us what you think</h2>
<p>
    KBCafe welcomes your questions and comments 
about our privacy policy. Please send e-mail to feedback@kbcafe.com.</p>
