<center><b>PRIVACY STATEMENT</b></center><br><br>
This Privacy Statement operates in conjunction with and constitutes a part of Four Points’ <a href="/Protected/4Points/legal/FPMG_TOU.html">Terms of Use Agreement</a> (the “Agreement”) and informs you of Four Points’ practices with respect to the online collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from this Four Points Website. Personal information is information that allows us to contact you (such as email address, home address, or telephone number) or other information that, when linked to your name or contact information, allows us to personalize your visit to our site by providing you with information that suits your interests. <br><br>
Four Points is the owner of this website and retains all ownership rights to the information collected at this site. Four Points reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Statement. Any changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted here, and we encourage you to check back from time to time. <br><br>
<b>THIS POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO THE PRACTICES OF COMPANIES THAT FOUR POINTS DOES NOT OWN OR CONTROL, OR TO PEOPLE THAT FOUR POINTS DOES NOT EMPLOY OR MANAGE.</b><br><br>
<b>Personalization</b><br><br>
Although you may use many features of this site without completing a registration or sign-up form, visitors who do register and/or sign up for special services may have access to additional features of the site and are more likely to receive information suited to their interests. For example, a registered user is eligible for additional services provided by this website, such as personalized content. Our registration and special services sign-up forms may ask you for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic information (like zip code or age). You must provide the information in order to receive the benefits of registration or of the special service. <br><br>
We may use the contact information you give us to better tailor your website experience to your interests, and to send you information about Four Points and its services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our partners. We use other information that you provide to us to show you content in which you may be interested and to display the content according to your preferences. We will also share this information within the Four Points family and with our affiliates and business partners in order to enhance your experience on this and other Four Points Websites. <br><br> 
In addition, we may share this information with advertisers or other third parties that are not part of the Four Points family. <br><br> 
<b>Online Surveys/Contests</b><br>
From time to time, we may conduct online surveys and contests. These ask you for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic information (like zip code or age). We may use this contact information from our surveys and contests to provide you with information about our company and promotional material on behalf of some of our partners, and to contact you. <br><br>
<b>Supplemental Information </b><br>
To enhance Four Points’ ability to tailor this site to your preferences, we may combine information that you provide us on registration and other online sign-up forms with other information about you that we may obtain. <br><br> 
<b>Shopping/Commercial Services</b><br>
This Four Points site may offer shopping services, which may be offered by us or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our site offers shopping or other commercial services, you will use a customer order form to request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to give us contact information (like name or email address), financial information (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like zip code or age). <br><br>

We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products and services. By giving our site your credit card and related personal information, you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order. <br><br>

We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders. We may also use contact data to get in touch with you.  We will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval. <br><br>

<b>Public Forums</b><br>
This site may make available chat rooms, blogs, forums, message boards, and news groups. Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in any chat room, blog, forum, message board, or news group. <br><br> 
<b>Information Sharing With Third Parties</b><br>
From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by Four Points to provide additional features at this site. These special relationships may include “powered by” partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “co-branded pages”). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity. You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our third party partner, whose privacy practices we do not control. You should check our partner’s website for information regarding its privacy policies, as its policies, not ours, will govern the information that it receives from you. <br><br>

Also, the nature of some features of our site may require that we share personal information about you with other persons or other companies. For example, this may occur at a feature that enables you, via our site, to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of Four Points. By responding to those features of the site, whether by email or direct entry of information on the Four Points Website, you are consenting to our transfer of that information to such persons or entities, whose privacy policy or practices will apply to the information it receives. <br><br>
<b>IP Address and Log Files</b><br>
We may use your IP address to administer the Four Points Website, to help diagnose problems with our server, to analyze trends, to track users’ webpage movements, to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. <br><br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
This Four Points site may use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the site. Cookies reside on your computer and help the Four Points Website as well as other websites operated by third parties, including our vendors and advertisers, to recognize your computer’s browser as a previous visitor. This information allows us to customize delivery of information. For example, our site may use cookies to save and remember registration information or preferences that you may have set while browsing the site, to keep track of your shopping cart, to ensure you don’t see the same ad content repeatedly, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We use cookies only to gather information as indicated in this policy; however, the use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by our vendors, advertisers, and affiliates, is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.  For additional information about ad network providers, visit http://www.networkadvertising.org.  Disabling cookies may result in receiving less than the full benefit from the use of this Four Points Website. <br><br>
