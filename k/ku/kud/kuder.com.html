<h3><a name="Limitations" class="scroll_fix" id="Limitations"></a>Limitations on Data Collection</h3>

<p>In furtherance of Kuder's effort to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and to insure the security of data collected from children under the age of 13, Kuder only collects data from such children pursuant to the Parental Permission and a specific agreement between the child's school and Kuder that Kuder is to act as an agent of the child’s school or educational institution. Kuder specifically contracts with such institutions for services which allow the school to input individual information for each child onto the web site. It is important that Kuder and the schools comport to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and obtain parental permission, if required under the Act, before completing the child's registration with the web site, or before allowing a child to complete registration. If Kuder receives a direct request from a child under 13 to access the system, and Kuder has not received written consent from a parent or guardian, Kuder will utilize the information solely for a one-time response to the child.</p>

<h3><a name="Changes" class="scroll_fix" id="Changes"></a>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you or the school authorizing the data collection by way of an e-mail. You or the school will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. Otherwise, we will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which we collected the information from you.</p>

<p>If at any time Kuder makes changes to this Privacy Policy, we will inform parents of those children who have input data onto the web site and who, at the time of the policy change, are under the age of 13, of the policy change and how any policy change will affect the collection utilization and dissemination of any information. If, at this or any other time, the parent wishes to change or remove any information from Kuder's database related to data collected from children under the age of 13, they may utilize the Changing Personal Information or Opt In/Opt Out provisions outlined below, or contact the Kuder web site administrator at <a href="mailto:support@kuder.com">support@kuder.com</a>, by written communication to Webmaster, Kuder, 302 Visions Parkway, Adel, Iowa, 50003, or directly by telephone at (800) 314-8972.</p>
