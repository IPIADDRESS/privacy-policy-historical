			<p align="justify">This website complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.  Accordingly, <b>CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE MAY NOT ACCESS THIS WEBSITE WITHOUT PARENT, TEACHER OR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR PERMISSION.</b>  Access to the data collection aspects of this website is made only through a student's school.  Such schools obtain access only through an agreement executed by both NCASI and the particular school.  Accordingly, each school is specifically responsible for monitoring student usage of this website.  By utilizing the data collection aspects of this website, you acknowledge that your school is acting in the place of the students' parents in granting NCASI specific authorization to collect such information, upon the terms and conditions stated herein.  In offering services to your school, NCASI collects the following information from students:</p>
			<p align="justify">Name, address, school, age, gender, ethnicity, date of birth, email addresses, career assessment data.</p>
			<p align="justify"><u>Privacy and Security.</u></p>
			<p align="justify">NCASI HAS TAKEN SEVERAL STEPS TO INSURE THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF ALL INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THIS WEBSITE.  NCASI ONLY COLLECTS INFORMATION FROM INDIVIDUALS OVER THE AGE OF 12, OR FROM INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF 13 IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS ACCESSING THE WEBSITE UNDER THE DIRECTION AND CONSENT OF A PARENT, TEACHER OR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR.  NCASI COLLECTS AND PROCESSES THE INFORMATION TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO THE PARTICULAR SCHOOLS CONTRACTING FOR ITS COLLECTION. NCASI MAY ALSO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES PROVIDING CAREER PLACEMENT SERVICES. THE COLLECTED INFORMATION RELATES TO STUDENTS' CAREER PREFERENCES AND INTERESTS.  THIS INFORMATION IS COLLECTED DIRECTLY FROM THE CHILD, PARENT, TEACHER OR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR.  NCASI ALSO UTILIZES COOKIES TO ASSIST CHILDREN, PARENTS, TEACHERS AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IN ACCESSING AND UTILIZING THE SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THIS WEBSITE.  NCASI WILL NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION RELATING TO ANY CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 13 TO ANY PARTY OTHER THAN AUTHORIZED EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.  ADDITIONALY, NCASI WILL NOT SELL THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTY MARKETERS OR DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION PUBLICLY.  ALL OF THE THIRD PARTY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO WHICH INFORMATION IS DISCLOSED HAVE AGREED TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THE INFORMATION.  IF YOU ARE THE PARENT OF A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 13 WHO HAS PROVIDED INFORMATION THROUGH THIS WEBSITE AND WOULD LIKE TO PREVENT THE INFORMATION FROM BEING TRANSMITTED TO AUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS FOR CAREER AND EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE CONTACT THE NCASI WEBMASTER AT THE ADDRESS LISTED BELOW UNDER CHANGING PERSONAL INFORMATION, OR DIRECTLY AT NCASI@NCASI.COM.  NCASI HAS TAKEN GREAT STRIDES TO COLLECT ONLY THAT INFORMATION NECESSARY TO FURTHER THE CHILDRENS' CAREER DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES LISTED ABOVE.  IF AT ANY TIME THIS WEBSITE BEGINS TO COLLECT ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OTHER THAN CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND CHILD IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, NCASI WILL NOTIFY THE SCHOOLS AND OBTAIN A NEW CONSENT FROM THE SCHOOL TO COLLECT SUCH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13.</p>
			<p align="justify"><u>Advertising</u></p>
			<p align="justify">While NCASI does not presently utilize third party advertising companies on its website, NCASI may provide such advertising in the future.  Except as provided for above however, NCASI will not provide any individual identifiable information to such third party advertisers relating to children under the age of 13.  Any such information relating to such children will only be provided in the aggregate, without names, addresses, or other contact information, like telephone numbers or e-mail addresses.</p>
			<p align="center"><a name="information"></a><b>INFORMATION</b></p>
			<p align="justify">NCASI is the sole owner of the information collected on this website. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We collect information from our users at several different points on our website. NCASI will never distribute any personally identifiable information, concerning any minor, regardless of the source from which it was obtained. NCASI does not collect information from any children under the age of 13 without identifiable parent, guardian, teacher or school administrator consent.</p>
			<p align="justify">Remember, however, the very best protection involves counseling your children regarding providing information online, and supervising their online activities. If you have any questions regarding any aspect of our Privacy Policy or would like to remove any information collected directly from a child under thirteen years of age, please email us at <a href="mailto:ncasi@ncasi.com">ncasi@ncasi.com</a>

NCASI specifically contracts with such institutions for services which allow them to input individual information for each child onto the website.  It is important that schools obtain parental permission before inputting a child's information onto the website, or before allowing a child to input the information themselves.  At no time will NCASI knowingly collect online contact information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent, or the consent of a representative from an authorized educational institution.  If NCASI receives a direct request from a child under 13, and the child is not affiliated with an authorized educational institution, without parental or authorized educational institution consent, NCASI will utilize the information solely for a one-time response to the child.</p>
