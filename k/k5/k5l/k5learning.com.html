<p>The student's area of our website (the pages your child uses after logging in) contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>no advertising or commercial messages</li>
<li>no external links</li>
<li>no “chat”, message board or similar features</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly disagree with the amount of advertising targeted at young children, and we will <strong>never</strong> target your children with any sort of commercial messages.</p>
<p>We do not collect children's e-mail addresses or other contact information and we will never contact your child in any way.</p>
<h4>Children's Privacy Guidelines</h4>
<ul>
<li>We do not collect any information directly from students other than the performance data they generate as they complete our lessons. </li>
<li>We do not give the ability for students to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information. </li>
<li>We do not distribute to third parties any student's personally identifiable information without prior parental consent. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Performance Data</h4>
<p>As your child completes lessons, we do record certain data (“Performance Data”) related to their interactions with the program (e.g. the score on a quiz). We will use Performance Data to measure your child’s performance and to adapt the lessons to his or her learning needs and provide you with progress reports about your child’s performance. In addition, we may aggregate your child’s Performance Data with the Performance Data of other children using our website for marketing and other business related purposes. Aggregate information will be anonymous and will not identify your child.</p>
<h2 class="blue-subtitle">Education Partners</h2>
<p>Certain of our lessons are licensed from third party education companies ( our “Education Partners”). Certain web pages delivered to the student when doing his lessons will be delivered from the servers of our Education Partners and certain links your child will use to initiate lessons will link to these servers. These web pages are customized for K5 and are considered to be part of our website for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Certain parts of your child’s Performance Data will be retained on the servers of our Education Partners. We do not share your or your child’s personal information with our Education Partners in any way that would allow them to personally identify you or your child or who the Performance Data belongs to. The policies and procedures of our Education Partners fully conforms with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2><span class="blue-subtitle">Parent’s Personal Information Collection &amp; Use</span></h2>

<p>We may use the information we collect from you in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>for our own internal record keeping;</li>
<li>to communicate with you, including by email, for various reasons including your student’s use and progress on K5, the status of your account or for other purposes related to the administration of your account on K5;</li>
<li>to respond to your customer service requests;</li>
<li>to process your transactions;</li>
<li>to administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature</li>
<li>to send periodic emails regarding the status of or changes to&nbsp; our services or site features;</li>
<li>to send marketing, marketing research or promotional materials or newsletters by email, including&nbsp; advertorial emails from carefully selected third parties, which you may unsubscribe from if you wish</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information except as described herein unless we have your permission or are required by law.</p>
<p>If another entity acquires our company or business, the personally identifiable information and non-personal information we have about you will and any students you have registered will be transferred to this acquiring entity.</p>
<h2><span class="blue-subtitle">Contests and Promotions:</span></h2>
<p>We may offer&nbsp; contests and other promotions that may require registration. By entering any contest or promotion, personally identifiable information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such, contest or promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment and as otherwise required by law or permitted by the promotion’s rules.</p>
<h2 class="blue-subtitle">Advertising</h2>
<p>Ads appearing on our site may be delivered to you by third party advertisers or advertising networks such as Google Adsense. Such parties may set cookies; these cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement in order to compile non-personal identification information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<h2 class="blue-subtitle">Use of Contractors</h2>
<p>We may retain the service of outside contractors to perform services on our behalf (for example, software programming, technical support or email list management). At times, we may disclose relevant personally identifiable information about you to our contractors so they may provide these specific services for us. We require our contractors to keep this information confidential and to only use the information on our behalf.</p>
<h2 class="blue-subtitle">Disclosures Required by Law</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe in good faith that an applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of another user.</p>
<h4>External Links</h4>
<p>The public areas of our web site contain  various educational, marketing and other materials including third party  advertisements. These pages are not intended for use by children who  have logged onto the site using the student log-in, and may contain  links to web sites not maintained by K5. The privacy and data collection  practices on any linked web sites are entirely separate from K5 and are  not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
