                    <p>
                        Below is a privacy statement that applies to Kmart.</p>
                    <h4>
                        You know us - you can trust us</h4>
                    <p>
                        At Kmart, we understand and share our customers' and employees concerns about how
                        personal information is collected, used and shared. We want to assure you that we
                        will always handle personal information securely and carefully. We are committed
                        to safeguarding your information; this means that, among other things, we will comply
                        with all applicable Australian privacy laws and ensure our staff are aware of their
                        obligations.</p>
                    <h4>
                        Why we collect information</h4>
                    <p>
                        We may collect information to deliver products or services to complete other transactions
                        and better understand our customers requirements and preferences. This information
                        enables us to personalise and improve our service and in particular to provide offers
                        that are of greater interest or benefit.</p>
                    <h4>
                        How we collect this information</h4>
                    <p>
                        When a customer places an order and/or register their details with us, we store
                        that information for future reference. This saves time when customers shop with
                        us again, as we do not have to re-enter customer details. Sometimes we may add customers
                        personal information with information from external sources. This is mainly done
                        to verify the accuracy of the information we have and, again, to personalise and
                        improve our service.</p>
                    <h4>
                        What we collect</h4>
                    <p>
                        The personal information we collect is in most cases supplied when customers register
                        details, place an order or provide feedback to us. Generally, the information we
                        collect includes customer name, address, delivery address, phone number and e-mail
                        address. We will sometimes obtain other details, such as age.</p>
                    <h4>
                        Who we may share your information with</h4>
                    <p>
                        We will often need to pass personal details such as name and address to companies
                        who perform parts of our service delivery. This includes organisations such as major
                        delivery companies, out-sourced call centres, mail houses and third party fulfilment
                        contractors. In special circumstances, for example if we sell our business or a
                        substantial part of our business, your information may be transferred as part of
                        that sale. We will not use customer/employee information for purposes unrelated
                        to the services we provide, unless we first obtain your consent. From time to time,
                        we may provide aggregated and "de-identified" information to other business partners
                        for various purposes. If you would like to access your personal information, please
                        e-mail your request to Customer Satisfaction Compliance Manager or contact our customer
                        service department on <a href="mailto:customer.satisfaction@kmart.com.au">customer.satisfaction@kmart.com.au</a>.</p>
                    <h4>
                        Security</h4>
                    <p>
                        We will take all reasonable steps to store your personal information securely. Only
                        specific employees in our customer service, marketing, human resources, store systems
                        and IT areas have access to our customers' and employee personal information, and
                        only under strict controls and procedures.</p>
                    <h4>
                        Other Sites</h4>
                    <p>
                        Kmart is not responsible for the privacy practices of sites that are linked to this
                        site via hyperlinks, banner advertising or otherwise. Please take care at all times
                        to check whose site you are visiting.</p>
                    <h4>
                        Direct marketing</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you do not wish to receive direct marketing offers from Kmart, please call our
                        customer service centre on 0800 944 553.</p>
                    <h4>
                        Kmart and Coles Group Limited Privacy Policies and Practices</h4>
                    <p>
                        From time to time and in line with customer expectations and legislative changes,
                        our privacy policies and procedures will be reviewed and, if appropriate, updated.</p>
                    <h4>
                        About cookies and how they work</h4>
                    <p>
                        When you interact with us on the internet, our system will automatically send you
                        a "cookie". A cookie is a small amount of information sent from a web server to
                        your computer, enabling your computer to be recognised while the current <b>Session</b>
                        lasts. It is used to handle your <em>Session</em> and contains a unique number only.
                        This number becomes invalid as soon as your <b>Session</b> ends. Usually 30 minutes
                        after you left the site or you closed your browser.</p>
