<p><span class="subheadPrivacy">Privacy Statement </span></p>
<p><span class="subheadPrivacy">Below is a privacy statement that applies to Kmart. 
  </span></p>
<p><span class="bodycopyPrivacy"><span class="subheadPrivacy">You know us - you 
  can trust us </span><br>
  At Kmart, we understand and share our customers' and employees concerns about 
  how personal information is collected, used and shared. We want to assure you 
  that we will always handle personal information securely and carefully. We are 
  committed to safeguarding your information; this means that, among other things, 
  we will comply with all applicable Australian privacy laws and ensure our staff 
  are aware of their obligations. </span></p>
<p class="bodycopyPrivacy"><span class="bodycopyPrivacy"><span class="subheadPrivacy">Why 
  we collect information </span><br>
  We may collect information to deliver products or services to complete other 
  transactions and better understand our customers requirements and preferences. 
  This information enables us to personalise and improve our service and in particular 
  to provide offers that are of greater interest or benefit. </span></p>
<p><span class="bodycopyPrivacy"><span class="subheadPrivacy">How we collect this 
  information</span><br>
  When a customer places an order and/or register their details with us, we store 
  that information for future reference. This saves time when customers shop with 
  us again, as we do not have to re-enter customer details. Sometimes we may add 
  customers personal information with information from external sources. This 
  is mainly done to verify the accuracy of the information we have and, again, 
  to personalise and improve our service. </span></p>
<p><span class="bodycopyPrivacy"><span class="subheadPrivacy">What we collect 
  </span><br>
  The personal information we collect is in most cases supplied when customers 
  register details, place an order or provide feedback to us. Generally, the information 
  we collect includes customer name, address, delivery address, phone number and 
  e-mail address. We will sometimes obtain other details, such as age. Through 
  business partners such as FlyBuys and GE Capital Finance, who administer our 
  store cards, we also have access to purchasing information. </span></p>
<p class="bodycopyPrivacy"><span class="bodycopyPrivacy"><span class="subheadPrivacy">Who 
  we may share your information with </span><br>
  We will often need to pass personal details such as name and address to companies 
  who perform parts of our service delivery. This includes organisations such 
  as major delivery companies, out-sourced call centres, mail houses and third 
  party fulfilment contractors. In special circumstances, for example if we sell 
  our business or a substantial part of our business, your information may be 
  transferred as part of that sale. We will not use customer/employee information 
  for purposes unrelated to the services we provide, unless we first obtain your 
  consent. From time to time, we may provide aggregated and "de-identified" information 
  to other business partners for various purposes. If you would like to access 
  your personal information, please e-mail your request to Customer Satisfaction 
  Compliance Manager or contact our customer service department on <a href="mailto:Customer.Satisfaction@Kmart.com.au">Customer.Satisfaction@Kmart.com.au</a> 
  </span></p>
<p><span class="bodycopyPrivacy"><span class="subheadPrivacy">Security </span><br>
  We will take all reasonable steps to store your personal information securely. 
  Only specific employees in our customer service, marketing, human resources, 
  store systems and IT areas have access to our customers' and employee personal 
  information, and only under strict controls and procedures. </span></p>
