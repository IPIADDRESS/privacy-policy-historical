    <div class="text-terms">
        Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.

Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new people and places in the kgb.com network. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.
