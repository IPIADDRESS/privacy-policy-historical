  third parties?</strong></p>
<p> Our website contains a variety of content and functionality and may provide 
  links to other third party websites, including our affiliate websites. Despite

  does not apply to other portions of our internal network or to any external

  and accessing your account. You may also ask us to remove your personal information 
  from our station’s records, electronic or otherwise. We will usually be 
  glad to update your personal information where appropriate, but we reserve the 
  right to use personal information obtained previously to verify your identity 
  or take other actions that we believe are appropriate. </p>
<a name="quest8"></a>
<p><strong>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</strong></p>
<p> The security and confidentiality of your personal information is extremely 
  important to us. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial 
  procedures to protect your personal information. However, no security measures 
  are impenetrable, and transmissions over the Internet are never 100% secure 
  or error-free. As a result, we do not, and cannot, guarantee the security, accuracy, 
  or completeness of personal information.</p>
<p>Also, it is your responsibility to safeguard any username or password that 
  you may have received in connection with our website, and to notify us if you 
  ever suspect that the security and confidentiality of your username or password

<p><strong>Do we collect personal information from or about children? </strong></p>
<p>We recognize the particular importance of protecting the privacy of children. 
  We are committed to protecting children’s privacy on the Internet and 
  we comply fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). 
  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age 
  of 13. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us 
  via our website, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us using our email 
  address below and we will delete the personal information about the child from 
  our records. In the event that we otherwise learn that we have collected any 
  personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information 
  from our records.</p>
<p> Our website may enable parents or guardians to submit information about their 
  child under the age of 13 for purposes of participating in programs, such as 
  a weather kids program. In this case, we only request the types of personal 
  information necessary for participation in the program, which may include the 
  child’s name, age, city, and a photograph of the child. This information 
  would be used only for purposes of the program.</p>
