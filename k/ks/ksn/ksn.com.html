<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>New Vision Television, a Delaware limited liability company, and its affiliates and subsidiaries, which includes KSNW (collectively known as "Company"), strongly believes in maintaining the privacy of nonpublic information we collect from individuals who visit our web site (the “Website”). We want you to understand how and why we collect, use and disclose the personal information about you on our Website. This Privacy Policy provides you with information concerning our practices and procedures as they relate specifically to information we collect at the Website. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us through other means; for example, at a live event, via mail, or via telephone. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. By visiting this Website, you agree that your visit, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy. If you have additional questions or would like further information on this topic, please feel free to write to news@ksn.com. We may update our Privacy Policy periodically, so please check back here for the latest version of our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong></p>

<p>We are strongly committed to preserving online privacy for all of our Website visitors, including children. This Website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children or sell products to children. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13, knowingly allow anyone under 13 to register with our Website or to provide any other personally identifying information. If you're under 13, please do not provide us with any personally identifying information about yourself (such as your name, your email address or your phone number).</p>

<p><strong>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE ON THIS WEBSITE</strong></p>

<p>The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information (for example, your name and address) that you voluntarily supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2) information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as visitors navigate through our sites, use our services such as free email, or read our email newsletters. In some cases, it is an agent or affiliate of ours that collects the information on our behalf. Third party providers featured on or linked to by our Website, such as vendors of products and services offered through our Website, may be gathering the same kinds of information.</p>

<p>You are not required to provide any non-public personally identifiable information on this Website. We gather customer information you may volunteer when inquiring about our products and services or when using our products and services. New Vision and our business partners use this information only for the purposes of inquiry follow-up or for operational delivery of products and services.</p>

<p>We do not collect any non-public personally identifiable information about you at our Website unless you choose to provide it to us voluntarily. We define “non-public personally identifiable information” as information that is unique to you or a third party and might include your name, phone number, company name, company address, insurance policy number, account username or password. If you encounter a window or page that requests information that you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that window or page.</p>

<p>If you do provide us with non-public personally identifiable information, we will only use it for the purposes described where it is collected, and we will not sell, license, transmit or disclose this information outside of New Vision or its affiliates unless (1) you expressly authorize us to do so, (2) it is necessary to allow our trusted service providers or agents to provide services for us, (3) in order to provide our products or services to you, (4) it is disclosed to entities that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other entities with whom we have joint marketing agreements that obligate such entities to maintain the privacy of your non-public personally identifiable information, or (5) otherwise as we are required or permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>EMAIL</strong></p>

<p>We appreciate your questions and comments about our Website, products and services and welcome your email messages to mailbox(es) listed on our Website. We will share your messages with those within our organization who are most capable of addressing the issues contained in your message. We will keep a copy of your message until we have had an opportunity to address your concerns. We may archive your message for a certain period of time or discard it, but your email address will not be used for any other purpose.</p>

<p><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</strong></p>

<p>Security is a top priority at the Website. When you submit sensitive information to our Website, your information is protected both online and offline. We restrict access to non-public personally identifiable information collected about you at our Website to our employees, New Vision’s and our affiliates' employees, or others who need to know that information to provide services to you or in the course of conducting our normal business operations. We maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect non-public personally identifiable information. We protect our databases with various physical, technical and procedural measures and we restrict access to your information by unauthorized persons. We also advise all New Vision and KSNW employees, service providers, agents and affiliates about their responsibility to protect customer data and we provide them with appropriate guidelines for adhering to our company's business ethics standards and confidentiality policies.</p>

<p><strong>REGISTRATION INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>To make use of certain features on our Website (such as to receive email newsletters, or post a classified ad), visitors need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may also ask for information from those who buy products or services or conduct other transactions on our Website. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, gender, age, zip code or credit card number, and we might request information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like.) The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our Website to your interests and make them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce transactions that may be made available on our Website. The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we need, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our Website. For example, we can't send you email alerting you to a new service we're offering, or breaking news that may interest you if you don't tell us what you're interested in and give us your email address.</p>

<p><strong>CONTESTS AND OTHER PROMOTIONS</strong></p>

<p>From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions on our Website. If you enter one of these promotions, you'll have to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) so that we can contact you if you win. We may share this information with New Vision, our affiliates and with any co-sponsor of the promotion (we will identify any co-sponsor in the official rules for the promotion). If you don't want us to collect the information requested in the registration form or to provide it to New Vision, our affiliates or contest co-sponsors, please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes.</p>

<p><strong>EMAIL NEWSLETTERS</strong></p>

<p>We may also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to email newsletters on topics that we believe are of interest to our visitors. If you have opted to receive a particular newsletter, you may always unsubscribe later if you decide not to receive further mailings of the newsletter from us. See "Opting Out" below.</p>

<p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>

<p>To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we use a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, if you will, that resides on your computer. A cookie is a piece of information which a web server may place on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve the user experience and have not been known to transmit computer viruses or otherwise harm your computer. Many cookies last only through a single website session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them.</p>

<p>The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our Website. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. Our cookies do not gather non-public personally identifiable information. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or services through our Website may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control. We use cookies to help us tailor our Website to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. For example, we use cookies to avoid showing you the same ad, repeatedly, during a single visit. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our Website visited by our users. We can build a better Website if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to our Website.</p>

<p>We may occasionally use other companies to set cookies on our websites and gather cookie information for us. In some cases, we may also use another company to operate web servers or process credit card purchases for our website. We use the cookie information gathered by these companies in the same manner as stated above.</p>

<p><strong>OTHER METHODS OF COLLECTING INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Our web pages may contain electronic images (called "single-pixel GIFs" or "web beacons") that allow us and our vendors to count users who have visited particular pages or to access certain cookies. We may use these tools and other technologies to recognize which pages users visit, and which links they click on. These features may also be included in our email newsletters so that we can learn which messages have been opened and acted upon. We may also be able to verify your online purchases from us or from third party sites that have agreed to share such information with us.</p>

<p><strong>BROWSER LEVEL INFORMATION AND IP ADDRESSES</strong></p>

<p>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our Website, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the website that referred you, and your IP address. (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. Your IP address does not tell us who you are.) We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our Website to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our Website.</p>

<p><strong>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</strong></p>

<p>The ads appearing on this Website are delivered to you by Clickability, our Web hosting partner. Information about your visits to this Website, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal in-formation), is used to serve ads to you.</p>

<p><strong>THIRD PARTY COOKIES</strong></p>

<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this Website, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Advertisers</p>

<p>Without your permission, we will not share non-public personally identifiable information you provide when registering on our Website with advertisers. We may, however, take the information you provide and aggregate it with data from all the other people that use this Website and associated services. Then we will use that pool of information to inform our advertisers about our audience without identifying you personally.</p>

<p>Vendors and Service Providers</p>

<p>To make our sites more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers ("Provider Partners"). Our chat, email newsletters, email services and online classifieds for example, may be made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services. In some instances, our Provider Partners will have the same access to your information as we do. Their use of the information will be subject to the terms of their respective privacy policies, which you can find on their websites.</p>

<p>Our Affiliates</p>

<p>We may share the information that we collect from you with our affiliates (including New Vision) so that we and they can provide you with products and services provided by these entities that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>

<p><strong>STATISTICAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic that visits various pages within our sites, and the habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated information does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to third parties as we see fit.</p>

<p><strong>SITES TO WHICH WE LINK</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy only address the use and disclosure of information we collects online through this Website, not information that may be collected through other sources. For useful information and/or your convenience, we may provide links to other websites and web pages that we do not control the content or privacy policy. Please carefully review the approach these sites take to your privacy before you use them or provide them with information.</p>

<p>We cannot be responsible for the privacy or security practices of any websites or pages not under our control and we do not endorse any of these websites or pages, the services or products described or offered on such sites or pages, or any of the content contained on those sites or pages. We assume no liability for any unauthorized actions of third parties or accidental transmission errors that may disclose information about you, and we are not responsible for these other sites' privacy practices, which may be different from our privacy practices.</p>

<p><strong>OTHER DISCLOSURES</strong></p>

<p>We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our sites, the public, our customers, or our company and its employees, agents, partners and affiliates. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that our company, or the bulk of our assets relating to this Website, is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets. Of course, any information that you include in a message that you post in any forum or other public posting area will be available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to know your name or email address, please do not include them in any message that you post publicly.</p>

<p><strong>SHOPPING</strong></p>

<p>For e-commerce transactions that may be made available on this Website, when you are ready to make a purchase on our Website, we will ask you to provide us with certain information, including your contact details (such as your name, address, telephone and email), and your billing information (such as your credit card number and the date that your card expires). We may also ask you to provide additional information such as unique identifiers (such as your date of birth), and registration information (login name and password). You will be able to review, update, or delete the information you have provided us (except, of course any information that we do not store) at any time by accessing your account on our Website.</p>

<p>We will use the information you provide us to process your transaction and to contact you regarding your purchase if necessary. We will share this information with our Provider Partners to the extent necessary to facilitate your purchase (for purposes such as customer service, verification, fulfillment and billing purposes). We will not sell or rent your personal billing information to any third party. We may share non-financial information with our Provider Partners in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you consent (for example, by checking a box or by some other means), we will make your information available to third parties so that they, we, or both may contact you directly regarding special offers, promotions, products or services that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p><strong>CREDIT CARD INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>We are very sensitive to the importance of our role in protecting the security of your transaction(s). Consequently, we use high grade encryption and the https security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us. Companies we work with to process credit card transactions also use high grade encryption and security protocols. Moreover, regular audits are conducted to ensure the privacy, security and appropriate processing of your information on our site.</p>

<p><strong>RIGHT TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>

<p>If you register with our Website, you will have the opportunity to review, update, or delete the information you have provided us at any time (except, of course, any information that we do not store). Keeping your information accurate and up to date is important to us. Once you register, you can review your account information at anytime, by clicking on the login link on the Website. If you have questions about your account or would like to modify your account or information, please contact us by email at news@ksn.com. If you remove your registration information completely, you may not be able to continue using certain services that require registration (such as free email).</p>

<p><strong>OPTING OUT</strong></p>

<p>You agree that we may use your information to contact you for customer service, to inform you of important changes or additions to our Website or the services offered over our Website and to send you administrative notices or any communications relevant to your use of our Website. If you do not wish to receive these notices, please do not register with this Website. If you have subscribed to one of our email newsletters, you will always have the opportunity to unsubscribe from future mailings (for example, by clicking on an unsubscribe link in an email newsletter or by going back to our Website). Your email address will be removed from our email list. Please allow us a reasonable period of time in order to satisfy your request.</p>

<p>If you have submitted your information on a page provided in conjunction with one of our Provider Partners, the information you submit may be jointly maintained by us and the Provider Partner. If you decide to opt out on our Website, you may also need to contact the Provider Partner separately to request the Provider Partner to remove your information from its database.</p>

<p><strong>STORAGE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>All information gathered on our Website is stored within a database operated by us or by a contractor on our behalf. Sensitive information, such as your password is encoded for storage. For e-commerce transactions that may be made available on our Website, in certain instances we may transmit your billing information using encryption. Encryption scrambles your credit card number and personal information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>

<p>We may change this Website Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time. The most recent version of the Website Privacy Policy is reflected by the version date located at the bottom of this Website Privacy Policy. This Website Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal right in or on behalf of any party.</p>

<p><strong>CONTACTING US</strong></p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Website Privacy Policy or would like to learn more about how we protect privacy, please write to us at KSNW-TV, 833 N. Main St. Wichita, KS 67203 or email to news@ksn.com.</p>
