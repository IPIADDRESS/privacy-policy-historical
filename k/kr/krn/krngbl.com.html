<p>KerangBulu respects your privacy. This policy explains how KerangBulu   will treat information that it may obtain from you as you make use of   the KerangBulu.com site. The owners and operators of KerangBulu.com   ("KerangBulu") provide the KerangBulu.com site, the KerangBulu Blog, KerangBulu   Radio, and all services provided through them (the "Service") subject to   the terms of this Privacy Policy. By using the Service, you accept and   agree to this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>The Privacy Policy may change from time to time, without notice   other than appearing on the KerangBulu website. Your continued use of the   Service constitutes your agreement to all revisions to the TOS.  This   Privacy Policy was last revised on 10th of May 2011.</p>
<h2>The KerangBulu Service and Third Party Sites</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the KerangBulu Service. The   Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or   controlled by KerangBulu. KerangBulu has no control over, and assumes no   responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any   third party website. You agree that you are responsible for reviewing   and understanding the privacy policies (if any) of any third party   websites you may access through this Service. By using this Service, you   release KerangBulu from any and all liability arising from your use of any   third party website to which a link may be provided.</p>
<h2>Information Collected by this Service</h2>
<p>When you use the Service, we may collect passive information about   your visit. Passive information is any form of aggregate data,   navigational data, tracking data, click-stream data, or historical data.   It may include the domain name of your internet service provider (e.g.,   whether you logged on from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data   (e.g., the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through   to the KerangBulu website) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Firefox   browser on a Macintosh platform). We use this information to track how   users are accessing and using the Service.</p>
<p>In addition, when you use the Service we generally collect the IP   Address of the computer you are using to access it. (An IP, or "Internet   Protocol," address is a unique number associated with your computer,   that may be communicated to other computers and servers when you use the   Internet.) We use this information for purposes of security and   anti-fraud protection.</p>
<p>KerangBulu also uses cookies and/or web beacons. (A cookie is a small   amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and   stored on your computer's hard drive, and that may be accessed when you   use a website or other online service. A web beacon is a small,   transparent graphic image placed on a website, which allows the site to   record the actions of a visitor opening the page that contains the   beacon.)</p>
<p>We may use cookies or web beacons to: (1) determine whether users   of the Service are unique, or whether the same user is using the Service   on multiple occasions; (2) help deliver advertisements; (3) track usage   throughout various components of the KerangBulu website and the Service   (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the   Service, etc.); (4) store your agreement to the terms and conditions for   entering and using the Service; (5) monitor aggregate metrics such as   total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.</p>
<p>These kinds of information do not, on their own, personally   identify you. However, they can potentially be combined with information   obtained from other sources in order to identify you. KerangBulu does not   ordinarily seek or obtain personally identifying information about users   from others. It does reserve the right to seek such information in the   event of a violation of the KerangBulu <a href="http://indo.kerangbulu.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, in the event of a dispute between KerangBulu and you, or if required by law to do so.</p>
<h2>Content You Submit KerangBulu to or Communicate Using the Service</h2>
<p>KerangBulu may allow you to submit and communicate audio and video   content, text, links, and other content ("User Content"). Except with   respect to User Content that you are expressly allowed and enabled to   keep private using the KerangBulu Community uploading function, User   Content that you submit to KerangBulu or communicate using the Service,   including any personal information included in your User Content,   becomes publicly available and can be seen, collected, and used by   others. Once made public User Content cannot be made private again. In   addition, User Content you communicate using the Service may be   recorded, stored, copied and/or retransmitted by KerangBulu, including but   not limited to audio or video content submitted to the KerangBulu   Community, KerangBulu Blog and  calls made to KerangBulu Radio. You should not   submit or communicate any content using the Service that you do not   want to be seen, collected, or used by others. </p>
<p>In the process of posting User Content, you may be asked to   provide some personally identifying information, such as your name,   address, e-mail address, a password, and other documentation.  You may   also be asked to provide such information in order to use certain   features of the Service, including but not limited certain features of   the KerangBulu blog available only to registered users. </p>
<p>We will keep a record of the information you provide, including   your personally identifiable information. That information may be linked   in our records to other information you provide, including User   Content. We will not publically post your name or other personally   identifying information, and we will not provide such information to our   advertisers or business partners without your permission. However,    some of the information you provide in registering for and using the   KerangBulu Community feature will be displayed to other members of the   KerangBulu Community, and may become public.  In addition, we may disclose   the personally identifying information and documentation you provide in   some limited circumstances, as set forth below ("Permitted Disclosures   of Personal Information").</p>
<h2>Use of Visitor Information Collected by the Service</h2>
<p>We do not share personally identifiable information about users of   the Service in the ordinary operation of the Service, unless you have   included such information in User Content that you submit or communicate   using the Service, such as through the KerangBulu Community feature. We   may obtain and merge information about users and usage of the Service   into aggregated data, which may then be used by us and/or shared with   advertisers or others. When we provide aggregated information to outside   companies, they will not be able to identify you or contact you based   on that data. </p>
<h2>Usage Information - Collection and Use by Advertisers and Others</h2>
<p>KerangBulu allows other companies to display advertisements using the   Service. These companies use technology to deliver advertisements you   see using the Service directly to your browser. In doing so, they may   automatically receive your IP address. Other companies that place   advertising using the Service may have the ability to use cookies and/or   web beacons to collect information, including information about your   usage of the Service. We do not control the processes that advertisers   use to collect information. However, IP addresses, cookies and web   beacons alone generally cannot be used to identify individuals, only   machines. Therefore, advertisers and others whose advertisements or   content may be provided through the Service generally will not know who   you are unless you provide additional information to them, by responding   to an advertisement, by entering into an agreement with them, or by   some other means.</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly allow children to use the Service, and all   users of the Service must confirm that they are at least 21 years old.   We do not collect or maintain information from those we actually know   are under 21, and no part of our Service is designed to attract anyone   under 21. If we become aware that anyone under the age of 21 is using   the Service, their access to the Service will be terminated.</p>
<h2>Permitted Disclosures of Personal Information</h2>
<p>KerangBulu generally does not collect personally identifiable   information (data such as your name, email address, password, and the   content of your communications) unless you submit or communicate User   Content through the Service, or register with us in order to use certain   features of the Service. KerangBulu will not disclose any personally   identifiable information it collects or obtains except: (1) as described   in the KerangBulu <a href="http://indo.kerangbulu.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> or this Privacy Policy; (2) after obtaining your permission to a   specific use or disclosure; (3) if KerangBulu is required to do so in order   to comply with any valid legal process or governmental request (such as   a court order, search warrant, subpoena, civil discovery request, or   statutory requirement); (4) as required to protect KerangBulu's property,   safety, or operations, or the property or safety of others; or (5) as   otherwise required by law.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Some components of the Service may use security measures to   protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information that is   transmitted through the Service. However, no data transmission over the   Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure. As a   result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable   information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information   you transmit, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h2>Questions or Concerns</h2>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about KerangBulu's   Privacy Policy and use of personal information, please contact us using   our <a href="http://indo.kerangbulu.com/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
