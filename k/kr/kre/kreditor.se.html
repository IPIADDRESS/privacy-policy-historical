You can always withdraw your consent if you do not want us to use your data in this way, free of charge, by sending an email to privacy[at]klarna.co.uk.</p>

                <p><strong>Disclosure of your Information</strong></p>

                <p>We may share your information with selected third parties, including the following:</p>

                <p><strong>Klarna group companies, suppliers and subcontractors.</strong> Klarna may transfer your personal data to other companies in the Klarna Group, suppliers and subcontractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you, and they will only process your personal data for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.</p>

                <p><strong>Merchants.</strong> Klarna may share your personal data with the e-store at which you made your purchase. If so, all personal data disclosed to the merchant will be subject to the merchant's privacy policies and practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;We do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.</p>

                <p><strong>Credit reference agencies.</strong> You agree that your personal data may be shared with credit reference agencies for the purpose of assessing your credit score if you are offered, and apply for, any of Klarna's payment methods.</p>

                <p><strong>Divestment.</strong>&nbsp;We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>In the event that Klarna sells or buys any business or assets, in which case Klarna may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>
                <li>If Klarna AB or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Where Klarna stores your personal data</strong></p>

                <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Klarna will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely.</p>

                <p>Klarna may use electronic communication channels (e.g. email and SMS) in all communication with you.</p>

                <p><strong>What we DO NOT do with your data</strong></p>

                <p>We will not sell or otherwise distribute your personal details to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.</p>

                <p><strong>Klarna Checkout</strong></p>

                <p>Klarna Checkout offers you an easy order process adjusted to your personal needs, which makes it easier for you to place an order online with our partner merchants. If you have used Klarna’s services previously there might be information stored about you, e.g. for customer administration, documentation and similar purposes declared at time of using the service. Where available, Klarna may also use such information when you use Klarna Checkout, to confirm your identity, prevent unauthorised use and personalise the experience of Klarna Checkout.</p>

                <p>Klarna Checkout automatically adapts the risk assessment and by that also the service every time you purchase, making sure that you do not need to enter more information than necessary. In some cases your previously approved address will be pre-filled as soon as you have entered your email address and your postal code.</p>

                <p>By clicking on the "I agree" button you agree that we may reuse the data you previously provided to us and we may carry out limited credit searches to help us decide which payment options to offer you. These limited credit searches will be visible to you and to Klarna on your credit file, but they will not affect your chances of obtaining credit in the future. It is only if you are offered and then actively apply for Pay Monthly, that Klarna will carry out a search which may be seen by other lenders and which will affect your credit rating (see below). Unless you apply for Pay Monthly, the record of the limited search Klarna will make will only be visible to you and to Klarna. The credit reference agencies will supply us with credit information, as well as information from the Electoral Register. We will use this information for confirmation purposes. We may use credit scoring methods to assess your application and to verify your identity.</p>

                <p><strong>Klarna Payment Methods</strong></p>

                <p>When choosing to pay with one of Klarna’s payment methods (e.g. Pay After Delivery or Pay Monthly), Klarna may also, where applicable, collect additional historical information about purchases and payment behaviour from the estore that you purchase.</p>

                <p>If you choose to apply for Pay Monthly, we will make a full credit search that will be visible to other lenders. We will ask for, record and use the following types of information:</p>

                <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial information – we might ask you about your annual household income, outgoings, and for other similar information and may seek to verify the information you provide against your credit record with a credit reference agency; and</p>

                <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Positive and negative information about your credit history and potential negative payment remarks (where available).</p>

                <p>Automated decisions are used to decide on which payment option to offer and whether to offer you the opportunity to apply for credit. You may apply for a manual reassessment of an automated decision, by contacting Klarna Customer Service.</p>

                <p>Details of our credit agreement and data on non-contractual payment behaviour regarding uncontested claims may be submitted to the credit bureaus with due regard to the interests of Klarna, the credit bureau and the debtor. Furthermore, data relating to the relevant purchase may be transferred if a debt is sold to an external debt collection agency. You have the right of access to your personal records held by the credit bureaus and we will supply their names and address upon request to privacy[at]klarna.co.uk.</p>

                <p><strong>Use of links</strong></p>

                <p>Klarna Checkout may contain links to other websites. If you visit other websites Klarna’s user terms will no longer be valid. We recommend that you read the user terms applicable for those websites before using them.</p>
