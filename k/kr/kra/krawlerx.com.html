							<p>Welcome to the Krawler Network, a personal online networking service operated 
by Krawler Inc and/or wholly-owned subsidiaries ("Krawler") which includes 
Krawler software, content, related documentation, information on the Krawler 
domain, and information made available by users to each other on the Internet 
through the Krawler Software (collectively, the Service) . Your privacy is 
important to us and we have designed the Service to give you choices about the 
personal information available. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use 
and share your personal identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy 
carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal 
information as outlined in the Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may update 
the Privacy Policy and we will post a notice of significant changes on the web

such changes to the Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>What We Collect</h2>
<p>When you register to become a member of the Service, we collect your name, email

This additional information is voluntary and can be made available to other members.</p>

<p>When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the 
Krawler service, we collect and maintain the information associated with those 
messages, including email addresses and content on secure servers. As with any

<p>You understand and agree that Krawler may access, preserve, and disclose your

other personal information. You can edit your profile and other information

privacy settings using the Krawler client to limit viewing certain information 
to yourself, your friends, friends of friends or make the information available 
to everyone.</p>

<p>At any time, you can terminate your account which will remove your profile 
and other personal information from view. Contact Krawler to terminate your 
account or for any other questions about your personal information.</p>

<h2>Transfer of Information</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a 
transfer of ownership of Krawler, such as acquisition by or merger with another 
company. In such an event, Krawler will notify you before information about you 
is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Others' Information</h2>
<p>If you invite another person to join Krawler, we will ask for that person's 
name and email address. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, 
remind that person that he or she has been invited to join Krawler. All 
invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from 
Krawler. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to 
comply with valid legal process.</p>

to improve the quality of our service and make the service easier to use for
