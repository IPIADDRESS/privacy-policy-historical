This website is owned and operated by Kraft Foods.  Here at Kraft, we
recognize that many visitors to our site are concerned about the information
they provide to us, and how we treat that information.  So we've developed a
Privacy Policy based on guidelines from the Council of Better Business
Bureaus and our own beliefs about what's right in this sensitive area.  We
may update the Policy from time to time, so please check in occasionally.  
<p>
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:

<b>Our Policy</b>
</p><p>
At our site, we don't collect personally-identifiable information from
individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly.  This
means we don't require you to register or provide information to us in order
to view our site.  If you register in order to use the "Recipe Box," "Simple
Meal-Planner," or "Recipes By E-Mail" features of our site, we use the
information you supply for the purpose of providing the services you've
requested.  If you specifically agreed to follow-up contacts by us or asked
to be put on our mailing list  when you registered, we may also contact you
from time to time. You can always change your preference for follow-up
contacts just by e-mailing us at any time.  We don't share any information
you give us with anyone outside of Kraft Foods.  
</p><p>
In the e-mail section of our site, we ask for some personally-identifiable
information, such as your name and phone number.  We use this information
only if we need to contact you directly because our attempts to contact you
by e-mail were unsuccessful.  We don't use the information internally for
other purposes, and we don't share it with anyone outside of Kraft Foods.
We don't use your e-mail address for any purpose other than responding to
the message you've sent.  
</p><p>
Our site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we
are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases.
If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of
conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner).  We
don't share the information you give us with anyone outside of Kraft Foods.  
</p><p>
<b>Cookies</b>
</p><p>
Like most companies, we use "cookie" technology on our web site.  When you
log in, the cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new
visitor.  The cookie doesn't track any personal information about you or
provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any
information from your computer.  We do use the cookie to help us identify
site features and recipes in which you have the greatest interest, so that
we can provide more of what you may want.
