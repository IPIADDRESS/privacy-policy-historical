<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>Safeguarding the privacy of your personal information is of utmost importance to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, by email, over the internet or any other electronic medium. We will hold personal information, for as long as we have a business relationship with you, in secure computer storage facilities, and we take the necessary measures to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>
<p>When we consider that personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records. However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period of time (after you cease being our client). For example, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws which require us to retain the following, for a period of 5 years after our business relationship with you has ended.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A copy of the records we used in order to comply with our client due diligence obligations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting evidence and records of transactions with you and your relationship with us.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the personal information we hold in the form of a recorded information, by telephone, electronically or otherwise, will be held in line with local regulatory requirements (i.e. 5 years after our business relationship with you has ended or longer if you have legitimate interests (such as handling a dispute with you)). If you have opted out of receiving marketing communications we will hold your details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive these communications.</p>
<p>We may keep your data for longer than 5 years if we cannot delete if for legal, regulatory or technical reasons.</p>
