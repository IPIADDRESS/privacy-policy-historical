<h3>2. Information we may collect from you, why we need it and how we use it</h3>

<li>What data we collect: When you register we may collect your name, username, email address, password (encrypted) and IP address.</li>
<li>Why we need this data and how we use it: We may collect your name to personalize the services we offer to you, and collect your username and password in order to provide you with access to the web based control panel and to our downloadable VPN software. We collect your email address in case you forget your password or wish to receive email newsletters. Your IP address is logged by us so that we can prevent any spam, fraud or abuse of our Site and our services.  In general, we use the data we collect to provide our services to you, prevention of fraud and abuse. From time to time we may email you news, updates and sales offers which you can easily opt out of receiving by clicking the "unsubscribe" in the relevant email.</li>
<li>How long do we store this data:  If you continue to use one of our services, we will store your registration data for as long as you are using one of our services or have an active account, and for up to two years after that. We may keep your registration data for an extended period as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</li>
</ul>

<p>On request for payment details:</p>

<p>If you opt to pay for use of our services, we will use a third party payment processor to take payment from you. These third parties are properly regulated and authorised to handle your payment information and are prohibited from using your personal data for promotional purposes or for any other purposes other than providing these services to us.</p>

<ul>
<li>What data we collect: We collect payment information, which will vary depending on the payment method chosen by you, but may include your name, address and credit card information. We also collect geo-IP data to determine your country of origin. We never handle or store complete credit card numbers, as this is done on our behalf by our payment processors. If you are a business user, you may choose to provide additional details, such as your company name, address and EU VAT number (if applicable).</li>
<li>Why we need this data and how we use it: We store this information as we require a record of your payment for accounting, taxation and invoicing purposes and to manage your account. We may also use your payment information to detect and prevent fraud.</li>
<li>How long do we store this data: If you continue to use one of our services, we will store your payment data for as long as you are using one of our services or have an active account, and for up to two years after that. We may keep your payment data for an extended period as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are not responsible for any third party payment provider handling your transaction and you should refer to the third party payment provider's privacy policy to see how they use your data.</p>

<p>If you contact us:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you contact us through our website for any reason (e.g. by email or using our live-chat functionality provided by Zopim (a ZenDesk subsidiary)) we will generally store these communications and your IP address for up to 6 months, unless we are required, for legal reasons or under exceptional circumstances, to retain this information for an extended period. Additionally, our live-chat provider, Zopim, may collect certain information about you, including your IP address, and such information is subject to <a href="https://www.zopim.com/security">Zopim’s security policy</a> and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/company/privacy/">Zopim’s privacy policy</a>.</li>
<li>When you contact us outside of our website (e.g. using individual corporate email addresses or by phone, including our help desk), we may store your communication for as long as necessary to provide you services or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  If we speak with you by phone, we may, with your consent, record the phone calls, both for quality control purposes and to provide you the option of our sharing, with your explicit permission and to the people you instruct, the recording of the phone conversation as part of the services we provide.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use our Web proxy service:</p>

<ul>
<li>What data we collect: This is a free service and the only data we store through log files are website logs. This log details your IP address, the address of the website you visit, date, time and the files/sites you viewed via the web proxy. We do not link this data to your personal data.</li>
<li>Why we need this data and how we use it: The website logs are needed to tell us what websites and files you have accessed via our network.</li>
<li>How long do we store this data: We store these logs for 30 days.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use our VPN service:</p>

<ul>
<li>What data we collect: We will store a time stamp and IP address when you connect and disconnect to our VPN service, the amount data transmitted (up- and download) during your session together with the IP address of the individual VPN server used by you. We do not store details of, or monitor, the websites you connect to when using our VPN service. We collect aggregated statistical (non-personal) data about the usage of our mobile apps and software.</li>
<li>Why we need this data and how we use it: We need this data to can monitor the performance and usage of our VPN Service, for example it enables us to sort server nodes by the number of users connected, to limit your account to one concurrent IP address per VPN connection (to prevent shared accounts), resource analytics (to carry out usage analysis for administrative purposes) and to prevent abuse and fraud.</li>
<li>How long do we store this data: This data is stored on our system for between 2 and 3 months unless we are required, for legal reasons or under exceptional circumstances (including our own investigations of fraud or abuse), to retain this data for an extended period.  For more information about logging on our VPN Service, please see our separate <a href="legal/logging">VPN Logging Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use our Anonymous email service:</p>

<ul>
<li>What data we collect: We store the date and time of registration for the anonymous email service, your IP address, password, your actual email address (if you choose to supply it), and of course the actual emails themselves.</li>
<li>Why we need this data and how we use it: We need this data so that you can receive emails (although please note that you can't send emails). You can use this anonymous email service as a temporary email inbox for when websites you do not necessarily trust that require an email address.</li>
<li>How long do we store this data: You can delete your account and emails at any time but your registration details are stored for no more than 2 years following the deletion of your account to be used as an identifier in case of any potential legal issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use our IP:PORT premium service:</p>

<ul>
<li>What data we collect: We store the date and time of order for the IP:PORT Proxy List premium service, and the email address provided to us for receipt of the proxy list emails and your payment information.</li>
<li>Why we need this data and how we use it: We need this data so that we can send you emails containing the proxy lists and so we have a record of the transaction for accounting purposes.</li>
<li>How long do we store this data: You can delete your account at any time but your email address will be stored by us for no more than 2 years after you have deleted your account.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not share any of your personal data with anyone except in the circumstances referred to in section 5 (Disclosure of Your Information). Privax does not direct its Sites or Services to or knowingly collect personal data from persons under the age of 18.

<h3>3. Cookies</h3>

<p>Please see our Cookie and Third Party Tracking and Analytics Policy <a href="legal/cookie-policy">here</a></p>

<h3>4. Where we store your personal data</h3>

<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area. By submitting your Personal Data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<h3>5. Disclosure of your information</h3>

<p>We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. As described in the introduction to this Privacy Policy, Privax is part of the AVG Group, and we may disclose your data subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy to any member of the AVG Group.  While some members of the AVG Group have separate privacy policies, to the extent these privacy policies differ, we will ensure that any personal data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy and shared with another member of the AVG Group is treated according to terms at least as strict as this Privacy Policy.  Please note that the AVG Group is comprised of companies and offices around the world. In order to do business around the globe, we may share your personal data across our offices and companies which may be in countries with different laws regarding the collection and use of personal data than the country we collected it from. Lastly, we may share your personal data:</p>

<ul>
<li>when necessary to deliver the product or service you require such as with a payment card provider who we use to process your credit card transaction;</li>
<li>when authorized by law or necessary to comply with a valid legal process;</li>
<li>when required to protect and defend the rights or property of the AVG Group, including the security of our products and services;</li>
<li>when necessary to protect the personal safety, property or other rights of the public, the AVG Group or its customers or employees; or</li>
<li>in connection with a sale of all or part of our business.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we receive a report from any person or organisation (including law enforcement) that leads us to suspect that your account has been used in connection with any wrong-doing, we may at our discretion suspend your account, but we will not disclose any personal information that may identify you unless we are legally compelled to do so. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will abide by this Privacy Policy with respect to any data collected by Privax, and any affected users will be informed if we transfer any personal data to a third party or if personal data becomes subject to a different privacy policy as a result.</p>

<h3>6. Your Rights with Respect to your Data; Emails</h3>

<p>The UK Data Protection Act 1998 gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Data Protection Act.  You have the right to ask us about the personal data we process about you, the purpose and nature of the processing, and to provide information on who we share it with. You have the right to request that we update, correct, or delete (assuming that this does not impact the services we are providing to you) your personal data at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@hidemyass.com">info@hidemyass.com</a>. Please note that we may reject requests which risk the privacy of others or are unreasonable or repetitive, or would require disproportionate effort. Unless you request us to delete your data, please note that we may keep your personal data for one year after you stop being a customer (but we typically keep your personal data no longer than is reasonably necessary given the purposes for which the data was collected). You have the right to opt-out of receiving certain emails at any time by following the relevant unsubscribe process outlined in the applicable email. Please be aware that our emails may include important or useful information about our services, and you may not be able to unsubscribe from certain transactional emails.</p>

<h3>7. Links to 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Sites; Other AVG Group Privacy Policies</h3>

<p>Periodically, our site or products may contain links to and from websites or other external destinations managed by third parties. If you follow a link to any of these destinations (like offers on mobile app stores etc.), please note that those sites have their own privacy policy. When you are on those sites you are subject to those policies, and should therefore read and understand them before you submit any personal data to those sites.</p>

<p>Certain other AVG Group companies may have different privacy policies, including the general <a href="http://www.avg.com/privacy">AVG Privacy Policy</a>, that govern information collected using those sites or from the applications those companies provide.  We invite you to read those privacy policies before deciding to use those sites and products.  This Privacy Policy will control with regard to information you provide us or we collect in connection with the use of the Privax services, regardless of which AVG Company is holding such information.</p>

<h3>8. Social Media Widgets; Social Media Logins</h3>

<p>Our web site includes social media login features that may collect certain information including but not limited to your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site if you log in using these features or are logged in from your social media account, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly (the “Features”). You are not required to log in to our site in order to use it, and you do not have to be logged into any social media account to access our website. The Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

<h3>9. Do Not Track</h3>

<p>Do Not Track (or DNT) is a preference you can set in your browser to let websites you visit know that you do not want websites to collect certain information about you.  Privax does not support the Do Not Track browser setting.  Privax does not track visitors to the Sites and therefore does not respond to DNT signals.</p>

<h3>10. Your California Privacy Rights</h3>

<p>Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83, California residents may request a notice describing what categories of personal customer information Privax shares with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates’ direct marketing purposes. To the extent applicable to Privax, such notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: Privax Ltd., Attn: Privacy Policy – 110 High Holborn, London, WC1V 6JS, UK. Please specify that you are requesting the California Privacy Rights Notice for Privax and allow at least 30 days for a response.</p>

If there have been significant changes, we will highlight any such changes, and will attempt to directly alert you when possible. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
