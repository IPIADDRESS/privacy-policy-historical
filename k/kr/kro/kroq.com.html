    WWW.KROQ.COM (“Site,” “us,” or “we”) is 
    the official website for Radio Station KROQ-FM, Los Angeles, California. (“Station”). 
    This Site is owned and operated by Infinity Broadcasting Corporation of Los 
    Angeles, (“Owner and Operator”). </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your privacy 
    is very important to us. Because we gather certain types of personally identifiable 
    information (“Personal Information”) from users of our website 
    and for various Station activities, operational and business purposes, we 
    feel you should know how we collect, use, disclose, manage, and store the 
    Personal Information that you may voluntarily provide us and the Personal 
    Information that is collected passively through the use of cookies or image 
    tags on our website. This Privacy Policy is a part of the Site’s <a href="/privacy/termsofuse.htm">Terms 
    of Use Agreement</a>, which is binding on all Site users. This Policy applies 
    only to the Personal Information collected by this Station and does not cover 
    any such information collected by its corporate parent(s), affiliates, or 
    any other company, unless specifically stated. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you do 
    not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Station’s 
    online or off-line activities and services that require you to provide your 
    Personal Information. (The type of Personal Information collected is listed 
    below.) This Policy provides information regarding your choices to either 
    Opt-out or Opt-in when your Personal Information is used for various promotional 
    and marketing purposes by the Station, Site, its corporate affiliates, and/or 
    our generous advertisers, sponsors, or promotional partners (collectively, 
    “Advertisers”). For example, for the Station, Site or our corporate 
    affiliates use of your Personal Information for marketing and promotional 
    purposes, we provide you with the right to Opt-out. However, the choice for 
    sharing your Personal Information with Advertisers may be different. Please 
    see details in the “Disclosure to Advertisers “ section below.

  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">YOUR CALIFORNIA 
    PRIVACY RIGHTS</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Residents 
    of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil 
    Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California 
    a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information 
    during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the 
    law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an 
    Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties 
    (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the 
    company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure 
    choice options. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This Station 
    qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy 
    and provides you with details on how you may Opt-out or Opt-in to the use 
    of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. 
    Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third 
    parties that received your Personal Information during the preceding year 
    for marketing purposes.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are 
    a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third 
    party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address 
    with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email 
    or postal mail). You may contact us in two ways. Send email to Privacy Administrator 
    at <a href="mailto:privacy@kroq.com">privacy@kroq.com</a>. Alternatively, 
    you may contact the Station at:<br>

  otherwise on the Site, all users must be at least 13 years of age and a legal 
  resident of the United States to participate in any activity that requires the 
  submission of Personal Information. This Site is designed and targeted to United 
  States (U.S.) audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the 
  laws of the United States. We make no representation that this Site is operated 
  in accordance with the laws or governed by other nations. By your participation 
  in our Site activities, you certify that you are at least 13 years of age and 
  located in the U.S. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside 
  of the U.S. and you participate in activities on this Site contrary to our policy 
  that only U.S. residents are eligible for certain activities, you do so at your 
  own risk and initiative, and are responsible for compliance with any applicable 
  local laws. Please be aware that any Personal Information you transfer to us 
  will be transferred to the U.S and subject to U.S. law. By using this Site, 
  participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal 
  Information, you consent to this transfer of Personal Information to the U.S., 
  and waive any claims that may arise under your own national laws. All users 
  of the Site are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal 
  Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe 
  in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. 
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  <p><font size="2">Your continued participation on this Site indicates your acceptance 
    of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management 
    and storage of your Personal Information as described below. We may from time 
    to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to 
    our online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format. 
    We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information 
    available from other sources, including information received from Advertisers, 
    or marketing companies. This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information 
    and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the 
    Site or a participant in Station activities. We reserve the right to revise 
    this policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to 
    you. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. Therefore, 
    we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy often. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">We use your Personal Information to provide you with the features, 
    services, or goods you request and to respond to billing and/or other such 
    questions related to the Station or Site. We will also use your Personal Information 
    to notify you about updates, new features, programming and activities on behalf 
    of the Station, Site, or our Advertisers that may be of interest to you. (We 
    explain below in the next section what our policy is for the collection, use 
    and disclosure of Personal Information to Advertisers.)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">We may also use your information for hiring, operational and 
    business purposes, or to find out how we can improve our Station and Site 
    via surveys or online tracking mechanisms. We use aggregate Personal Information 
    to help us to evaluate and modify existing services and features. We also 
    use your Personal Information to develop new services and features that may 
    be of interest to you. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">We will not sell, exchange, rent, lease or otherwise disclose 
    your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to other third 
    party marketers or any such persons that are not associated with the Station 
    as Advertisers unless it is necessary to: 1) conform to regulatory and legal 
    requirements or to comply with legal process; 2) to protect the safety and 
    security of our users, employees, or property; 3) to defend the rights of 
    the Site or the Station; or 4) to enforce the Terms of Use Agreement. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">We will share your Personal Information with our corporate 
    parents, Infinity Broadcasting Corporation (“Infinity”) or Viacom 
    Inc. (“Viacom”) and affiliated entities primarily for business 
    and operational purposes. On occasion, we will share your Personal Information 
    with Infinity or Viacom-related corporate entities for promotional and marketing 
    purposes. We will inform you when we conduct cross-promotional events between 
    our various stations or companies, and you will have the right to Opt-out 
    of such use. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">It is also necessary that we share your Personal Information 
    and Sensitive Personal Information with our operational service providers, 
    the specialists that provide internal support to Station operations and activities 
    and/or for Site design, development, hosting and operations including maintenance, 
    management, storage and/or fulfillment of our membership and e-mail clubs, 
    various contests, sweepstakes, services, events and online stores. We use 
    operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, 
    activities and membership services we bring to you and we request that our 
    operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your 
    Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to third party marketers 
    that are not associated with the Station or website. Additionally, such providers 
    are not to use your personal Information for their own marketing or promotional 
    purposes. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">In the event that the assets or stock of the Station, its 
    corporate licensee or parent company(s) are sold or transferred, merged with 
    a different company or entity, restructured, or subject to other fundamental 
    corporate changes, we reserve the right to disclose any and all databases 
    compiled from Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected 
    by the Station to such successor. We will seek to obligate the Station’s 
    successor to agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy, as it may hereafter 
    be modified, but cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so or that the 
    successor company will comply with this obligation. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">We reserve the right to collect Personal Information using 
    any new technology yet to be developed and to use such technology to provide 
    new services and features to you, as well as for marketing and promotional 
    purposes. Specific information regarding your choice to Opt-in or to Opt-out 
    to such use, or for sharing your Personal Information with Advertisers, will 
    be provided once the new technology, service, or feature is introduced. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WEBSITE COLLECTION, USE, 
  AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION <a name="website" id="website"></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally, you may browse 
  this Site without providing any Personal Information. For certain activities 
  (such as contest and sweepstakes registrations, membership, awards points and 
  loyal listener clubs, music sampling and surveys, news/sports/weather alerts, 
  nominations for civic or Best Teacher/Coach awards, or registration for chat 
  rooms and message boards) the Personal Information you voluntarily provide may 
  include your first/middle and last name, home address, business address, email 
  address, telephone number, mobile phone/text messaging device number, birth 
  date, gender, employer or personal preferences, depending on the activity. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unless stated otherwise, 
  we do not request contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or 
  any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “.net” 
  or “.com”) as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits 
  the sending of commercial email messages directly to a wireless device that 
  uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent. We 
  may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name 
  when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club. However, 
  we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial email. 
  We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless 
  device that uses a domain name as such messages are not deemed to be commercial 
  email and therefore, are not regulated by Federal law. However, when “computer 
  to phone” commercial emails are prohibited by law, we may reject your 
  wireless device contact information when such information is submitted for certain 
  Site features or services. We will attempt to notify you if we will need new 
  contact information.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For specific purposes (such 
  as the purchase of goods and services) we may request a type of confidential 
  personally identifiable information which shall be called “Sensitive Personal 
  Information” and is defined as any individual’s: (1) social security 
  number; (2) driver’s license number or state identification card number; 
  or (3) account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any 
  required security code, access code or password that would permit access to 
  an individual’s financial account. This Sensitive Personal Information 
  will only be used to implement the specific activity or event it was submitted 
  for. We will not share your Sensitive Personal Information with Advertisers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, more general Personal 
  Information will be used to implement the specific activity or event and will 
  also be used for the marketing of additional events, services and merchandising 
  for this Site and the Station. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DISCLOSURE TO ADVERTISERS 
  <a name="disclosure" id="disclosure"></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Advertising support allows 
  us to offer, free of charge, many great activities and services to our users 
  such as contests, sweepstakes and special events. Therefore, we may also use 
  your Personal Information for the marketing of events, products or services 
  of our generous Advertisers. There are two ways users may receive such information 
  from Advertisers, either indirectly via newsletters, email or direct mail from 
  the Site, or directly from the Advertiser. We may use one or both methods depending 
  on the activity and the Advertiser. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We do not currently share 
  Personal Information with our Advertisers. However, depending on the activity, 
  we may in the future do so and you will receive notice on the Site and/or in 
  the rules of participation (“Rules of Participation”) for the event 
  or activity, or via an email notice. Please be informed that our Advertisers 
  may not have the same privacy policies that we do. Therefore, you will need 
  to tell us if you do not want to receive marketing information directly from 
  our Advertisers. You will need to check the “Opt-out” click boxes 
  that may be included on the registration area for the particular event, in an 
  email, or alternatively, notify the Site’s Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy@kroq.com">privacy@kroq.com</a>. 
  You will also need to tell us if you do not wish to receive marketing or promotional 
  materials from the Site and/or Station in the same manner.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also provide you with 
  an option to “Opt-out” of receiving advertising and promotional 
  email from us in compliance with federal law by installing an Opt-out mechanism 
  with all such email messages. You must use the designated method in the email 
  message to notify us of your Opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other 
  methods of notification will be effective or timely. Please be aware that we 
  may continue to contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, 
  including follow-up messages regarding contests you have entered or other transactions 
  you have undertaken. By law, such messages are not considered to be commercial 
  email.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are not responsible for 
  removing your Personal Information from third party lists or entities which 
  you have previously authorized us to share your information. You will need to 
  contact those entities directly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cookies and Image Tags<a name="cookies"></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of cookies is an 
  industry standard and they are currently used on most websites, including this 
  Site. Cookies are a small text file containing a unique identification number 
  that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of a user’s computer 
  so that the website administrator or a third party operational service provider 
  may identify the computer and passively track the user’s activities on 
  the website. Image tags work in conjunction with cookies and are small image 
  files that may be located on select pages of our Site, or with-in web-based 
  email newsletters that we may send. (Image tags are also called web beacons, 
  web bugs, clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs.) Tracking is important because we 
  can better understand what parts of our website are used the most, when to launch 
  new services and how to enhance current offerings. We may share the information 
  we receive from cookies and image tags with third-parties and our Advertisers 
  in aggregate form, which means that such information does not contain specific 
  Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information about any one visitor.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In short, cookies and image 
  tags collect a user’s Internet protocols and server information. Such 
  data files allow our Site to remember your web browser when you visit our Site 
  and are necessary tools for quick and efficient access to membership clubs, 
  awards programs and contests. A cookie will not allow the Site to learn any 
  Personal Information (such as your real name and email address) or Sensitive 
  Personal Information that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies and image 
  tags allow the Site to remember important information that will make the Site 
  easier for you to use and helpful in our administration of various activities. 
  We do not use cookies or image tags to collect other Personal Information or 
  Sensitive Personal Information unless you give us permission to do so.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can choose to have your 
  computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent, or you can 
  choose to turn off all such devices. This is done through your browser. If you 
  turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features at our Site that 
  make your Internet experience more efficient and enjoyable – like the 
  features mentioned above – and some of our other services will not function 
  properly. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children's Privacy Policy<a name="children"></a> 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although persons of all 
  ages may visit our Site and participate in activities that do not require the 
  collection of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, we do 
  not knowingly or intentionally collect Personal Information or Sensitive Personal 
  Information from children under the age of 13. Except for the limited circumstances 
  listed below, we will automatically reject and delete the registration or entry 
  of any person we believe in good faith to be underage. Any false or fraudulent 
  registration or entry from a minor will be deemed to be ineligible and will 
  disqualify the minor from the receipt of a prize, benefit, or other participation. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Except to meet Federal Communications 
  Commission (“FCC”), or other regulatory and legal purposes, we will 
  not use, store, or disclose any child’s Personal Information to a third 
  party without prior parental consent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Email Policy<a name="email"></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not generally keep 
  email correspondence, except for those emails that relate to the on-air programs 
  or operations of KROQ. As required by the FCC, if any part of your email correspondence 
  relates to Station programming or operations, we must place such correspondence 
  in the Station’s FCC Public Inspection File, or make the correspondence 
  available via electronic file access at the Station to anyone that requests 
  such information. Therefore, be informed that your Personal Information or Sensitive 
  Personal Information contained in certain emails, including Personal Information 
  knowingly received from a child under the age of thirteen, will be disclosed 
  to the general public. (Please see our <a href="#children">Children’s 
  Privacy Policy</a> section for details.) We request that you not place any Sensitive 
  Personal Information in your email correspondence to the Station that pertains 
  to station programming or operations. You understand and agree that we are not 
  responsible for Sensitive Personal Information that is improperly disclosed 
  in emails that are made available to the general public in compliance with FCC

  Shopping &amp; E-Commerce <a name="ecom"></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If this Site sells goods 
  and/or services or provides auction services we will request Sensitive Personal 
  Information that includes your credit card, debit card or other payment information. 
  Alternatively, the Site may use a third party operational service provider to 
  conduct the financial transaction in a secured manner; the third party payment 
  will be accessible via a hyperlink from the Site and will be solely responsible 
  for all financial transactions and the collection, use, and storage of your 
  Personal Information. The Site may request additional Personal Information such 
  as full name, billing and shipping address, email address and telephone number 
  and any such information that is required to fulfill your order and to communicate 
  with you regarding your order. Sensitive Personal Information will be encrypted 
  or collected though a secured Internet connection generally via SSL or S-HTTP 
  protocols. Such Sensitive Personal Information will also be stored in a commercially 
  reasonable secure manner. We may use your Personal Information, (but not your 
  credit card or debit card number) to contact you about future products, services 
  and discounts from the Station or to provide such information indirectly from 
  our Advertisers, unless you tell us otherwise (“Opt-out”). We will 
  only use your credit card and debit card number to complete the specific transaction 
  you requested.<br>

  Content on the Site<a name="ads"></a><br>
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy does not cover third party advertising or third party content 
  that may be present on the Site. This Site may provide banner and general advertising, 
  in addition to other content provided by our Advertisers or operational service 
  providers. Users may from time to time purchase goods or services offered through, 
  or otherwise participate in or send messages concerning such advertising, promotions 
  or third party content offered through the Site. Such correspondence, transactions 
  and agreements are solely between the user and the Advertiser or the third party 
  content provider and do not involve the Site. Also, Advertisers and such third 
  party content providers may not have the same privacy policies that we do and 
  you are encouraged to read their privacy policy first. <br>

  Hyper Links to Other Websites<a name="hyper"></a><br>
  <br>
  This Site often provides links to third party websites that could be of interest 
  to our users, including the websites of our Advertisers. As stated in our Terms 
  of Use Agreement, the Station does not own or control these websites and therefore, 
  is not responsible for the content, business practices, nor operations of such 
  websites. Third party websites linked on this Site may have different privacy 
  policies and business practices than we do. The presence of a link to a third 
  party website does not constitute or imply our endorsement, recommendation, 
  or sponsorship of the third party content, goods, or services available through, 
  or contained on, the Site. By use of this Site, you have agreed that you will 
  use the hyperlinks to third party sites at your own risk. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OFF-LINE COLLECTION, USE, 
  AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION <a name="offline" id="offline"></a><br>
  The Station also collects and uses Personal Information by other means, via 
  on-air broadcasts, telephone, direct mail, and direct from members of the public. 
  The various uses of such Personal Information include, but are not limited to, 
  contests &amp; sweepstakes, loyal listener club registration, other special 
  membership only features/events, news-tip lines, job applications, listener 
  complaints, and operational and business purposes.<br>
  Except for contests &amp; sweepstakes entries, or registrations for a loyal 
  listener or other special membership features/events, we do not ordinarily use 
  your Personal Information collected off-line for promotional or advertising 
  purposes, nor do we share it with third parties for promotional or marketing 
  purposes. If Personal Information collected off-line will be used by the Station, 
  its parent company(s), or corporate affiliates for promotional and marketing 
  purposes, you will have the opportunity to Opt-out of such use. If such information 
  will be shared with Advertisers, you will have the same rights as provided for 
  the disclosure of Personal Information collected online. (Please see the “Website 
  Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Personal Information” section.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Security Measures<a name="security"></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We conduct the collection, 
  management, maintenance and storage of listener or website user information 
  in a secure and commercially reasonable manner using acceptable industry standards 
  of security technology and practices (such as electronic security systems and 
  password protections) to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of Personal 
  Information. We also request that our operational service providers take such 
  precautions. WWW.KROQ.COM databases are accessible only by authorized personnel. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, please note that 
  when users transmit Personal Information over an unsecured Internet connection, 
  the Site is not responsible for the security of that information during the 
  transmission stage as your email or registration could be copied or intercepted 
  by unknown third parties. We use a secured connection only for the collection 
  of Sensitive Personal Information, which is necessary for the purchase of goods 
  or services, but we do not use a secured connection for other types of activities. 
  Therefore, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that you transmit certain 
  Personal Information over this Site at your own risk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REVIEW, UPDATE, CORRECT, 
  OR DELETE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION<a name="review"></a> 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally, you may review, 
  update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information 
  collected by the Site. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. Certain types 
  of Personal Information that are necessary to check eligibility, such as birth 
  date or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification 
  of the new information. Note that we reserve the right to terminate or delete 
  any membership or entry if we believe the Personal Information submitted was 
  knowingly false or fraudulent.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To review, update or delete 
  your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the 
  Site, please email the Site’s Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy@kroq.com">privacy@kroq.com</a> 
  or <a href="mailto:privacy@kroq.com">click here</a>. To have access to your 
  Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you must provide proof 
  of identification such as full name, street address, city/state and zip code, 
  user ID and password, and/or information about your recent activity on the website. 
  We reserve the right to deny access to any user if we believe there is a question 
  about your identity. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your 
  Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if 
  the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide 
  access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation 
  of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.
