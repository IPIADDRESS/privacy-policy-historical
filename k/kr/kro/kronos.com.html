<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>
Kronos<span class="marks">®</span> Incorporated respects your right to privacy. This statement discloses the privacy practices for the Kronos Incorporated website. This statement also describes other important topics relating to your privacy. Click here for <a href="#TM">information regarding additional product-specific privacy practices which Kronos employs for Kronos Workforce Acquisition™ products</a>.</p>

<h2>Personal information</h2>
<p>
At Kronos Incorporated, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit Kronos Incorporated on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may request information from you, such as your name, address, title, company name, telephone number, or email address, that you voluntarily provide. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet. If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet — to correspond with you, process a request for return contact, or to provide you with further information, for example — it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it.</p>

<h2>Information security and quality</h2>
<p>
We intend to protect the integrity of your personally identifiable information. We have implemented appropriate technical and managerial procedures to maintain information that is accurate, current, and complete. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. We will make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to correct personal information inaccuracies in a timely manner. You always have the right to access the information we have about you.</p>
<p>
Some of our Web pages may contain "cookies," which are data that may be sent to your web browser and stored on your computer. This allows our server to recognize you when you visit our Web site in the future and allows Kronos Incorporated the capability to improve our website and better meet your needs. Most web browsers can be configured to not accept cookies, or to notify you if a cookie is sent to you.</p>

<h2>Business relationships</h2>
<p>
The Kronos Incorporated site may contain links to other websites, including those of our business partners. Kronos Incorporated is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.</p>

<h2>Email</h2>
<p>
If Kronos Incorporated sends you an email for which you have opted-in by voluntarily providing Kronos Incorporated with personally identifiable information, there will be a link on the page that allows you to "unsubscribe" to any additional emails by typing in the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line and replying. Kronos Incorporated will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally suppress you from our database.</p>

<h2>Retention of information</h2>
<p>
If you have submitted personal information to Kronos Incorporated electronically and would like it removed or modified, please contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:Kronos_Incorporated@kronos.com">Kronos_Incorporated@kronos.com</a>.

<h1>Privacy Statement for Kronos Talent Management Division</h1>
<h2 class="deck">Workforce Acquisition products</h2>

<h3>Purpose of this policy</h3>
<p>
The following sets out the privacy policies and practices of the Kronos Talent Management Division (Kronos TM) with respect to Workforce Acquisition products and the collection, use, and disclosure of "personally identifiable information", which in this policy means any information about an identifiable individual. Your continued use of the Kronos TM sites constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices provided in this policy and your consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of personal information in accordance with this policy.</p>


<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
Kronos TM takes reasonable precautions to protect individuals' personal information collected or maintained by Kronos TM against loss, unauthorized access, and illegal use or disclosure. Kronos TM protects the security of personal information during transmission via the Internet by using industry-standard cryptographic technology such as Secure Sockets Layer. Personal information is stored in secure locations. Kronos TM staff is trained on procedures for the release of personal information and such information is not shared with unaffiliated third parties. Kronos TM conducts periodic audits to ensure that proper information management policies and procedures are being followed.</p>


<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>
If you apply for employment at one of our customers through a Kronos TM hosted web site, personal information about you will be collected by the employer, at which you are applying for employment, and Kronos TM for use in connection with the application process. This information may include but will not be limited to your name, physical and e-mail address, other contact information, social security number (social insurance number is not collected in Canada), prior work history, and other background information. This information will be used by the employer and Kronos TM for purposes such as assessing your suitability for employment with the employer and its branches or affiliates, conducting background investigations, verifying information about you, conducting applicant and employment-related statistical evaluation and record keeping, to comply with legal obligations or as reasonably necessary or advisable to defend or enforce the legal rights or business interests of Kronos TM, its users, customers or affiliates, or for such other purposes as are identified at or before the time of collection of the information or to which you consent from time to time. In the course of the application process, this information may also be disclosed to others such as companies engaged to perform background investigations or to verify the accuracy of the information contained in your application, to government agencies evaluating the application process, to third party vendors who assist the employer in performing its business functions. This information is also subject to disclosure as may be required by law.  Kronos TM may also disclose personal information to insurers or to legal, financial, and other professional advisors or in connection with a reorganization, sale, merger, change in control, transfer of assets, or other business transaction.</p>


<h3>Business transitions</h3>
<p>
In the event Kronos TM goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Kronos TM will provide its collected data to law enforcement agencies if legally required to do so pursuant to law, court order or other governmental action.</p>


<h3>Employer's desktop site (employer.unicru.com)</h3>
<p>
Employer's Desktop is a private, password-protected web-based application used by our clients to manage the hiring process. During the course of normal business processes, customers utilizing our "Employer's Desktop" product may need to enter additional information about job applicants or employees hired using Kronos TM's Hiring Management System. That data is stored securely in Kronos TM's data warehouse and is made available only to authorized personnel within the organization providing it. Applicant or employer data may be transmitted, via Employer's Desktop, to different locations or branches within the same company. This allows job applications to be available to multiple locations of the same company when appropriate.
Applicant data may be viewed by authorized Kronos TM staff in order to support the application and administrative needs of job seekers and our customers. For instance, if there is a problem or error in a job application, members of Kronos TM's development team or client services department may review applications to assist in resolving the issue.</p>


<h3>Maintenance of restart codes and passwords</h3>
<p>
For web applications where you create a restart code and password, it is solely your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password. You are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. Kronos TM will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else having used your password, either with or without your knowledge. You could be held liable for losses incurred by Kronos TM or another party due to someone else having used your password. You may not use anyone else's password at any time. Kronos TM is not responsible for data which is lost or altered or for any data which you enter and submit to employers. Kronos TM is not responsible in the event a candidate is not hired for a job.</p>


<h3>Special notice to Canada applicants</h3>
<p>
The information collected through this web site may be stored and accessed outside Canada (including in the United States). Please note that social insurance numbers will not be collected during the application process for applicants applying in Canada.</p>
