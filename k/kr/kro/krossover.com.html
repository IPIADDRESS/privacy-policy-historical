<h5 class="sub-title">Cookies</h5>
<p>We use "cookies" to customize your experience on the Website and, if you create a password, to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website. "Cookies" are small computer files that are transferred to your computer's hard drive that contain information such as your user ID, user preferences, the pages you've visited and the activities you've performed while using the Website. We do not link the information stored in cookies to any of your Personal Information you submit while on the Website. You may block cookies or delete cookies from your hard drive; however, by disabling cookies, you may not have access to all of the features of the Website. Some of our business partners also use cookies to provide us with anonymous data and information regarding your use of the Website. We do not have access or control over these cookies, our privacy policy does not cover the use of third party cookies.</p>

<h5 class="sub-title">Web Beacons</h5>
<p>We or our third party tracking utility company also use "web beacons" to collect anonymous information about your use of our Website and the websites of selected sponsors and advertisers, and your use of emails, special promotions or newsletters we send to you. Web beacons are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or email and send back to its home server information from the user's browser. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our Website and selected sponsors' and advertisers' sites and opening our emails, and for what purposes. Our web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of our Website. We do not link Non-Personal Information from web beacons to Personal Information without your permission.</p>
