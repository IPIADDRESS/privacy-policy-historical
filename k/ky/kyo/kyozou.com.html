        <p>Kyozou Inc. (<strong>Kyozou</strong>) respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.</p>

		<h2 class="no-margin">COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</h2>
		<p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.

		<h2 class="no-margin">INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h2>
