							<p>Kiplinger.com respects your privacy. We do not share your e-mail address with anyone or any company. Following are the specifics of how we protect your privacy.</p>

<p><b>WHEN YOU VISIT KIPLINGER.COM.</b> Our server automatically recognizes the domain name of visitors. We collect domain names only to keep statistics on which of our Webpages are being accessed and how often. We share them with no one.</p>

<p><b>WHEN YOU FILL OUT A FORM ON KIPLINGER.COM.</b>  When information is provided via feedback forms, we capture all of the information you provide, including your e-mail address and the type of browser being used. However, this information is not compiled or used for any purpose other than to communicate with you.</p>

<p><b>WHEN YOU PARTICIPATE IN AN ONLINE SURVEY.</b> We may share survey information about our users with advertisers and business partners. However, we keep and share only aggregate numbers. For example, we will say x percent of our users are females and y percent males.  We do not reveal any individual information about you.</p>

<p><b>WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR E-MAIL UPDATES AND COLUMNS.</b> Kiplinger promotions, as well as outside advertising, may appear on e-mail updates and columns.  Your e-mail address will not be shared with other companies or organizations. You can remove your name from the e-mail subscription list at any time by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each of our e-mails.</p>

<p><b>OUR POLICY ON “COOKIES.”</b> From time to time, Kiplinger.com may place a "cookie" in a file on your computer. The cookie itself does not collect or reveal any personally identifying information about you. The company that serves ads on our Website uses cookies for various tracking purposes. You always have the option of disabling cookies via your browser preferences. </p>

<p><b>WHEN YOU CLICK ON A LINK TO ANOTHER WEB SITE.</b> This Web site contains links to other sites, including advertiser sites, and content partners. These sites are not under our control and so are not covered by our Privacy Policy statement. </p>

<p>This site uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, the third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and choices you have to prevent having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/" class="bodytext">click here</a>.</p>

<p><b>WHEN YOU PARTICIPATE IN A FORUM.</b> You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) in the forums or during a chat, that information can be collected and used by others not connected with Kiplinger, and may result in unsolicited messages from them. </p>

<p><b>IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO A KIPLINGER PUBLICATION.</b> Kiplinger never sells e-mail addresses, but if you supply us with your postal address when signing up for any of Kiplinger's print publications, you should be aware that from time to time we do make our subscriber list available to carefully screened companies for use in direct mail solicitations. If you are a print subscriber and would rather not receive such solicitations, send your mailing label to P.O. Box 3292, Harlan, IA 51593-0472, and instruct Kiplinger to exclude your name.</p>
