              Fund</p>
            <p class="main">Protecting your personal privacy is very important to us. We hope
              the following statement will help you understand how the American
              Kidney Fund collects, uses and safeguards the personal information
              you might provide to us. Specifics about what information is collected
              and how it is used follows this Privacy Policy Statement.</p>
            <p class="main"> Your personal privacy is a principal concern for us. Our goal
              in outlining our policy on the collection and use of user data
              is to ensure the highest level of confidentiality and security.
              When you provide any personal information to the Fund, we will
              not give or sell your personal information to any outside company
              for its use in marketing or solicitation. We will maintain the
              confidentiality of your personal information and it will be used
              only to support your relationship with us, assisting us in providing
              better services for you. Additionally, internal practices are in
              place to help protect your privacy by limiting employee access
              to and use of this data. When browsing our site, we allow our users
              to maintain control over their personal data while attempting to
              provide a more interactive online experience. If you provide a
              mailing address or e-mail address, our intention is to send correspondence
              only to those who have chosen to receive such communications. At
              any time, you have the right to decline receiving future communications
              in any manner, including e-mail, fax, and postal mail.</p>

              <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">Information collection.</span> When you <strong><em>browse</em></strong> the American Kidney Fund site, you do so anonymously. 
			  		Personal information— including your e-mail address—is <em>not</em> collected. However, we may 
					request that you <em><strong>voluntarily</strong></em> supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address for purposes 
					such as correspondence, site registration, membership, making a purchase or donation, or participating in 
					online surveys. We may ask for your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mailing address and other optional 
					information that we deem necessary to fulfill any requests you may have. At any time, you may decline to 
					provide such information and we will do our best to fulfill any requests you may have with the information you 
					desire to share with us.<br>
                <br>
                	Like many other web sites, the American Kidney Fund may use a standard technology called a "cookie" 
					to collect information about how our site is used. Please read <a href="cookies.asp">
					About Cookies</a> for more information. We collect only information that is needed, and we tell you how we use 
					it. We limit the collection of information about our site users to what we need to know to manage their 
					relationship with the Fund, to provide customer service, to offer new products and services, and to fulfill any

				<br>
              <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">We ensure information

				<br>
              <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">We restrict the release

					court order or subpoena would require us to release information, we notify the user directly so that his/her 
					legal rights can be exercised, if appropriate. The only exceptions to this policy are when we are prohibited by 
					court order or law from notifying the user, or cases in which fraud and/or criminal activity is suspected.<br>
