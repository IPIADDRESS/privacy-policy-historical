      <p class="purpleHeadingStyle">What sort of information is collected by this

      <p></p>
      <p><span class="blackSmallHeadingStyle">This site is home to a multitude of activities, games
        and services for both parents and children. </span><br>
        Only children accompanied
        by an adult can access UpToTen Kids. We ask the parent or guardian to
        identify themselves and to open a free UpToTen User Account before we
        allow access to the child. Some of the data collected is personally identifiable information (first and last names, professional or home address, email address...), and some is not ( gender, age, browser used on the PC...)</p>
      <p>We collect personally identifiable information concerning the parent 
        or guardian during the sign-up process. For the Boowa and Kwala club, 
        we require personally identifiable information about the child. The inscription 
        for the Club can only be completed via a valid UpToTen User Account. The 
        data we collect concerning children under the age of 13 is therefore provided 
        by their parent or guardian (in compliance with <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html" target="_blank">COPPA</a> 
        (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and all European legislation 
        currently in force).</p>
      <p>The following text aims to clearly state UpToTen's policy
        concerning personal data collected on the site. We will explain how the
        information is collected and for what reasons. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>UpToTen does not sell, exchange or broadcast publicly information provided 
        by users without their consent and this in strict accordance with the 
        relevant applicable laws (the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html" target="_blank">COPPA</a>, 
        for example). UpToTen respects the concerns and private lives of its visitors 
        and their families. All information given remains the sole property of 
        UpToTen. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>UpToTen will partner with commercial institutions in
        order to offer club members and UpToTen User Account holders quality products
        and services. Unless otherwise stated, adhesion to UpToTen via a Boowa
        &amp; Kwala Club membership or an UpToTen User Account gives the adherent
        access to direct promotion for UpToTen products and those of carefully
        chosen partners. </p>
      <p>Our partners' products will be recommended by Boowa and
        Kwala and will therefore be quality, well-known brands that are suitable
        for Boowa and Kwala fans. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>UpToTen makes every effort to ensure that it complies
        with all relevant laws and regulations and will make prior inquiries with
        conversant authorities. </p>

      <p>Use of UpToTen e-commerce applications are subject to the
        policies and terms and conditions covering the sites, including those
        with respect to collection of personal information necessary to process
        any orders. The policies and terms of use covering these can be accessed
        from the pages of our sites and from within these applications themselves.
        These applications are intended for adults and a credit card is required
        in order to complete the ordering process. We have developed our own applications
        and house them on our secure server. </p>
      <p>All credit card information is collected directly by our bank
        on their own secure servers. This ensures maximum security and peace of
        mind for our users. </p>
      <p> All the information sent and received at the time of payment are encrypted
        using 128 bit encryption technology (the strongest commercially available
        today). The encryption keys are provided by Verisign(<a href="http://www.verisign.com" target="_blank">http://www.verisign.com</a>),
        the world leader in this field.</p><p>In
        the future we may call upon outside contractors to process and fulfill
        orders made from the UpToTen Store. In this case, UpToTen will choose
        only trusted, reliable partners with a household name. They will then
        be responsible for adhering to our own privacy and security policies.

      <p class="purpleHeadingStyle">General Conditions that apply to our privacy
      policy</p>
      <p>Although UpToTen follows and complies with the Children's
        Online Privacy Protection Act, the regulations promulgated thereunder
        and the currently applicable European laws concerning children on the
        Internet, this does not guarantee safety or that the relevant person is
        a child or a parent or legal guardian, and UpToTen does not guarantee
        the actual identities claimed by its users. Also, we do not guarantee
        that your children will not voluntarily release personal information about
        themselves or about you or their friends or other acquaintances on our
        site or on sites that they visit or link to from our site. It is very
        important that parents understand the features, uses and potential risks
        of using UpToTen.com. That's why we advise all users to practice safe
        computing and urge parents to advise their children not to give out any
      personally identifiable information without their consent. </p>
      <p>UpToTen is not immune from the possibility of acts of piracy. UpToTen can therefore not be held responsible for any pirated content within its pages. We guarantee, however, that we employ the strictest controls and security measure to ensure that acts of piracy do not occur.</p>
      <p>UpToTen makes no guarantees, warranties or representations
        that you or your child will be absolutely safe or insulated from inappropriate
        content or behavior and we do not guarantee, warrant or represent that
        a child will not try to circumvent, or be successful in circumventing,
        the features on our site. Furthermore, UpToTen does not assume any obligations,
        liability, or responsibilities associated with such behavior or associated
      with the obligations of parental supervision.</p>
      <p>UpToTen reserves the right to change the information,
        features, products, policies, promotions, disclosures and disclaimers
        at any time. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the UpToTen
        site. Please check these terms periodically for changes. At the top of
        the policy we indicate the date of the last update. The continued use
        of the UpToTen web site following the posting of changes to these terms
        will mean you accept such changes, and any off-line consent provided under
        COPPA will be deemed to apply to the revised policies and new or modified
        features. However, in the event there is a material change in our data
      collection, use or disclosure practices, we will obtain a new consent.</p>
      <p>These contractual conditions shall be analyzed and governed by the laws of MAURITIUS without regard to its conflict of law provisions. If any of the terms of these conditions are found to be illegal, invalid or void for any reason it shall be considered severable and shall not affect the validity or application of the other provisions.</p>
      <p>Thank you for being concerned with kids' privacy and safety issues and
        for taking the time to read this Privacy Policy. We hope that you and
        your children enjoy UpToTen.com. If you have any questions or comments,
      please feel free to contact us. </p>
      <p>We hope that we have made the functioning of this site sufficiently clear
