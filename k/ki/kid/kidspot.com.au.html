<a name="1"></a><h2>What kind of information does Kidspot collect?</h2>

<p>Kidspot collects information on our site visitors collectively including which sections of the site are most frequently visited, how often and for how long. This data is always used as aggregated, non-personal information. Kidspot utilises this information to improve and enhance our services by monitoring the areas on the site which are most popular to you. This aggregated information may be shared with Kidspot partners to provide them with an overview of how Kidspot visitors use the site. This is done for the purposes of providing you with the best destination for all things kids.</p>

<p>For Kidspot advertisers, we collect information, such as name, e-mail address, phone and credit card numbers from you if you purchase advertising on our website. We maintain a record of your product interests and the purchases you make online or by phone.  If you just visit Kidspot to search, we do not automatically collect any information.  The only information we may collect is your email address if you choose to sign up for our newsletter.<a href="#">top</a></p>
 
<a name="2"></a><h2>How does Kidspot use my information?</h2>
<p>When you place an order or make a purchase from Kidspot, we use your personal information to process your order, send you e-mails to confirm your order or to contact you via phone or e-mail if we have other questions regarding your advertising order or purchase. </p>

<p>When you place an advertisement or save your information online, we will use your e-mail address to send you information about our products, services, and promotions and to help us learn more about your advertising preferences. You always have the choice not to receive marketing information or calls. </p>

<p>We may also contact you, subject to the choices you have made, via e-mail, or telephone, to conduct market research and learn more about how we can improve our product offerings.<a href="#">top</a></p>

<a name="3"></a><h2>How is my information stored?</h2>
<p>Kidspot takes all reasonable steps to ensure the security of our system. Kidspot allows you to access your information at any time to keep it accurate and up to date. Any information which we hold for you is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities.</p>

<p>In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by Kidspot. However, Kidspot will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access of your personal information. </p>

<p>You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used on the Kidspot site for the purpose of advertising. Please notify us immediately at info@kidspot.com.au  if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.<a href="#">top</a></p>

<a name="4"></a><h2>Does Kidspot share my information with third parties?</h2>
<p>No, we do not share personal information with 3rd parties.  However, information about site usage, category performance and other key metrics may be used collectively in sales collateral and other public forums.<a href="#">top</a></p>

<a name="5"></a><h2>How do I access my information? How do I change or delete my information?</h2>
<p>You can review, change or delete certain personal information related to your use of our site (e.g., name and contact information). For advertisers, simply click "My Account" after logging in to the Advertiser Directory and you'll be able to edit your personal information. You can also ask us to update your personal information, by calling us at 1 300 724 575 or you may click here to e-mail Kidspot customer service. Please be sure to include your e-mail address, full name and password. Please note that any requests to update your personal information may take up to two business days for your e-mail request. 
To unsubscribe to our monthly newsletter, simply follow the instructions at the bottom of the newsletter.<a href="#">top</a></p>

<a name="6"></a><h2>How does Kidspot protect kids' privacy?</h2>
<p>Kidspot is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet and will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. <a href="#">top</a></p>

<a name="7"></a><h2>What are cookies? How does Kidspot use cookies on its site?</h2>
<p>A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie. </p>

<p>We use cookies in order to improve your search and advertising experience. Cookies enable us to keep track of your search preferences and advertising selections as you use our site. </p>

<p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order to enable you to purchase advertising from our site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered advertiser, which allows you to access your account information. <a href="#">top</a></p>

<a name="8"></a><h2>Is my information secure?</h2>

<p>Protecting your advertising order information is important to us. Kidspot uses SecurePay's Internet Payment Gateway to provide a secure environment for the authorisation of credit card transactions over the Internet. Confidential information including client credit card details are encrypted the moment they are transmitted from the client's browser to the banking network using industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology )128-bit RC4 encryption technology.</p>

<p>A client's credit card details are not stored anywhere on the Internet and the only company who has access to this data is the merchant's bank. The bank also sends confirmation information via the same encryption technology back to the client's browser. These secure processes provide clients with peace of mind when purchasing online.</p>

<p>Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at Kidspot. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."</p>

<p>If your browser or firewall doesn't support SSL, you will not be able to connect to the server, which means you won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please place your order by phone at 1-300-724-575.<a href="#">top</a></p>

<a name="9"></a><h2>What about links to other websites and services?</h2>
<p>The Kidspot website and its advertisements may contain links to other sites. Kidspot does not control the privacy policies or practices of these websites. You should review those policies before providing any personal information. Kidspot is not responsible for the content or practices of any linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.<a href="#">top</a></p>
