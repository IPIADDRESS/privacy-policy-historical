    <b>Terms and Conditions / Privacy Policy </b>
    <p>Search results provided by Google SafeSearch with additional keyword 
	filtering by KidzSearch.com. KidzSearch offers no guarantees or warranties on results. 
	Please <a href="contactus.html">contact us</a> if you have any specific 
	issues or concerns about results found.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>KidzSearch believes that maintaining the online privacy of children is 
    essential to building a safe site where kids can learn and play. We provide 
    the following information about our policies in conformance with the 1998 
    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).&nbsp; <b><br>
	<br>
	1. What personal information does KidzSearch collect?</b></p>
    <p>KidzSearch does not collect visitors' personally identifiable 
    information without consent, nor does KidzSearch require visitors to give personally 
    identifiable information in order to access or use our site. KidzSearch will 
    not require a visitor to disclose more information than is reasonably 
    necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of that 
    participation. The KidzSearch site contains links to other Web sites that 
    may ask for personal information. Although we try to review such sites 
    carefully, KidzSearch expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for 
    the privacy policies, data collection practices or regulatory compliance of 
    those independent sites. KidzSearch may have offers for a subscription 
    newsletter. Visitors must voluntarily enter their email in order to receive 
    our newsletter. We do not sell email names or provide access to 
    third-parties.&nbsp; Personal information, such as names, phone numbers, or 
    address details are never collected. We use a social booking service called 
	AddThis which allows users to bookmark and share pages. Keeping in 
	compliance with COPPA, we have specifically contacted AddThis and had them 
	disable any and all data collection features normally associated with their 
	product.</p>
    <p><b>2. Does KidzSearch use cookies?</b></p>
    <p>Yes, but only to provide site features, such as remembering a selected 
	background screen color when a person visits again. We do not store any 
	identifiable information. </p>
    <p><b>3. Does KidzSearch collect aggregated information?</b></p>
    <p>KidzSearch collects statistics on which keywords a visitor searches and 
    which responses they select. This information is gathered together 
    (aggregated) so that individual visitors cannot be identified or 
    distinguished from the whole. For example, we might know that 100 visitors 
    searched for giraffes, but we do not know who those visitors were. This 
    information helps us make editorial and design decisions to make KidzSearch 
    more helpful, such as providing better autocomplete. As required by COPPA, 
	we do not show any ads that are interest-based. We only allow ads that are 
	contextual, meaning it is related to the page a user is viewing and not 
	based on any identifiable information. This is done by opting-out of this 
	feature with our ad network partners. </p>
	<p>We may use aggregated information to help us target advertising or content 
	based on general location or other non-identifiable data. We also may collect IP Addresses (which domain a visitor is logged 
    on from), Referral Data (the address of the last URL a user visited prior to 
    clicking through to KidzSearch), Browser type (which browser is being used), 
    Platform Type (whether a visitor uses Macintosh or Windows), and Traffic 
    Flow (where a visitor spends their time while on the site) on our site, 
    however these collected pieces of information do not allow for personal 
    identification of the visitor.</p>
    <p><b>4. Does KidzSearch have a chat room?</b></p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p><b>5. Does KidzSearch run contests for children?</b></p>
    <p>We may have periodic contests.&nbsp; Collected information is never given 
	out to third-parties and parental permission is always required.<br>
	<br>
	<b>6. Interaction with Children<br>
	<br>
	</b>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information 
	gathering online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable 
	consent from a child's parent or guardian is required before collecting, 
	using, or disclosing personal information from a child under the age of 13.<br>
	<br>
	We collect no identifiable information about a child without parental 
	consent. None of our features require an account for usage. However, some 
	features have added value items, like notification if a homework help 
	question is answered. These special features require parental consent for 
	children under 13 before it can be used and we communicate this to the user. 
	If we do need to collect information about a child under 13 years of age, 
	COPPA required information and instructions will be provided by the specific 
	Web page that collects information about the child. The Web page will 
	specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will see it, and 
	how long it will be kept.<br>
	<br>
	There are several exceptions that permit collection of a child's email 
	address without receiving parental consent in advance:<br>
	<br>
	To provide the parents with notice and to seek consent for communications 
	with the child. Note: this may require collection of the parent's email 
	address as well.<br>
	<br>
	To respond to a one time request from a child, such as when they user our 
	contact form.<br>
	<br>
	To respond more than once to a child's request; i.e., subscription to a 
	newsletter. However, parental consent is required prior to the second 
	communication.<br>
	<br>
	To protect the safety of a child who is participating on the site; i.e., in 
	our homework help forum.<br>
	<br>
	To protect the site or to respond to law enforcement; i.e., in the case of a 
	Web site compromise.<br>
	<br>
	Personal information about children under 13 years of age may be needed to 
	respond to his/her communication to us, such as to request a site feature or 
	to report problems with the site. Personal information about your child will 
	be deleted/destroyed immediately upon completion of its intended purpose. On 
	rare occasions, it may be determined that a communication from a child under 
	13 years old should be maintained for historical purposes. Should such an 
	occasion occur, we will obtain the necessary consent from the child's 
	parent.<br>
