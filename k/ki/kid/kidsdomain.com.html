<p>
We at the Kid's Domain want everyone's visit here to be safe, both in
content and privacy issues.
</p><p>
<font size="+1" color="#003399" face="Comic Sans MS">
<b>Privacy:</b>
</font>
</p><p>
Any information collected on the web site for things such as
contests, voluntary mailing lists, or other projects will only be used for
the purpose stated (such as awarding a prize). We
will not send you unsolicited email, or share your information with any
other companies.
</p><p>
If there is a reason to post someone's information, we will post only
what is approved by that person, for instance, a prize winner might be
announced listing only their first name and state.
</p><p>
Specifically when it comes to children, we post reminders that they
should ask parental permission before giving out personal information
or downloading items to their computer.
</p><p>
<font size="+1" color="#003399" face="Comic Sans MS">
<b>Safety:</b>
</font>
</p><p>
The contents of the Kid's Domain are designed for family use. In
addition to our own content, we also provide links to software
publishers and sites with other related activities for children. We do
screen the other sites initally, but cannot be responsible for content
from other sites. If you or your child does come across something
inappropriate due to our links, please let us know and we will remove
it.
</p><p>
We also provide two pages of internet safety information - one geared
for <a href="../kids/surfsafe.html">kids with basic guidelines</a>, and the other for parents and
teachers, with links to a variety of <a href="../grown/nanny.html">safe surfing programs</a> that can
help prevent kids from surfing into inappropriate areas of the web.
</p><p>
<font size="+1" color="#003399" face="Comic Sans MS">

<b>For Parents:</b>
</font>
</p><p>
It is important for you to talk with your child about using the
internet safely.  Here are a few guidelines to start the discussion.
You might have your own to add:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Never give out your full name, address, or phone number without your
  parent's permission.
<p>
</p></li><li>If someone sends you something inappropriate, let your parents or
  teacher know.
<p>
</p></li><li>Never agree to meet someone you've been talking to on the net without
  your parent's permission.
<p>
</p></li><li>Treat others as you would like to be treated!
</li></ul>
<p>
Thanks, and we hope your visit to the Kid's Domain is fun!
