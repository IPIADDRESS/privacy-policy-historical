<font size="5"><b>KidsCom Privacy Policy</b></font>
<br><br>
For more than five years, KidsCom has been striving to create safe, educational and entertaining electronic playgrounds for kids 4 to 15. In that time, kids, parents and teachers from more than 120 countries around the world have joined us. Our mission is give kids a voice to the world and to each other around the world through a variety of engaging activities.
<br><br>
Anyone can play on KidsCom. It is free and registration is not required. Some areas of the site, however, are reserved for registered KidsCom Kids who have obtained their parent's permission.
<br><br>
KidsCom follows the FTC guidelines for compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and Rule. Verifiable parental permission is required prior to the collection of any personal information.
<br><br>
No personal information provided to KidsCom by its registered users is sold or rented to any third parties.
<br><br>

<b>Who needs to register?</b>
<br>
Registration is not required to play on and explore most of KidsCom. Registering as a KidsCom kid is only required for kids who want to chat on the Graffiti Wall, earn KidsKash Points for cool stuff in the Loot Locker, answer KidsKash Questions, join the Find a Key Pal program and be included in other special activities and promotions. KidsCom does not require, as a condition of participation, any KidsCom Kid to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary for them to participate in an activity.
<br><br>

<b>What info is collected?</b>
<br>
When a visitor to KidsCom wants to post something on the site (like on our monitored message boards or weekly creative writing challenges), we ask kids to provide info that is not personally identifiable (first name only, age and the country they live in). This information is included with their posted content and not used for any other purposes. All postings to KidsCom are screened by adult staff members before appearing on the site to help ensure children's online safety and privacy. Users are not allowed to post any personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
When a kid wants to become a registered KidsCom Kid, we ask their parents to provide the following information on the parent's permission form:
<ul>
<li> Child's first and last name
</li><li> Child's date of birth
</li><li> Child's e-mail address
</li><li> Parent's name
</li><li> Parent's e-mail address
</li></ul>
This information is requested regardless of the age of the child. 
<!--
<BR><BR>
The permission form&#150;&#150;signed by a parent or legal guardian&#150;&#150;must be faxed or mailed to KidsCom.-->
<br><br>
KidsCom uses this information to create and maintain separate registration records for each child. E-mail addresses are used to communicate with KidsCom Kids and their parents about activity on the site and other features. None of this information is sold or rented to any third parties.
<br><br>
We encourage parents to be involved with all of their child's online activities. 
<br><br>
After registering, we ask KidsCom Kids to provide some additional info to help us develop the most appropriate content for our site's visitors. We require them to tell us whether they are a boy or a girl and what country they live in. If they want, they can tell us what city and state (or province) they live in.
<br><br>
And registered KidsCom kids who have their parent's permission to be in the Find a Key Pal Program, also can share their favorite TV show and music group, their hobbies and what they want to be in the future. This information is shared only with other kids and during the search process of the Find a Key Pal program. Answering these questions is optional.
<br><br>
All information collected on KidsCom is done so directly from the parent or child.
<br><br>

<b>What areas on KidsCom require registration?</b>
<br><br>
<b>Graffiti Wall</b>––Kids can chat on the fully monitored KidsCom Graffiti Wall seven days a week, from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Central time. There is a chat room for kids 11 and younger, and one for kids 12 and older. All conversations are monitored as they happen by KidsCom's staff of trained adult chat monitors. Private messaging between kids is not allowed. And KidsCom Kids are not permitted to share any information that will personally identify them. If they do or ask another kid for that info, they will be kicked off the Graffiti Wall.
<br><br>
<b>Find a Key Pal Program</b>––This program, popular with classroom teachers, allows kids to find electronic pen pals from around the world. Only kids with a parent's permission can participate in the program. When kids search for a Key Pal, they'll be given the first name, hometown and country of their Key Pal, plus an e-mail address and other fun facts kids have provided (such as favorite TV show or music group, hobbies, etc.). Kids can have as many Key Pals as they want, but this information is given out just one child at a time to prevent anyone from getting a large number of names at once. This is the only area on KidsCom where a child's e-mail address is allowed to be shared. We strongly encourage parents to responsibly monitor their child's e-mail activities.
<br><br>
<b>KidsKash Points and the Loot Locker</b>––Registered kids can earn KidsKash Points by playing educational games of getting involved in other areas of the KidsCom site. These points can be redeemed in our Loot Locker, a collection of kids' merchandise and services contributed by a variety of companies (those companies have no access to registration information). Registration is required for earning KidsKash Points so we can accurately track each child's point totals.
<br><br>
<b>KidsKash Questions</b>––Registered KidsCom Kids can participate in occasional surveys in this area, which we use to gauge kids opinions on social, educational and marketing issues and topics. The responses from KidsKash Questions help guide our development of KidsCom and let us understand the topics that are on kids' minds. They also help other companies learn about kids. The results of all surveys we do always are reported in general, or aggregate, terms. We never break down the information to a point where individual children could be identified.

<b>Does KidsCom use cookies?</b>
<br><br>
<b>What is a cookie?</b>
<br>
A cookie is a small file that Web sites place on your computer to keep track of some information. On KidsCom, cookies do not store any personally identifiable information about you. You do not have to accept the cookies. In most cases, everything will work fine (just a little slower) if you do not accept the cookies. However, to earn KidsKash Points while playing some games on KidsCom you need to accept cookies.
<br><br>
<b>Where are cookies used on KidsCom?</b>
<br>
Cookies are used in two ways on KidsCom. KidsCom only uses cookies with registered users and does so only to improve the site functionality for registered users or where it is necessary to complete a particular activity.
<br><br>
First, cookies are used to keep log-in information in some areas so that registered users can access the site faster. These cookies contain a unique ID number so you can get into areas faster, instead of waiting for our computer to sort through all the different people in our records. These cookies do not track any of your other online activities and do not contain any personally identifiable information. These cookies expire after a certain amount of time and delete themselves from your computer.
<br><br>
Second, cookies are used during some games and activities on KidsCom. These are used only when registered users play games for KidsKash Points to keep track of your score. The cookie is created at the beginning of the game. When the game is over, the cookie deletes itself. These cookies do not store any personal information about you and do not track any of your other online activities.
<br><br>
Some of our advertisers may use cookies on our site. But KidsCom requires those partners to be in full compliance with federal guidelines for children's online safety and privacy. Those cookies cannot be used to collect any personal information from our users.
<br><br>
<b>How can parents update and delete info?</b>
<br>
KidsCom Kids and parents can view, correct, update and delete personal information provided in the registration process at any time. They will need the registered child's first name, last name, date of birth and password. Visit the KidsCom registration update page at <a href="/cgi-bin/registration/update.pl">http://www.kidscom.com/cgi-bin/registration/update.pl</a> for more information.
<br><br>

<b>Who can parents contact if they have more questions?</b>
<br>
If you have any additional questions or concerns about KidsCom, please contact the KidsCom staff. You can e-mail us at <a href="mailto:staff@kidscom.com">staff@kidscom.com</a> or call us at 414.271.5437.
