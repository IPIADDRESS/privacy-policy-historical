      <p>KidzBop.com is committed to providing a fun, safe and secure website for people of all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected online and to helping our visitors learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet. Because many visitors to this site are children, we take care that children access only the content that is appropriate for them. In addition, we employ special measures to help children protect their privacy while online. We do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity, and we take steps to prevent children from posting contact information. KidzBop.com is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. </p>
      <p>To help ensure a rewarding online experience for all visitors, we provide this summary of our information practices. This privacy notice governs the collection and use of information at KidzBop.com. </p>
      <p>As we continue to offer our visitors new and different types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to time. </p>

      <h2>What Information Is Collected?</h2>
      <p>At KidzBop.com, it's our policy to create website content that requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. From time to time, however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. a child's e-mail address and/or the e-mail address of a parent or third party), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other online activities. </p>

      <h2>Contests and Sweepstakes</h2>
      <p>KidzBop.com occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes, which may be entered online. To participate in a contest or sweepstakes, a child is asked to provide his or her first name and e-mail address. E-mail addresses are collected for the purpose of entering the online sweepstakes or contest on a one-time basis and are used to notify winners of the sweepstakes or contest. The parent or guardian of the winner will be required to return a completed prize acceptance form contained in the notification e-mail by facsimile or US mail within a designated time period. </p>

      <p>Sometimes, when we conduct contests or sweepstakes that may involve more than a one-time contact, we ask additionally for the e-mail address of the entrant's parent or guardian. In such types of contests or sweepstakes, we send the child's parent an e-mail informing him or her of the child's entry and give the parent the option to have the child's entry deleted. All the information collected by KidzBop.com is securely maintained and used only for the purpose of conducting the contest or sweepstakes. Once the contest or sweepstakes is finished, we then delete any personal information collected. The information collected in a KidzBop.com sweepstakes may be passed on to a fulfillment house which may use the information to help run the contest or sweepstakes and may not use it for other purposes. </p>

      <h2>E-mail</h2>
      <p>KidzBop.com may also provide the opportunity for visitors to send e-mail to us. All information collected is used only to respond to e-mail questions and/or requests. </p>


      <h2>Use of Information</h2>
      <p>KidzBop.com uses or may use personally identifiable information that children provide for such purposes as conducting contests or sweepstakes, and responding to their questions regarding our products and services. KidzBop.com currently does not disclose to third parties personally identifiable information that children provide, except from time to time, we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g. conducting contests and sweepstakes). Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all of the assets relating to KidzBop.com are transferred or sold to another entity, personally identifiable information submitted to us may be transferred to the acquiring entity. Finally, we may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in order to comply with law or requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property or safety of our website, users of our website and others. </p>
