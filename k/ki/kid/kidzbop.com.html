        is committed to providing a fun, safe and secure website for people of 
        all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected 
        online and to helping our visitors learn how to exercise control over 
        personal information while exploring the Internet. Because many visitors 
        to this site are children, we take care that children access only the 
        content that is appropriate for them. In addition, we employ special measures 
        to help children protect their privacy while online. We do not ask children 
        to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate 
        in a particular activity, and we take steps to prevent children from posting 
        contact information. KidzBop.com is committed to complying fully with 
        the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.</p>
      <p class="whiteText">To help ensure a rewarding online experience for all 
        visitors, we provide this summary of our information practices. This privacy 
        notice governs the collection and use of information at KidzBop.com.</p>
      <p class="whiteText">As we continue to offer our visitors new and different 
        types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to 
        time.</p>
      <p align="left" class="whiteText"><b class="yellowText">What Information 
        Is Collected?</b><br>
        At KidzBop.com, it's our policy to create website content that requires 
        minimum collection of information from our visitors. From time to time, 
        however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. 
        child's e-mail address and/or e-mail address of parent or third party), 
        as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes 
        or offer other online activities.</p>
      <p align="left" class="whiteText"><b class="yellowText">Contests and Sweepstakes</b><br>
        KidzBop.com occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes, which may be 
        entered online. To participate in a contest or sweepstakes, a child is 
        asked to provide his or her first name and e-mail address. E-mail addresses 
        are collected for the purpose of entering the online sweepstakes or contest 
        on a one-time basis and are used to notify winners of the sweepstakes 
        or contest. Winners will be required to return a completed prize acceptance 
        form contained in the notification e-mail by facsimile or US mail within 
        a designated time period (along with the signature of a parent or legal 
        guardian for all minors). </p>
      <p align="left" class="whiteText">Sometimes, when we conduct contests or 
        sweepstakes that may involve more than a one-time contact, we ask additionally 
        for the e-mail address of his or her parent. In such types of contests 
        or sweepstakes, we send the child's parent an e-mail informing him or 
        her of the child's entry and give the parent the option to have the child's 
        entry deleted. All the information collected by KidzBop.com is securely 
        maintained and used only for the purpose of conducting the contest or 
        sweepstakes. Once the contest or sweepstakes is finished, we then delete 
        any personal information collected. The information collected in a KidzBop.com 
        sweepstakes may be passed to a fulfillment house which may use the information 
        to help run the contest or sweepstakes and may not use it for other purposes 
        and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.</p>
      <p align="left" class="whiteText"><b class="yellowText">E-mail</b><br>
        KidzBop.com may also provide the opportunity to send e-mail to us. All 
        information collected is used only to respond to e-mail questions and/or 
        requests.</p>
      <p align="left" class="whiteText"><b class="yellowText">Use of Information</b><br>
        KidzBop.com uses or may use personally identifiable information that children 
        provide for such purposes as conducting contests or sweepstakes, and responding 
        to their questions regarding our products and services. KidzBop.com currently 
        does not disclose to third parties personally identifiable information 
        that children provide, except from time to time, we may transfer, disclose 
        or share such information with third parties who may be engaged by us 
        specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g. conducting 
        contests and sweepstakes). Such third parties have access to personal 
        information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for 
        other purposes. Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all 
        of the assets relating to KidzBop.com are transferred or sold to another 
        entity, personally identifiable information submitted to us may be transferred 
        to the acquiring entity. Finally, we may also disclose personally identifiable 
        information to third parties in order to comply with law or requests by 
        law enforcement agencies, to enforce our Terms and Conditions or to protect 
        the rights, property or safety of our website, users of our website and 
        others. </p>
