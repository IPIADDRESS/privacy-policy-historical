				<br>
				<b>Kidzworld Media Inc.</b> has developed this privacy statement to reflect our commitment to privacy because we want to assure that everything kids say and do on <b>Kidzworld</b> is totally protected. The privacy of our members is most important so please read on, as it will help you understand a little bit more about privacy.
<br>
				<br>
				We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server (big computers) and to administer our web site. IP addresses are used to help identify our members (you) and to collect broad demographic information (like your age, gender, regional information and what you like to do). Do not submit information to <b>Kidzworld</b> or anyone, for that matter, if it makes you feel uncomfortable.
<br>
				<br>
				Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information, e.g. name, e-mail address and demographic information like age, gender (boy/girl), general location and personal likes and dislikes. This information is used to get in touch with our members when necessary.
<br>
				<br>
				We do not make members confidential information available to anyone, at any time, for any reason. Parents can review their child's personal information, during and after the registration process once verifiable parental consent has been received by <b>Kidzworld</b>. Verifiable consent can be obtain by one of the following methods: obtaining a signed form from a parent via postal mail or facsimile; accepting and verifying a credit card number. Upon request, a parent may, delete or prohibit the further collection of their child's personal information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kidzworld.com">privacy@kidzworld.com</a> and clearly stating the nature of their inquiry. Any contact made with members will be through the facilities of <b>Kidzworld</b>.
<br>
				<br>
				Our site contains links to other sites. <b>Kidzworld</b> is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other such sites. <b>Kidzworld</b> makes its best effort to screen all sites accessible from <b>Kidzworld</b> to ensure that they comply with the standards set by <b>Kidzworld</b>.
<br>
				<br>
				Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products and services. We collect visitor's unique identifiers (like their <b>Kidzworld</b> on-screen name). These unique identifiers are collected from visitors to the site to verify the user identity and for use as account numbers in our record-keeping system.
<br>
				<br>
				We also run contests at our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address). The member contact information is used to contact the member when necessary. Members may opt-out of receiving future mailings by completing the "no thanks" item in the registration form.
<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Chat Rooms</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Kidzworld</b> has chat rooms, message boards, discussion groups and forums available to its members. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public domain information. You should <b>NOT</b> disclose any personal information. You should not enter any chat room, newsroom or forum on the Internet that requires you to disclose any personal information prior to entering. Your onscreen name is the only identity that you should have, and that is how people should know you on the Internet.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Security</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

				<br>
				<b>Childrenâ€™s Guidelines</b><br>
				<br>
				We caution children that they should not divulge their personal information and require that they agree to this before entering our chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups. Our chats are moderated, and while our moderators cannot prevent children from divulging personal information, they use their best efforts to ensure that personal information is not divulged.
<br>
				<br>

				<b><a name="coppa" href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.htm" target="_blank">CHILDRENâ€™S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT</a></b><br>
				<br>
				<b>COPPA (Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act)</b> became effective on April 21, 2000. The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children 12 years and younger. The Act spells out what we, as Web site operators, must include in our privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent and what responsibilities we, as Web site operators, have to protect and secure childrenâ€™s privacy and safety online.
<br>
				<br>
				<b>COPPA</b> applies to individual identifiable information about a child (12 or younger) that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number, or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact a child. The Act also applies to other types of information, such as hobbies, interests and user information gathered through the use of cookies and other methods of tracking, when they are tied to individually identifiable information.
<br>
				<br>
				<b>Kidzworld</b> is a strong advocate of privacy on the Internet and embraces the <b>Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</b>. We take extraordinary measures to ensure and secure the privacy and safety of our users.
