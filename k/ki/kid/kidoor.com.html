                    Networks may also utilize information about your visit in 
                    collective or aggregated data that does not identify you specifically. 
                    Our sites may collect some personally identifiable information 
                    about you. In the future, should Everyday Interactive Networks 
                    or any future owner of Everyday Interactive Networks decide 
                    to share our customers' transactional data with third parties, 
                    it will, in advance, provide notification and the opportunity 
                    for its users to indicate whether they would prefer the company 
                    not provide any identifiable information. Everyday Interactive 
                    Networks may occasionally send you information about our services.

                    the appropriate check box when registering for any personalized

                    privacy by limiting employee access to and use of customer 
                    data and encrypting customer passwords. If you choose not
