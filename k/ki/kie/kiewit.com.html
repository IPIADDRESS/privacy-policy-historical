<p>Peter Kiewit Sons’, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates and vendors 
  ("Kiewit") own and operate a number of Internet domains, including 
  but not limited to this Website (the "Website").</p>
<p>This statement describes Kiewit's Website privacy policies.</p>
<p><u><strong>Note:</strong></u> In this Privacy Policy, we described certain 
  practices apply only to our on-line store (“Kiewit Company Store”). 
  Please read these carefully if you are visiting, or intend to visit, the Kiewit 
  Company Store. Should you have any questions about our store privacy policy, 
  or our privacy policy in general, please send your questions to <a href="mailto:webmaster@kiewit.com">webmaster@kiewit.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is rapidly changing the way we communicate and interact. While 
  the Internet may provide access to more information and services than ever before, 
  online activities raise new challenges, such as the privacy issues addressed 
  in this policy. We welcome your feedback regarding this Website and our Privacy 
  Policy. Please address all comments to <a href="mailto:webmaster@kiewit.com">webmaster@kiewit.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What Information is Collected?</strong></p>
<p>You may be asked at various times to provide data such as your name, e-mail 
  address and phone number (the "Personally Identifiable Information"), 
  as well as information about what you like or do not like about the Website. 
  Kiewit collects Personally Identifiable Information online primarily to make 
  it easier for you to use the Website, to allow us to improve our website and 
  our services, and for us to communicate with you. Kiewit will collect additional 
  information about you before you can purchase an item from the Kiewit Company 
  Store. We collect and store such information as is necessary to process your 
  purchase, fulfill your order, and improve the operation of our store.</p>
<p>Our data collection policies are intended to allow you to choose how much 
  Personally Identifiable Information to provide to us. Our goal is to provide 
  you with a satisfying online experience.</p>
<p>Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or 
  personally identifiable:</p>
<p>Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot easily be tied back 
  to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visit 
  this Privacy Policy page today, but we do not necessarily know their names, 
  where they live, or their date of birth.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information tells us who you are. We may need this 
  information to provide personalized or enhanced service that you request. We 
  also need Personally Identifiable Information and to maintain your store account 
  once you choose to establish one and to process orders you place at the Kiewit 
  Company Store. While we hope that you will find it beneficial to judiciously 
  provide Personally Identifiable Information so that we can provide the best 
  practical service to you, the amount of Personally Identifiable Information 
  that you choose to disclose is a decision you make.</p>
<p>When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser automatically transmits 
  some information to Kiewit every time you access our Website. Examples of such 
  information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), 
  the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, and the 
  browser version you are using to access our site. Some of this information may 
  be collected by Kiewit to help us improve our Website and our services. For 
  instance, we may use this information to ensure the content you request is presented 
  in the best format.</p>
<p>To activate some of the features available within the Website, we may assign 
  "cookies" to your Internet browser. On our system, a cookie is a small 
  text file that contains a unique identification number stored on your computer. 
  This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser to our 
  server computers when you interact with our Website. When you agree to provide 
  Personally Identifiable Information directly to us, such as through registering 
  at the Kiewit Company Store, we will assign cookies that identify you, personally, 
  to our servers.</p>
<p>Following are our responses to some likely questions regarding our Privacy 
  Policy:</p>
<p><strong>What organization is collecting the information?</strong></p>
<p>The data you provide is collected by Kiewit, or by our vendor in the case 
  of the Kiewit Company Store. Some areas of our Website read data that creates, 
  or has created, an Anonymous Profile. Other areas, such as the Kiewit Company 
  Store, require you to register or login before you can purchase an item. These 
  areas read and store Personally Identifiable Information that specifically identifies 
  you to our servers. The Kiewit Company Store requires you to provide Personally 
  Identifiable Information through registration before you can place an order.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note for persons under 18 years old:</strong> The Kiewit Company 
  Store does not sell items to anyone under the age of 18. Nor are persons under 
  18 years old eligible to use any Kiewit Website feature that collects Personally 
  Identifiable Information. If you are under 18 years old and wish to purchase 
  an item from the Kiewit Company Store or use a Website feature that requests 
  Personally Identifiable Information, you must do so through a parent or guardian.</p>
<p><strong>How will the Anonymous Profile Information be used?</strong></p>
<p>Below is a description of some of the uses of the information that we collect 
  and how our users benefit from these actions:</p>
<p>We try to pay attention to what our users use and do not use on our Website, 
  and we modify our content appropriately. Many of the pages in our Website collect 
  Anonymous Profile Information. The creation of an anonymous profile allows Kiewit 
  to identify the information that users find most useful. We may use these anonymous 
  profiles to improve our Website's content and format, and our company’s 
  services. This is essential to our ability to provide high quality content to 
  you.</p>
<p><strong>How will the Personally Identifiable Information be used?</strong></p>
<p>The Kiewit Company Store will collect and store Personally Identifiable Information 
  once you register for an on-line account at the store. This includes primary 
  contact information including a valid email address, information about your 
  identity, shipping information, and other personal information as requested 
  by the forms on our Website. When you purchase an item, we collect additional 
  billing and credit card information if you have not provided that information 
  during the registration process. We use this information to verify your identity 
  and to bill you for your purchase.</p>
<p>Other areas of our Website may require that you provide Personally Identifiable 
  Information to use a Website feature. We may use this information for internal 
  research regarding the use of our Website and to facilitate the feature you 
  choose to use.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, we indicate the informational fields that are required 
  to purchase an item, register, or to use a feature we offer. You have the option 
  of not providing this information to us by choosing to not purchase an item, 
  not register, or not use the related feature of our Website.</p>
<p>If you correspond with us through letters or email messages, we may store such 
  correspondence with whatever other information you have provided to us. By submitting 
  such correspondence, you agree that we may contact you in response.</p>
<p>In addition to the uses described in this section, Kiewit will use the Personally 
  Identifiable Information you provide to us and information we collect about 
  your use of our Website to improve access to our Website, improve the content 
  and organization of our Website, revise the items in the Kiewit Company Store, 
  resolve disputes, and correct technical problems with the Website.</p>
<p><strong>What information will we distribute?</strong></p>
<p>Kiewit’s policy is to retain Personally Identifiable Information you 
  submit to us, only for our use and that of our affiliated companies (including, 
  our vendor in the case of the Kiewit Company Store). We do not sell your Personally 
  Identifiable Information to third parties. But although we use industry standard 
  hardware and software designed to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee—and 
  you should not expect—that the Personally Identifiable Information you 
  submit to us will always remain confidential.</p>
<p>If you register with our Website, either at the Kiewit Company Store or elsewhere, 
  you will be required to choose a user name and a password (when you register 
  at the Kiewit Company Store, your user name will be your primary email address). 
  You are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of both. Should you allow 
  another to access our Website through your user name and password, Kiewit will 
  assume that you are accessing our Website and you will be responsible for all 
  actions taken in your name. By using our Website, you accept responsibility 
  for all activity undertaken in your name.</p>
<p>If you register with us, you will have the option of accessing and changing 
  your password. You may also change certain other information you provided to 
  us. If you have any questions, send an email message to <a href="mailto:webmaster@kiewit.com">webmaster@kiewit.com</a>. 
  Our server computers may retain whatever Personally Identifiable Information 
  you have provided to us, and such data could potentially be made available for 
  distribution to third parties as required by law, such as to law-enforcement 
  agencies or pursuant to subpoenas or other court orders. Kiewit may also share 
  both Anonymous Profile Information and Personally Identifiable Information to 
  investigate allegations of fraud or other unlawful activities, civil offenses, 
  and violations of our Terms and Conditions of Use. In such case, Kiewit shall 
  have no obligation to notify you of, or to decline, any appropriately documented 
  request for Personally Identifiable Information or Anonymous Profile Information.</p>
<p>This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Kiewit 
  Websites. Kiewit does not control the information collection and distribution 
  policies on Internet domains other than on Kiewit Internet domains. As a service 
  to our users, the Kiewit Website may provide links to other sites. Kiewit is 
  not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage 
  all users to read the privacy statements of each and every Website.</p>
<p><strong>What choices are available regarding collection, use, and distribution 
  of the information?</strong></p>
<p>We encourage you to share information only with those websites that provide 
  true value to you in exchange for your information and that commit to privacy 
  practices that are acceptable to you. We believe that Kiewit's websites provide 
  such value, but it is ultimately your choice to share Personally Identifiable 
  Information with Kiewit.</p>
<p>While Kiewit does not sell any Personally Identifiable Information you submit 
  to our Website to any other parties, Kiewit reserves the right to use such information 
  for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to recruiting, marketing, 
  performance monitoring and statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Kiewit reserves the right to update this policy. When we do, we will send 
  an announcement by email to the primary email address of each registered user 
  or by placing a notice on our Website.</p>
<p>Kiewit also reserves the right to send registration confirmations, Service 
  Alerts and similar messages to our users to inform them of specific changes 
  that may impact their ability to use our Website, regardless of such users' 
  e-mail contact opt-in status. Kiewit retains these rights because we may need 
  the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that may be 
  important to you.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be submitted via e-mail to 
  webmaster@kiewit.com If we have not responded to your inquiry in a timely manner 
  or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact us at 
  402-342-2052, extension 2685. Our mailing address is: ______________ Kiewit 
  Plaza, Omaha, Nebraska 68131.
