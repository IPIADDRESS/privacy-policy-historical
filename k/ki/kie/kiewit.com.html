			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>		
					
						
			<p>Peter Kiewit Sons', Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Kiewit") own and operate a number of Internet domains, including but not limited to this Website (the "Website"). This statement describes Kiewit's Website privacy policies.</p>

			<h4>Privacy Philosophy</h4>
			<p>The Internet is rapidly changing the way we communicate and interact. While the Internet may provide access to more information and services than ever before, 
			online activities raise new challenges, such as the privacy issues addressed in this policy. We welcome your feedback regarding this Website and our Privacy Policy. 
			Please address all comments to <a href="mailto:webmaster@kiewit.com">webmaster@kiewit.com</a>.</p>
			
			<h4>What Information is Collected?</h4>
			<p>You may be asked at various times to provide data such as your name, e-mail address and phone number (the "Personally Identifiable Information"), as well as 
			information about what you like or do not like about the Website. Kiewit collects Personally Identifiable Information online primarily to make it easier for you 
			to use the Website, to allow us to improve our website and our services, and for us to communicate with you.</p>
			
			<p>Our data collection policies are intended to allow you to choose how much Personally Identifiable Information to provide to us. Information collected online is 
			often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:</p>
			
			<p>Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot easily be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visit this 
			Privacy Policy page today, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth.</p>
			
			<p>Personally Identifiable Information tells us who you are. We may need this information to provide personalized or enhanced service that you request. While we 
			hope that you will find it beneficial to judiciously provide Personally Identifiable Information so that we can provide the best practical service to you, the 
			amount of Personally Identifiable Information that you choose to disclose is a decision you make.</p>
			
			<p>When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser automatically transmits some information to Kiewit every time you access our Website. Examples of such 
			information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, and 
			the browser version you are using to access our site. Some of this information may be collected by Kiewit to help us improve our Website and our services. For 
			instance, we may use this information to ensure the content you request is presented in the best format.</p>
			
			<p>To activate some of the features available within the Website, we may assign "cookies" to your Internet browser. On our system, a cookie is a small text file 
			that contains a unique identification number stored on your computer. This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser to our server 
			computers when you interact with our Website. When you agree to provide Personally Identifiable Information directly to us, we may assign cookies that identify 
			you, personally, to our servers.</p>
			
			<h4>What organization is collecting the information?</h4>
			<p>The data you provide is collected by Kiewit. Some areas of our Website read data that creates, or has created, an Anonymous Profile. Other areas require you 
			to register or login before you can access an area of the Website. These areas read and store Personally Identifiable Information that specifically identifies 
			you to our servers.</p>
			
			<h4>How will the Anonymous Profile Information be used?</h4>
			<p>Below is a description of some of the uses of the information that we collect and how our users benefit from these actions:</p>
			
			<p>We try to pay attention to what our users use and do not use on our Website, and we modify our content appropriately. Many of the pages in our Website collect Anonymous Profile Information. The creation of an anonymous profile allows Kiewit to identify the information that users find most useful. We may use these anonymous profiles to improve our Website's content and format, and our company's services. This is essential to our ability to provide high quality content to you.</p>
			
			<h4>How will the Personally Identifiable Information be used?</h4>
			<p>Our Website may require that you provide Personally Identifiable Information to use a Website feature. We may use this information for internal research regarding 
			the use of our Website and to facilitate the feature you choose to use.</p>
			
			<p>To the extent possible, we indicate the informational fields that are required to use a feature we offer. You have the option of not providing this information 
			to us by choosing to not use the related feature of our Website.</p>
			
			<p>If you correspond with us through letters or email messages, we may store such correspondence with whatever other information you have provided to us. By submitting 
			such correspondence, you agree that we may contact you in response.</p>
			
			<p>In addition to the uses described in this section, Kiewit will use the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us and information we collect about your 
			use of our Website to improve access to our Website, improve the content and organization of our Website, resolve disputes, and correct technical problems with the 
			Website.</p>
			
			<h4>What information will we distribute?</h4>
			<p>Kiewit's policy is to retain Personally Identifiable Information you submit to us, only for our use and that of our affiliated companies. We do not sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. But although we use industry standard hardware and software designed to protect your privacy, we cannot guaranteeâ€”and you should not expectâ€”that the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to us will always remain confidential</p>
			
			<p>If a feature of our Website requires that you register with our Website, you will be required to choose a user name and a password You are responsible for protecting 
			the confidentiality of both. Should you allow another to access our Website through your user name and password, Kiewit will assume that you are accessing our Website 
			and you will be responsible for all actions taken in your name. By using our Website, you accept responsibility for all activity undertaken in your name.</p>
			
			<p>If you register with us, you will have the option of accessing and changing your password. You may also change certain other information you provided to us. If you 
			have any questions, send an email message to <a href="mailto:webmaster@kiewit.com">webmaster@kiewit.com</a>. Our server computers may retain whatever Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to us, 
			and such data could potentially be made available for distribution to third parties as required by law, such as to law-enforcement agencies or pursuant to subpoenas or 
			other court orders. Kiewit may also share both Anonymous Profile Information and Personally Identifiable Information to investigate allegations of fraud or other 
			unlawful activities, civil offenses, and violations of our Terms and Conditions of Use. In such case, Kiewit shall have no obligation to notify you of, or to decline, 
			any appropriately documented request for Personally Identifiable Information or Anonymous Profile Information.</p>
			
			<p>This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Kiewit Websites. Kiewit does not control the information collection and distribution policies 
			on Internet domains other than on Kiewit Internet domains. As a service to our users, the Kiewit Website may provide links to other sites. Kiewit is not responsible 
			for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage all users to read the privacy statements of each and every Website.</p>
			
			<h4>What choices are available regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information?</h4>
			<p>We encourage you to share information only with those websites that provide true value to you in exchange for your information and that commit to privacy practices that are acceptable to you. We believe that Kiewit's websites provide such value, but it is ultimately your choice to share Personally Identifiable Information with Kiewit.</p>
			
			<p>While Kiewit does not sell any Personally Identifiable Information you submit to our Website to any other parties, Kiewit reserves the right to use such information 
			for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to recruiting, marketing, performance monitoring and statistical analysis.</p>
			
			<p>Kiewit reserves the right to update this policy. When we do, we will place a notice on our Website.</p>
			
			<p>Kiewit also reserves the right to send registration confirmations, Service Alerts and similar messages to our users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use our Website, regardless of such users' e-mail contact opt-in status. Kiewit retains these rights because we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that may be important to you.</p>
			
			<p>Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be submitted via e-mail to <a href="mailto:webmaster@kiewit.com">webmaster@kiewit.com</a> If we have not responded to your inquiry in a timely manner or your 
			inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact us at 402-342-2052, and request to speak with the Director of the Corporate Business Development Department. 
			Our mailing address is: ______________ Kiewit Plaza, Omaha, Nebraska 68131.</p>
