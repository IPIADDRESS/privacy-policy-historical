      <p>Peter Kiewit Sons', Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Kiewit") 
        own and operate a number of Internet domains, including but not limited 
        to this Website (the "Website").</p>
      <p>This statement describes Kiewit's Website privacy practices.</p>
      <p><b>Privacy Philosophy</b></p>
      <p>The Internet is rapidly changing the way we communicate and interact. 
        While the Internet may provide access to more information and services 
        than ever before, these new online activities raise new challenges, such 
        as the privacy issues addressed in this policy. We welcome your feedback 
        regarding this Website and our Privacy Policy. Please address all comments 
        to webmaster@kiewit.com.</p>
      <b>What Information is Collected</b>
      <p>You may be asked at various times to provide data such as your name, 
        e-mail address and phone number (the "Personally Identifiable Information"), 
        as well as information about what you like or do not like about the Website. 
        Kiewit collects Personally Identifiable Information online primarily to 
        make it easier for you to use the Website and for us to communicate with 
        you.</p>
      <p>Our data collection policies are intended to allow you to choose how 
        much Personally Identifiable Information to provide to us, and to control 
        how we use that information. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying 
        online experience.</p>
      <p>Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous 
        or personally identifiable:</p>
      <p>Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back 
        to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 10,000 people 
        visit this Privacy Policy page today, but we do not necessarily know their 
        names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from transactions 
        such as this constitutes anonymous information.</p>
      <p>Personally Identifiable Information tells us who you are. We may need 
        this information to provide personalized or enhanced service that you 
        request. While we hope that you will find it beneficial to judiciously 
        provide Personally Identifiable Information so that we can provide the 
        best practical service to you, the amount of Personally Identifiable Information 
        that you choose to disclose is completely up to you. The only way we know 
        something about you personally is if you choose to share this type of 
        information with us.</p>
      <p>When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser automatically transmits 
        some information to Kiewit every time you access our Website. Examples 
        of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known 
        as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the 
        computer you are using, and the browser version you are using to access 
        our site. Some of this information may be collected by Kiewit to help 
        us improve our offerings to you. For instance, we may use this information 
        to ensure the content you request is presented in the best format.</p>
      <p>To activate some of the features available within the Website, we may 
        assign "cookies" to your Internet browser. On our system, a 
        cookie is a small text file that contains a unique identification number 
        stored on your computer. Our cookies by themselves cannot be used to find 
        out the identity of any user. This unique identification number automatically 
        identifies your browser - but not you - to our server computers when you 
        interact with our Website. When you visit our Website, our server computers 
        read your cookie. The contents of your cookie are reported in our server 
        logs. But it is only when you agree to provide Personally Identifiable 
        Information directly to a service, such as through registration, that 
        we will be able to know anything about you other than the random number 
        that our server computers originally assign to your browser.</p>
      <p>There is a lot of confusion about cookies, how they are used, and what 
        they can do. On our system, cookies only contain information that our 
        server computer "knew" in the first place, and can only be read 
        by the serving domain that placed them. Cookies are an essential part 
        of how the Internet works today, and allow our server computers to recognize 
        your computer's browser when you return. Since our cookies are only text 
        files, they cannot "run" on your computer and have no ability 
        to search your computer for other information, or transmit it to anyone.</p>
      Following are our responses to some likely questions regarding our Privacy Policy:
      <p><b>What organization is collecting the information?</b></p>
      <p>The data you provide is collected by Kiewit.</p>
      <b>How will the information be used?</b>
      <p>Below is a description of some of the uses of the information that we 
        collect and how our users benefit from these actions:</p>
      <p>We try to pay attention to what our users use and do not use on our Website 
        and modify our content appropriately. The creation of an anonymous profile 
        allows Kiewit to identify the information that you find most useful, without 
        ever knowing your name or any other Personally Identifiable Information. 
        We may use these anonymous profiles to improve our Website's content and 
        format. This is essential to our ability to provide high quality content 
        to you.</p>
      <p>We do not match "Who you are" with "Where you've been" 
        on the Internet, because we do not use personal data characteristics such 
        as your name, address or phone number to create these anonymous profiles 
        but rather use general information such as browser version and IP address. 
        Finally, our anonymous profiles present no privacy risk to our customers 
        because they are worthless to third parties. Since any potential third 
        party would be unable to read the cookies that we set on our domains, 
        only Kiewit can create value from these anonymous profiles.</p>
      <p>We develop summary - but not individual - reports. An example of a summary 
        report might be "12,000 people visited Page 'X' today, and of those 
        people, 75% had browser version "X".</p>
      <b>What information will you distribute?</b>
      <p>If you provide Personally Identifiable Information to us, it is our plan 
        to limit its use to the Kiewit Website.</p>
      <p>However, our server computers may retain whatever Personally Identifiable 
        Information you have provided to us, and such data could potentially be 
        made available for distribution to third parties as required by law, such 
        as to law-enforcement agencies or pursuant to subpoenas or other court 
        orders. In such case, Kiewit shall have no obligation to notify you of, 
        or decline, any appropriately documented request for Personally Identifiable 
        Information.</p>
      <p>This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the 
        Kiewit Websites. Kiewit does not control the information collection and 
        distribution policies on Internet domains other than on Kiewit Internet 
        domains. As a service to our users, the Kiewit Website may provide links 
        to other sites. Kiewit is not responsible for the privacy practices of 
        such other sites. We encourage all users to read the privacy statements 
        of each and every Website.</p>
      <b>What choices are available regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information?</b>
      <p>We encourage you to share information only with those websites that provide 
        true value to you in exchange for your information and that commit to 
        privacy practices that are acceptable to you. We believe that Kiewit's 
        websites provide such value, but it is ultimately your choice to share 
        Personally Identifiable Information with Kiewit.</p>
      <p>While Kiewit does not intend to sell any information you submit to our 
        Website to any other parties, Kiewit reserves the right to use such information 
        for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to recruiting, marketing, 
        performance monitoring and statistical analysis.</p>
      <p>Kiewit also reserves the right to send registration confirmations, Service 
        Alerts and similar messages to our users to inform them of specific changes 
        that may impact their ability to use our Website, regardless of such users' 
        e-mail contact opt-in status. Kiewit retains these rights because we may 
        need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters 
        that may be important to you.</p>
      <p>Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be submitted via e-mail 
        to <a href="mailto:webmaster@kiewit.com">webmaster@kiewit.com</a> If we 
        have not responded to your inquiry in a timely manner or your inquiry 
        has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact us at 402-342-2052, 
        extension 2685.
