        <p><strong>The right to be forgotten.</strong> You may request the deletion of any email we hold on you at any time. Noye that requesting deletion is total and irreversible. This means 
        that we will also lose any records of you having ever been on our systems, including any previous order data. If you re-join our systems, by voluntarily providing your personal 
        information, you will appear to us as a completely new data subject. To request deletion of your personal information, contact privacy@kieselguitars.com using the email address we hold 
        for you or otherwise proving your identity. </p>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>
<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>
<p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

<p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.</p>    
<ul>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
        <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service.

<h3>Payments</h3>
<p>We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).</p>
<p>We will not store your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by 
their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, 
Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information. Kiesel Guitars is fully PCI-compliant, and our
PCI Compliance Officer runs regular scans to ensure this compliance is maintained.</p>
<p>The payment processors we work with are:</p>

                                                <li>
