                (such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) collected online on the

                we will contact you and get your permission first. <br>
              <br>
               This information is critical to our business and as such, it would be treated like our other

              <b></b></a><b><a name="priv_2"></a>How We Use Information </b>
              <br><br> Covista uses the information we collect online principally to provide you with the 
               service you have ordered and to inform you of other offerings that you may find interesting. 
               Postal and e-mail address information enable us to communication with you about services 
               offered and ordered, as well as the proper provisioning and billing of those services.<br>

              <br>Covista may use third-party vendors to carry out certain functions in marketing and delivering 
               services to you (such as processing data files and sending you new order fulfillment information), 
               and so shares online data with those vendors to the extent necessary for them to perform their 
               work. Such partners and vendors must use that personally identifiable information only for 
               the purpose(s) for which it was shared and protect it from any further use. Covista also shares 
               such information with other industry and credit-related organizations to improve operations and 
               to protect against fraud, security and credit risks.<br>

               <br>We also provide personally identifiable online information in response to subpoenas and 
                other legal demands, and where we believe that disclosing this information is necessary to 
                identify, contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety 
                or interfering with Covista property or services.

               <br>
               <b><a name="priv_3"></a>How We Collect Information</b>
               <br><br>Covista collects information online and other by asking you for it. A 
                 customer's name, address (postal and e-mail) and telephone number are the most 
                 important pieces of information, but we might request other information, based on, 
                 for example, the service(s) being ordered or promoted.<br><br>

               Covista may also use "cookies" and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to 
                our sites or your responses to email from us - both individually and in aggregated data that 
                does not identify you. These reporting tools tell us the parts of our Web site or emails in which 
                you showed an interest or took some action, and help us improve the quality and usefulness 
                of our sites.<br>
               <br>

               At Covista, we primarily use cookies to determine what services or promotions you are 
                 interested in. While cookies help us improve your experience while visiting our site 
                 and customize our communications to the services you may desire, you have the option 
                 to block them through your internet browser or other commercially available software. 
                 However, doing so may make some of our site's features unavailable to you.<br>

               <br>
               Another way in which we collect information online is through our affinity program 
                 partners who may provide us with information they have already obtained from you 
                 online or other. For example, when you are on a partner's site and click on a Covista 
                 banner that takes you to the Covista site, information that the partner has received 
                 from you already may be passed to Covista.

                 help protect the accuracy and security of your personal information and prevent 
                 unauthorized access or improper use. For example, you will note that while using 
                 some features of the Covista website and online services, you will need to submit 
                 a password or some other type of authenticating information.<br><br>

               <br><br>You may review or update the available personally identifiable information 
                 that we received from you online by accessing your account online, by contacting 
                 Consumer Service at (1-800-323-6875), or through the company contact information 
                 below. Please note that in order to better protect you and safeguard your

               Covista may use e-mail addresses that you provide to us to send you information 
               related to Covista products and services. If at any time you would prefer not to

               <b><a name="priv_6"></a>Customer Proprietary Network Information</b>
               <br><br>"Customer Proprietary Network Information," or "CPNI" is a broad term that 
                 encompasses two main categories of information which carriers like Covista collect 
                 and use in order to conduct business and offer telephone and data services. First, 
                 CPNI includes, among other things, individually identifiable information indicating 
                 to whom, where, and when a customer places a call, as well as the types of service 
                 offerings to which a customer subscribes and how much any particular service is used. 
                 Second, "aggregate customer" information, is collective data that relates to a group 
                 or category of service or customers from which individual customer characteristics 
                 have been removed. <br>
                 
               <br><strong>Collection, Use and Disclosure</strong><br><br>
                 Typically, companies like Covista collect the data described above through the 
                 ordinary course of the customer-carrier relationship. When necessary, Covista 
                 uses such information to fulfill orders, provide service, bill, and communicate 
                 with customers. We may also use such data to develop new products or services 
                 tailored to fit customers' specific needs.<br><br>
                 
               Covista protects all CPNI in the control of Covista, and treats such information in a manner 
                 consistent and in compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements.  <br>

                 
               <br><a href="#">Return to the Top</a><br>
               
               <br><strong>"Individually Identifiable" CPNI </strong><br><br> 
               Covista will not sell, trade, or disclose to unaffiliated third parties any individually 
                 identifiable customer information without the consent of the customer. As used in this 
                 Privacy Policy, "unaffiliated third parties" do not include Covista's agents or affiliates 
                 that sell or provide communications-related services, its joint venture partners, or 
                 independent contractors. <br><br>
               However, Covista, its agents and affiliates that provide communications-related services, 
                 its joint venture partners or independent contractors may use, disclose, or permit 
                 unaffiliated third parties to access customers' individually identifiable CPNI in order 
                 to (1) initiate, render, bill, and collect for telecommunications service; (2) protect 
                 Covista's rights or property, or to protect customers and other carriers from the 
                 fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such service; or (3) to 
                 provide any inbound telemarketing, referral, or administrative service to the customer 
                 for the duration of the call, if such call was initiated by the customer and the customer 
                 approves of the use of such information to provide such service.<br><br>
               Please note that in order to better serve your communications needs and to identify, 
                 offer and provide products and services to meet your requirements, we need your 
                 permission to share this information among our affiliates and agents and their 
                 subsidiaries. The protection of your information is important to us, and we acknowledge 
                 that you have a right, and we have a duty, under federal and state law, to protect 
                 the confidentiality of your CPNI. <br><br>
               You have a right to keep your CPNI private by "opting out." Unless you provide us with 
                 notice that you wish to opt out within 30 days of us providing notice to you in your 
                 bill or through the mail, we will assume that you give us the right to share your CPNI 
                 with the authorized companies as described above. CPNI will not be shared with unrelated 
                 third parties. You may opt out by calling us at 1-800-323-6875.<br>

               <br><strong>"Aggregate Customer" Information</strong><br><br> 
               Covista also gathers a variety of aggregate customer information, including, but not limited 
                 to, the number and frequency of calls into our Customer Care Department and visits to 
                 Covista's website and its different pages. Web visits are monitored through the use of 
                 "cookies." A cookie is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you 
                 visit certain websites. Covista may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track 
                 information for statistical purposes to improve the products and service we provide and 
                 to manage our telecommunications networks. As explained in more detail below, Covista 
                 may share with unaffiliated third parties such aggregate information.<br><br>
               Non-Covista websites may require you to accept cookies. We do not control use of these 
                 cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.<br><br>
