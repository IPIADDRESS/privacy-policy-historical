<p>This Privacy Policy is part of KISSmetrics’ <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> and describes the privacy practices of KISSmetrics.  It explains when and how KISSmetrics collects end user and client information, including Personally Identifiable Information (defined below), how we use such information, and the circumstances under which we may disclose such information to others.</p>

<p>By visiting the KISSmetrics website, visiting a KISSmetrics client website that provides notice of its use of KISSmetrics and/or this policy, or registering for our service, you acknowledge that you accept and consent to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies other than KISSmetrics, or to individuals whom KISSmetrics does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which KISSmetrics may disclose Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  Please refer to the privacy policies of these third parties for information concerning their privacy practices.</p>

<h4>Visitors to KISSmetrics’ Clients’ Websites</h4>

<p>Our Clients may use customized and proprietary KISSmetrics’ code, software and/or services (“Service”) to obtain information regarding the activities that users engage in while visiting their web pages (“Client’s User Data”). When a user visits a website that uses KISSmetrics’ Service, KISSmetrics code contained on the website contacts KISSmetrics’ servers and enables KISSmetrics to collect Client’s User Data. Some Clients may also use their own code to obtain Client’s User Data and then send such information to KISSmetrics’ servers.</p>

<p>Client’s User Data is stored on KISSmetrics’ web servers and databases for use in performing analysis and producing reports for the KISSmetrics Client only.  Please note that KISSmetrics itself uses the KISSmetrics Service in order to obtain insights into visitors’ activities on http://www.kissmetrics.com and http://blog.KISSmetrics.com/.</p>

<p>KISSmetrics’ collection and analysis of Client’s User Data helps our Clients to evaluate and understand how their users are interacting with their websites, and potentially, to modify their websites in order to make them more valuable or useful for their users.  KISSmetrics’ Clients determine the types of Client’s User Data that are sent to KISSmetrics’ servers for analysis.  This data may include or be linked to Personally Identifiable Information depending on how the Client uses KISSmetrics’ Services on its website(s).</p>

<p>In addition, KISSmetrics may collect certain information about a Client’s Visitor’s computer that may be provided by the Visitor’s browser.  This includes browser information, operating system information, mobile device information, IP address, time of visit, and the referring site, application, or service.  Such information is collected even though not determined not determined by the Client.</p>

<p>Because Clients have the sole discretion to determine what Information KISSmetrics collects about or from the Clients’ users, this Privacy Policy <em>does not</em> apply to any Client’s User Data, including Personally Identifiable Information, that KISSmetrics may collect, obtain, or access in connection with operating the KISSmetrics Service.</p>

<h3>How Do We Use This Information?</h3>

<h4>Visitors to the KISSmetrics Website</h4>

<p>We use the KISSmetrics Client Information, including Personally Identifiable Information, to register your account, fulfill your requests, understand how you are engaging with KISSmetrics, communicate with you, determine if you are satisfied with the Service, process billing for KISSmetrics Services, and personalize your experience on the KISSmetrics website and with the KISSmetrics Service.</p>

<p>We may also use KISSmetrics User Information to facilitate the delivery of content or advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you about new or existing products and services or special offers.  For more information on opting out of these communications, please see the section on “<a href="#user-privacy-controls">User Privacy Controls</a>” below.</p>

<h4>Visitors to the KISSmetrics Blog</h4>

<p>We may use information you voluntarily provide when visiting the KISSmetrics blog to send you e-mail communications, such as information on upcoming webinars, and to understand how you are engaging with and perceive KISSmetrics’ Services.</p>

<h4>Visitors to KISSmetrics’ Clients’ Websites</h4>

<p>Except as described in the “Disclosure of Information to Third Parties” section below (Insert LINK), KISSmetrics never sells or shares any Client’s User Data with individuals or companies other than the specific Client whose website transmitted the Client’s User Data to KISSmetrics.</p>

<p>KISSmetrics does not collect or aggregate information about end user behavior across multiple, different websites that are operated by different Clients, nor does it use any Client’s User Data for purposes of behavioral advertising.  However, KISSmetrics may analyze Client User Data in the aggregate for purposes of internal research and/or to determine overall trends or metrics concerning how users are engaging with websites, and may report such general trends publicly, without disclosing any Client User Data.</p>

<h4>Our Client’s Use of KISSmetrics</h4>

<p>KISSmetrics contractually requires its Clients to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including laws relating to privacy and data collection.  KISSmetrics also contractually requires its Clients to obtain any necessary consents from visitors to its website(s) for the Client’s use of KISSmetrics’ services, and to post an online privacy policy that provides each visitor with clear notice of its practices regarding data collection, use, and disclosure (including the Client’s use of KISSmetrics), along with a link to the KISSmetrics Privacy Policy and to the <a href="/user-privacy">KISSmetrics Service Opt-Out</a> (<a href="#user-privacy-controls">discussed below</a>).</p>

<p>KISSmetrics has no control over its Clients’ activities or the disclosures made by its Clients in their privacy policies or on their websites, however, and it cannot be held responsible for any Client’s failure to make these disclosures on its website or for any Client’s use or collection of Client’s User Data that is not permitted under this Privacy Policy or otherwise.  For more details on the terms that apply to our Clients’ use of the KISSmetrics Service, please see Section 4 (“Privacy”) in the <a href="/terms">KISSmetrics Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<h3>KISSmetrics’ Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>KISSmetrics uses cookies (small text files that KISSmetrics stores locally on your computer) on our Client’s websites for one or more of the following purposes: to help identify unique visitors and/or devices; assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify visitor preferences; conduct A/B testing; diagnose problems with our servers, and otherwise administer the KISSmetrics Service. KISSmetrics does not use methods such as browser cache, Flash cookies, or eTags, for acquiring or storing information about end users web browsing activity on Client websites or otherwise.</p>

<p>Depending on how our Clients use KISSmetrics’ Services, information contained in KISSmetrics cookies placed on the computers of end users may be linked to Personally Identifiable Information in KISSmetrics’ database.  This allows our Clients to use the KISSmetrics Service to better analyze and measure their users’ interactions with their website and to organize activities by the same user on their website across time.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to have KISSmetrics place and use cookies on your computer, you should set your browser preferences to refuse all cookies before accessing KISSmetrics or other websites that may use KISSmetrics.  KISSmetrics is not responsible for any failure by you or your browser to accurately implement or communicate your browser preferences or settings.  In addition, please be aware that even if you configure your browser settings to reject all cookies, your activity on KISSmetrics client websites will still be recorded by our Service, unless you opt out of our Service as <a href="#user-privacy-controls">set forth below</a>.  However, your rejection of all cookies will prevent KISSmetrics from determining whether or not someone using your computer has previously visited the website, i.e., whether or not the visitor is a “unique” visitor.</p>

<p>Please note that if you set your browser to reject cookies, some features of the websites you visit may be unavailable.  For more information on how to reject cookies, see your browser's instructions on changing your cookie settings.  Additionally, please note that rejecting cookies may also prevent you from <a href="/user-privacy">opting out of our Service</a> because that involves placing an opt-out cookie in your browser.</p>

<p>If you do not elect to set your browser preferences to refuse cookies, you consent to have cookies, including cookies used by KISSmetrics, placed on your computer when you visit our Client’s websites.</p>

<h4>Web Beacons</h4>

<p>KISSmetrics may also collect certain information using Web Beacons. Web Beacons are electronic images that may be used on KISSmetrics’ Website, in KISSmetrics’ Service, or in our email communications.  They are used, for example, to count website visits or to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>

<h4>Service Providers</h4>

<p>Information, including KISSmetrics Client Information, Client’s User Data, and any Personally Identifiable Information contained therein, may be shared with certain third-party companies and individuals that help facilitate technical and administrative aspects of the KISSmetrics Service (e.g., credit card processing), or perform functions related to the administration of KISSmetrics (e.g. hosting services).  These third parties perform tasks on our behalf and are contractually obligated not to disclose or use KISSmetrics User Information or Client’s User Data for any other purpose, and to employ adequate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to such data.  However, KISSmetrics is not responsible in the event that Personally Identifiable Information is disclosed at a result of a breach or security lapse by any such third party.</p>

<h4>KISSmetrics Partners</h4>

<p>If you are a KISSmetrics Client that signed up through our Partners Program, your KISSmetrics Client Information may be shared with the Partner Program member that signed you up for KISSmetrics’ Service. These Partner Program members may use that information to help you setup, adjust, manage, and cancel your account with KISSmetrics.</p>

<h4>Law Enforcement and Legal Process</h4>

<p>KISSmetrics also reserves the right to disclose any KISSmetrics Client Information or Client User Information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to: (i) comply with any law, regulation, or legal request; (ii) enforce, apply, or investigate breaches of the Terms of Use or other agreements; (iii) respond to client requests; or (iv) protect the rights, property, user experience, or safety of KISSmetrics, our employees, our users, or others.</p>

<h4>Change of Control</h4>

<p>If KISSmetrics, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired by another company or successor entity, KISSmetrics Client Information and/or Client’s User Data will be one of the assets transferred or acquired by the purchaser or successor.  You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any purchaser of or successor to KISSmetrics or its assets may continue to collect, use and disclose your information acquired prior to such transfer or acquisition as set forth in this policy.</p>
