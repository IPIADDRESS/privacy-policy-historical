            We can be reached by e-mail at <a href="mailto:mike@kitv.com">General
            Manager</a>.</center><p></p>

            <p>This site collects no personally identifying information about
            individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by
            such individuals. In addition, we may place a "cookie"
            in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself
            does not contain any personally identifying information although
            it will enable us to relate a user's use of our sites to information
            that the user has specifically and knowingly provided to us.</p>

            <p>A user's personally identifying information may be used for
            editorial purposes and we may also use such information for marketing
            and promotional purposes and may share the information with others
            if the user has not advised us of his or her preference not to
            be included in such an exchange. Individuals always have the
            ability to stop their information being used for such purposes
            by sending an e-mail request to us at the address given above.</p>

            <p>While we will seek to require third parties with whom we have
            agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not
            bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third
            parties.</p>

            <p>Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose
            personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the
            bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can be
            collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages
            from other posters or parties.</p>

            <p>Children should ask their parents for permission before sending
            any information about themselves to us or anyone else over the
            Internet.</p>

            <p> NOTE: You must be thirteen (13) years of age or older to
            sign up for our ENEWSNOTIFIER Service. Parents or guardians may
            register on behalf of their children in order to allow them to
            receive e-mail updates from KITV4NEWS.</p>
