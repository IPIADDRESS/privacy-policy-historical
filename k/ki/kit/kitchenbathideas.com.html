<h3><a name="Children_Under_13" id="Children_Under_13"></a>Children Under 13:</h3>
<p>Meredith cares about protecting the privacy of children. We won't knowingly 
allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. 
Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any 
information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone 
numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become 
involved in your children's online experience, and to share your interest in our 
sites with your young ones. If you're under 13, please do not register with any 
of our sites or provide us with any personally identifying information (such as 
your name, your email address or your phone number). 
</p><p><a href="#top">Return 
to top</a> 
</p><h3><a name="Information_We_Collect" id="Information_We_Collect"></a>Information We Collect:</h3>
<p>The information we gather on our sites falls into two categories: (1) 
information you supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2) 
tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites. Third-party 
providers featured on, or linked to from, our sites, such as vendors of products 
and services offered through our sites, may gather information, as well.</p>
<h4>Personally Identifying Information</h4>
<div class="indent">
<p><strong>Registration Information.</strong> To use certain features on our 
sites, we ask you to register. When you register, we collect personally 
identifying information about you, including your name, mailing address, email 
address, user name and password. We may also ask for some additional 
information, such as, hobbies, age, browser type, and the like, but you're free 
to register without providing this information if you prefer. In addition, at 
various other points on our sites, we may ask you for personally identifying 
information, including when you: place an order for products, complete a survey, 
or report a problem with one of our sites. We use this information to process 
your orders, to tailor our sites to your interests and to make them more useful 
to you, and to help improve our sites generally.</p>
<p><strong>Contests and Other Promotions.</strong> From time to time, we may 
offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or advertising partners. 
If you choose to participate in one of these contests or promotions, you'll have 
to provide some information about yourself (such as your name, address, and 
email address). We may share this information with sponsors of the contest or 
other promotional partners, but we will always identify the other parties 
involved (for example, in the contest rules) and provide notice that your 
registration may be disclosed to these parties. We don't control these third 
parties' privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their 
collection and use of your information. We urge you to review their privacy 
policies and learn how they will use your information before participating. If 
you don't want us to collect the information requested in connection with a 
promotion, or to provide it to our co-sponsors or partners, please do not 
participate in the promotion.</p></div>
<h4>Tracking Information</h4>
<div class="indent">
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> To help us serve your needs better, we use 
"cookies" to store and sometimes to track user information. A cookie is a small 
amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your 
computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our sites 
to identify your computer. For example, cookies allow us to keep track of your 
user name and password (if you are a registered visitor) so you don't have to 
re-enter that information each time you visit one of our sites. We also use 
cookies to make sure you don't see the same ads repeatedly when you visit our 
sites. The help function on most browsers contains information on how to set 
your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies 
entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you may not be able to take 
advantage of various features on our sites that are available to other visitors. 
In addition, our advertising and marketing partners may use their own cookies. 
</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Advertising Services.</strong> We use the services of 
DoubleClick, a third-party advertising and email delivery company to serve and 
target advertisements that you see on the pages of our sites, to serve and 
target promotions or other marketing messages, and to send e-mails from us. 
DoubleClick also collects "clickstream data," information about your visit to 
our sites and to third-party sites that can be aggregated and used to target 
advertising on this and other sites, and used for marketing research and other 
similar purposes. This clickstream data does not include personally identifying 
information such as your name, address, email address or telephone number. 
DoubleClick uses cookies for many of the same reasons we do, and collects 
information directly from our users. We share website usage information about 
visitors to our sites who have received a targeted promotional campaign with 
DoubleClick to facilitate targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor 
information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and DoubleClick 
note some of the pages you visit on our website through the use of pixel tags 
(also called "clear gifs" or "web beacons"). If you would like to know more 
about DoubleClick information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures, 
please see the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;" target="_blank">DoubleClick website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Browser Level Information and IP Addresses.</strong> When you use our 
sites, we may also collect information about your access time and your computer 
configuration, including the type of browser software you use, the operating 
system that you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor and your 
Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your IP address is a number that is used by 
computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such 
as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell 
us who you are. Like the IP address, none of the other information described in 
this paragraph identifies you personally. We collect this information for 
purposes of aggregated reporting on site activity that we, and our advertisers, 
may use. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on 
our site, which pages or features get the most attention, and the like. The 
aggregated information helps to understand our audience and confirm the value of 
advertising on our websites.</p></div>

<h3><a name="How_your_information_will_be_used" id="How_your_information_will_be_used"></a>How Your Information Will Be 
Used:</h3>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a 
customized experience when visiting our sites and to make our sites more 
valuable to you. </p>
<div class="indent">
<p><strong>Vendors and Service Providers.</strong> To make your experience on 
our sites more useful and enjoyable, we may offer some features (such as chat 
rooms and email newsletters) in conjunction with third party providers 
("Provider Partners") that specialize in operating such services. We share with 
each of these Provider Partners such information as is necessary to provide you 
with the services we provide you in conjunction with that Provider Partner. 
Their use of this information will be subject to the terms of their respective 
privacy policies, which you can find on their websites. <em>We will not provide 
your email address to such third parties unless it's necessary to provide the 
services you have requested, or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored 
promotion.</em> </p>
<p><strong>Sites to Which We Link.</strong> We also may provide links to other 
websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, 
whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another website or 
purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our 
websites, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy 
of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or 
services. When you provide information in the course of obtaining products or 
services through our sites, use of any information you provide may be governed 
by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it 
appears that you're on one of our sites throughout the transaction. The 
provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy 
policy of any of our providers via a link either from the site's homepage or 
from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact 
the provider directly for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Shopping.</strong> When you are ready to make a purchase through one 
of our sites, we will ask you to provide us with certain information, including 
your contact details (such as your name, address, telephone and email), and your 
billing information (such as your credit card number and the date that your card 
expires). We will use the information you provide us to process your transaction 
and to contact you regarding your purchase if necessary. We will share this 
information with the relevant merchant to the extent necessary to facilitate 
your purchase (for purposes such as customer service, verification, fulfillment 
and billing purposes). We may share non-financial information with such 
merchants in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Our Other Websites.</strong> When you register for one of our sites, 
the information that you provide will be added to a centralized Meredith 
database so that you will simultaneously be registered for our other sites as 
well. We may share the information that we collect from you with other divisions 
of Meredith so that we and they can offer you products and services that we may 
believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>Postal Address Lists.</strong> If you provide us with your postal 
address, we may include that address in postal address lists that we sell or 
rent to third parties. If you would like us to stop including your postal 
address in such lists, please send us a letter (which should be addressed to 
Meredith Corporation, Opt-Out Postal, Attn: Circulation, 1716 Locust Street, Des 
Moines, Iowa 50309), requesting that we remove your postal address from these 
lists. If we receive such a letter from you, we will act as promptly as possible 
to remove your postal address from future postal address lists that we sell or 
rent to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Other Disclosures.</strong> We may occasionally release information 
about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce 
our <a href="http://www.kitchenbathideas.com/visitoragreement.html">Visitor 
Agreement</a>, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our 
sites, the public, or Meredith Corporation. As our business grows, we may buy or 
sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Meredith Corporation, 
substantially all of our assets, or one or more of our sites (or substantially 
all of its assets) is acquired by another company, information on our visitors 
would be among the transferred assets. </p>

<p><strong>Newsletters.</strong> We may offer you the opportunity to subscribe 
to email newsletters on various topics that we believe are of interest to our 
visitors. If you have opted to receive a particular newsletter, you can always 
unsubscribe later either (1) by following the 'unsubscribe' link located near 
the bottom of each newsletter, or (2) by going to <a href="https://secure.kitchenbathideas.com/common/myaccount/">My Account</a> , 
selecting "Unsubscribe" from the Newsletter options, unchecking the relevant 
boxes and pressing the "Update" button.</p>
<p><strong>Promotional Emails.</strong> If you provide us with your email 
address, from time to time we may send you emails about Meredith products, 
services and special offers (such as special Meredith magazine subscription 
offers) that we believe may be of interest to you. When you register, you will 
also be given an opportunity to tell us whether you would like to receive emails 
about products, services and special offers from third-party providers. Though 
we hope that you will find both types of promotional emails helpful, if you 
decide that you no longer wish to receive either or both types of emails, please 
go to the <a href="https://secure.kitchenbathideas.com/common/profile/optout">Email

<p>The personally identifying information we collect is stored within a database

cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that 
information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over 
the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a message you post 
to any message board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our 
sites is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to 
know your name or email address, for example, make sure not to include it in any 
message you post publicly. Please see our <a href="http://www.kitchenbathideas.com/visitoragreement.html">Visitor

<h2><a name="Your_California_Privacy_Policy" id="Your_California_Privacy_Policy"></a>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY 
RIGHTS</h2>
<p><strong>(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</strong></p>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 - also known as the "Shine the 
Light" law - California residents have a right to request certain information 
from each business they patronize regarding that business's disclosures of 
personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing 
purposes. Generally, if a business has disclosed personal information regarding 
its California customers to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the 
preceding calendar year, the business is required to provide, upon request and 
free of charge, a list of the names and addresses of all such third parties, 
together with a list of the categories of personal information that was 
disclosed.</p>
<p>The "Shine The Light" law creates an exception for businesses that adopt and 
disclose to the public (in their privacy policies) a policy of not sharing 
personal information for direct marketing purposes without offering their 
customers choices to prevent such disclosures. These businesses are not 
obligated to provide the lists described above and may respond to requests from 
California customers by notifying them of their rights to prevent disclosures of 
personal information for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost-free 
means of exercising those rights. </p>
<p>Meredith Corporation qualifies for this latter exception. As further 
explained in our <a href="#Online_Privacy_Policy">Online 
Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://secure.meredith.com/privacy/policy.html">Offline Privacy 
Policy</a>, we offer our customers choices to prevent the disclosure of their 
personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing 
purposes. To prevent such disclosures of your information, please follow the 
instructions in our "Shine The Light" Customer Notice, which is included below 
for your convenience. You can also request a copy of this Notice by emailing us 
at <a href="mailto:privacy@meredith.com">privacy@meredith.com</a>. Please note 
that we are only required to respond to one request for per California customer 
during the course of any calendar year and we reserve the right not to respond 
to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>
