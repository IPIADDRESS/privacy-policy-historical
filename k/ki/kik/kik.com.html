				<h3 class="subtitle_faq">Welcome to Kik!</h3>

						<p>We at Kik Interactive, Inc. are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store and use personal information. By using our website, <a href="http://www.kik.com" title="">www.kik.com</a> and/or by downloading Kik applications ("Kik"), you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time, but withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using Kik.</p>	

						

						<h3 class="subtitle_faq">Collection of Information</h3>

								<p>"Personal Information" is personally identifiable information such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.  We collect Personal Information from you on our website and when you download Kik, we will ask you for your name, email address and to choose a user name and password. After downloading Kik you will also be asked to verify your account via email. The Personal Information we may hold about you may therefore include, but is not limited to: your name, phone number, email address and address book information. We may also collect Personal Information from time to time through other communications with you, information downloads, product or service purchases, user support and surveys.</p>	



						<h3 class="subtitle_faq">Use of Information</h3>

								<p>We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information reasonably required to enable us to provide Kik, to respond to your inquiries and to improve our services. Except as set out in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without informing you first by updating this Privacy Policy. See further Amendment of this Policy.  We don't sell customer lists and we will endeavor to keep your email address private but you understand and acknowledge that your name and username will be public and that we may also collect statistics about the use of Kik. Aggregate statistics that do not personally identify a Kik user will be kept and used by us for various purposes including analysis and reporting of usage patterns.</p>	



						<h3 class="subtitle_faq">Disclosures &amp; Transfers</h3>

								<p>We will not disclose or transfer Personal Information to third parties, except to those select business partners who have agreed to comply with legally required privacy standards, and who will use the information only for the purposes disclosed at the time of collection or for a use consistent with that purpose.</p>

								<p>Our servers are located in Iowa and as such your Personal Information may be available to the U.S. government or its agencies under a lawful order made in that country, irrespective of the safeguards we have put in place for the protection of your Personal Information.</p> 

								<p>From time to time we may employ third parties to help us improve our website, services and Kik. These third parties may have limited access to databases of website user information or registered member information solely for the purpose of helping us to improve the website and they will not be able to use the information about our members or visitors for any other purpose.</p>

								<p>We may disclose Personal Information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the terms of use for a new service or by revising this Privacy Policy.</p>

								

						<h3 class="subtitle_faq">Important Exceptions</h3>

								<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party without your consent if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other website users, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law.</p>

								<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.</p>

								

						<h3 class="subtitle_faq">Security</h3>

										<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain your Personal Information in a secure environment and have implemented procedures designed to limit the dissemination of your Personal Information to only such persons who need access in order to carry out the stated purposes we have communicated to you.</p>

										<p>You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your Personal Information. For instance, never give out your password, and remember to log out of your account when you are finished using Kik.</p>

										

						<h3 class="subtitle_faq">Retention</h3>

										<p>We will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. If you request that your account details be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all your Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints.</p>

										

						<h3 class="subtitle_faq">Amendment of this Policy</h3>

										<p>Any non-material change (such as clarifications) to this Privacy Policy will become effective on the date the change is posted and any material changes will become effective 30 days from their posting on <a href="http://www.kik.com" title="">www.kik.com</a>. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information that we have about you and your account and will apply to information collected from the date of the posting of the revised Privacy Policy as well as to existing information held by us. The date on which the latest update was made is indicated at the bottom of this document. We recommend that you print a copy of this Privacy Policy for your reference and revisit this policy from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes. Your continued use of the website and Kik will signify your acceptance of any changes.</p>

										

						<h3 class="subtitle_faq">Access and Accuracy</h3>

										<p>We will make every reasonable effort to keep your Personal Information accurate and up-to-date, and we will provide you with mechanisms to update, correct, delete or add to your Personal Information as appropriate. As appropriate, this amended Personal Information will be transmitted to those parties to which we are permitted to disclose your information. Having accurate Personal Information about you enables us to give you the best possible service.</p>

										<p>You have the right to access the Personal Information we hold about you in order to verify the Personal Information we have collected in respect to you and to have a general account of our uses of that information. Upon receipt of your written request, we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Information although in certain limited circumstances, we may not be able to make all relevant information available to you such as where that information also pertains to another user. In such circumstances we will provide reasons for the denial to you upon request.</p>

									

							<h3 class="subtitle_faq">Contact Us</h3>

										<p>You can help by keeping us informed of any changes such as a change of address or telephone number.  If you would like to access your information, if you have any questions, comments or suggestions of if you find any errors in our information about you, please contact us at:</p>
