		    <div id="interior_main" class="legal"> 
		        The website located at www.  kik.com (the “Site”) is a  copyrighted work belonging to Kik Interactive, Inc. (“Kik”, “us”, or “we”).&nbsp;  Kik provides Kik Messenger, a smartphone to smartphone messenger  software application, and related services (collectively, the “Kik Messenger”).
				<br><br>
				We  at Kik are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes  how we collect, store, use and disclose Personal Information (defined below)  from individuals who use the Site or Kik Messenger.&nbsp; By using the Site or Kik Messenger you  consent to the processing of your Personal Information as described in this  Privacy Policy.
				<br><br>
				Privacy  Policy Version Date: June 21, 2011 
				<br><br> 
		        <h3 class="interior legal">1. General</h3>
		        1.1 Children. We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors who are under the age of 13.<br>
		        <br> 
		        1.2 Users Outside of the United States and Canada.  Your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States and/or Canada, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.<br>
		        <br> 
		        <h3 class="interior legal">2. Collection of Information</h3>
		        "Personal Information" is personally identifiable information such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address and any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information.  We collect Personal Information from you on our Site and when you use Kik Messenger as described below.<br>
		        <br>
		        2.1	Accounts.  We will ask you to provide your first and last name, email address, and phone number and to choose a user name and password when you register for an account on Kik. After downloading Kik Messenger you will also be asked to verify your account via email.  We will retain your phone number in hashed format only.<br>
		        <br>
		        2.2	Suggested Friends Feature. <br>
		        (a)	Kik Messenger includes a “you may know” feature and a “find more people on Kik” feature (collectively, the “Suggested Friends Feature”), which uses your address book contacts to help you connect with your friends by making suggestions to you and your friends.  The Suggested Friends Feature is optional.  When you sign up with Kik Messenger for the first time you are prompted to indicate whether you want to receive these “you may know” messages. If you elect to receive “you may know” messages, Kik Messenger will access and upload the phone numbers and emails addresses (but not names) from your mobile device address book to Kik’s servers, and check if those phone numbers and email addresses are registered to a Kik user.  Kik will hash the phone numbers and email addresses from your mobile device address book before uploading them to Kik’s servers. If a phone number and/or email address is registered to a Kik user, Kik will (a) inform you of the Kik user’s first and last name (as registered on Kik) and Kik username and (b) inform that Kik user of your first and last name (as registered on Kik) and Kik username, after which you can add them to your Kik Contacts.  Emails and phone numbers are not shared in this process.  After this process is complete, Kik will promptly delete your address book information from its databases.  We will retain your phone number and email address in hashed format to provide the Suggested Friends Feature.  Other users may similarly use the “you may know” feature to connect with you.<br>
		        <br>
		        (b)	You may also use the Suggested Friends Feature at a later time to rescan your address book contacts to check for new friends who have joined Kik Messenger through the “Find more people on Kik” button at the bottom of your Contacts.  If you use the “Find more people on Kik” button, Kik will scan your address book contacts and present you with people that you may know (as described in Section 2.2(a) above), after which you can add them to your Kik Contacts. Other users may similarly use the “Find more people on Kik” feature to connect with you.<br>
		        <br>
		        (c)	By indicating that you want to receive “you may know” messages or using the “Find more people on Kik” button, you hereby opt in to use the Suggested Friends Feature and consent to Kik’s use of your contact information and address book information, as described above.<br>
		        2.3	Profile Picture.  Kik Messenger includes a profile picture feature that allows you to add a profile picture to your account, which is associate with your Kik username.  If you elect to use this feature, other users will be able to see your profile picture. <br>
		        2.4	Messages.  Kik Messenger may be used to send messages between users.  If you send a message to one or more other user(s), we will retain the message sender and recipient data (but not the message) and associate it with your Kik user name.  We will delete the message promptly after the message has been delivered to the intended recipient(s).  If the message is not delivered, we may retain it on our system. <br>
		        <br>
		        2.5	Pictures.  Kik Messenger may be used to send pictures between users.  If you send a picture to one or more other user(s), we will retain that picture on your behalf, associate it with your Kik user name, and disclose that picture to the intended recipient(s). <br>
		        <br>
		        2.6	Groups.  Kik Messenger allows you to send messages and pictures to more than one user, by simply adding the user to your Kik Messenger conversation.  Once a user is added to a conversation, such user will receive all messages sent as part of that conversation.<br>
		        <br>
		        2.7	Third Party Applications.  Kik may permit certain third party applications to provide content through Kik Messenger (“Third Party Apps”).  Kik Messenger may be used to send content provided by the Third Party App between users who have the Third Party App installed on their smartphone.  For example, if you have a Third Party App installed, you may choose to share the Third Party App’s content with another user.  When you elect to do so, the Third Party App will have access to your name and the intended recipient’s name and will send a message to the intended recipient.  When the intended recipient receives the message, the recipient will be directed to the Third Party App (if the recipient has the Third Party App installed) or to the Third Party App’s download page (if the recipient does not have the Third Party App installed).  If the recipient loads the Third Party App, the recipient will have access to your name, the recipient’s name, and the Third Party App’s content sent by you. <br>
		        <br>
		        2.8	Public Profiles.  The Site and the Kik Messenger will display your first name, last name, Kik username, and profile picture.  Your public profile will be displayed at www.kik.com/[your Kik username] and within the Kik Messenger to anyone who knows your username.<br>
		        <br>
		        2.9	Other Information You Provide.  We may also collect Personal Information from time to time through other communications with you (e.g., email), information downloads, product or service purchases, user support, feedback, surveys and forums.  If you post any information to a public forum, you understand that other users will be able to see it.<br>
		        <br>
		        2.10	Information Collected Via Technology.  To make our Site and Kit Messenger more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information about you and your mobile device and such information may be associated with your Kik username.
