<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>Last updated on September 22, 2014.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes how Kik Interactive, Inc. and its subsidiaries with authorized links to this Policy, (collectively, “Kik Group”, “us”, “our” or “we”) collect, store, use and disclose Personal Information (defined below) from individuals (a) who use any of the websites located at&nbsp;<a href="http://kik.com/">www.kik.com</a>, the Kik Optimized Pages (defined below) provided by us and/or all other websites of Kik Group with authorized links to this Policy (the “Sites”), (b) who use our products or services with authorized links to this Policy, including but not limited to our Kik Messenger product, products or services provided by us that you purchase and use within our Kik Messenger product, the Kik share button, and the Apps that Kik (defined below) provided by us (the “Products”), or (c) otherwise. It does not apply to corporate or business information or employee information.</p>
<p>We at Kik Group are committed to protecting your privacy. By using our Sites and/or Products, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>2. Collection of Information</h2>
<p>2.1 Accounts.&nbsp;For some of our Products or Sites, we may require you to create an account with us. We will ask you to provide your first and last name, birth date, email address, and (optional) phone number and to choose a username and password when you register for an account on Kik. After downloading one of our Products or accessing one of our Sites, you may also be asked to verify your account via email. We will retain your phone number in hashed format only. From time to time, we may request that you provide us with certain demographic information including but not limited to gender and age information.</p>
<p>2.2 Products and Sites.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;Suggested Friends Features. Kik Messenger includes an “address book matching feature” and/or a “you may know” feature and/or a “find friends” feature (collectively, the “Suggested Friends Features”), which use your address book contacts to help you connect with your friends by making suggestions to you and your friends. The Suggested Friends Features are optional. When you sign up with Kik Messenger for the first time and whenever you log into your Kik account, you will be prompted to indicate whether you want to use the Suggested Friends Features. If you elect to use the Suggested Friends Features, Kik Messenger will periodically access and upload the phone numbers and email addresses (but&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>&nbsp;names) from your mobile device address book to Kik’s servers, and check if those phone numbers and email addresses are registered to a Kik user. If a phone number and/or email address in your address book is registered to a Kik user, Kik will inform you of the Kik user’s first and last name (as registered on Kik) and Kik username, after which you can add them to your Kik contacts by sending them a Kik message. Emails and phone numbers are not shared in this process. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consent from your address book contacts that may be required by law to allow us to access and upload the phone numbers and email addresses as described above for the purpose of generating friend suggestions. If you opt out of the Suggested Friends Features, Kik will promptly delete your address book information from its databases and Kik will not use your phone number and email address to provide the Suggested Friends Features for other users who may have your contact information in their address book. Kik will use industry standard practices to securely transmit all data used in the Suggested Friends Features. NOTE: If you opt out of the “you may know”, on older versions of Kik Messenger you may still use the “find friends” feature, but Kik will not retain your address book for the “you may know” feature. If you elect to use the Suggested Friends Features, Kik Messenger will periodically rescan your address book contacts to check for new friends who have joined Kik Messenger and present you with people that you may know (as described in Section 2.2(a)), after which you can add them to your Kik contacts by sending them a Kik message.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;Profile Picture. Kik Messenger includes a profile picture feature that allows you to optionally add a profile picture to your account. If you upload a profile picture, it will be associated with your Kik username. If you do not upload a profile picture, no photo will be associated with your Kik username. Your profile picture will be available in your public profile and to anyone you send a message to or receive a message from.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Public Profile. When you create an account with Kik, Kik will automatically create a public profile page for you. Your public profile will display your first name, last name, Kik username, and profile picture (if you have uploaded one) (your “User Profile”). Your public profile will be displayed at www.kik.com/u/[your Kik username] and at www.kik.me/[your Kik username] and within Kik Messenger to anyone who knows your exact username.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;Messages. Kik Messenger permits users to send messages between users. If you send a message to one or more other user(s), we will retain the message sender and recipient data (but not the text of the message) and associate it with your Kik username. If you “Share” content (including Kik Optimized Pages or content via the Kik share button posted on any web site) with another user using the applicable Kik Messenger interface, Kik may retain the domain and subdomain information for web sites that are shared. Subject to Section 7, we will delete the message promptly after the message has been delivered to the intended recipient(s). If the message is not delivered, we may retain it on our system.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;Other Content. In addition to plain-text messages, Kik Messenger may be used to send certain other content between users, such as pictures from your smart phone. If you send such content to one or more other user(s), we may retain that content on your behalf and associate it with your Kik username. Unlike messages, content may be stored in our systems for some period of time before being deleted (subject to Section 7).</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;Kik Optimized Pages. Mobile app developers use tools that Kik makes available to developers, including our application program interface (“API”) and Kik share button, to create Kik optimized mobile web pages ("Kik Optimized Pages") and other experiences that work within Kik Messenger. Kik Optimized Pages (referred to as “Card Features” in earlier versions of this Policy) may be offered by us or by third parties. Among other features, Kik Optimized Pages may enable users to send links to information or other content (“Kik Optimized Page Content”) to other users through Kik Messenger. For example, Sketch is a Kik Optimized Page which enables users to send links to sketches (the Content) to other users. When a user receives and opens the link to Kik Optimized Page Content from another Kik user, that link or content web address will be automatically added to the user’s browsing history list within Kik Messenger. You may remove links or addresses to Kik Optimized Page Content from your browsing history list within Kik Messenger by following the instructions on Kik Messenger. If you post Kik Optimized Page Content to a Kik Optimized Page, or send a link to such content to one or more other Kik user(s), we may retain the Kik Optimized Page Content on your behalf and associate it with your Kik username. Unlike messages, Kik Optimized Page Content may be stored in our systems for some period of time before being deleted (subject to Section 7). If a Kik Optimized Page asks you for your permission to access your user information, and you agree, the person or entity providing the web page will have access to your User Profile in the process of providing the Kik Optimized Page or Kik Optimized Page Content. Please see Section 2.2(h) for more information about Kik Optimized Pages provided by third parties.</p>
<p>(g)&nbsp;Apps that Kik. Kik Messenger integrates with certain applications that users may separately download (“Apps that Kik”) and permits users who have installed such applications to send the application’s content (“Apps that Kik Content”) to other users who have installed such applications through Kik Messenger. For the avoidance of doubt, you must separately download Apps that Kik in order to use such applications with Kik Messenger. Apps that Kik may be provided by Kik or third parties. If you download an App provided by a third party, your name, Kik username, profile photo and message identifier information may be disclosed to the third party. If you send Apps that Kik Content to one or more other user(s), we may retain that Apps that Kik Content on your behalf (e.g., it may show up in your Apps that Kik history) and associate it with your Kik username. Unlike messages, Apps that Kik Content may be stored in our systems for some period of time before being deleted (subject to Section 7). Please see Section 2.2(h) for more information about Apps that Kik provided by third parties.</p>
<p>(h)&nbsp;Third Party Sites and Products. As mentioned above, certain Kik Optimized Pages and Apps that Kik are provided by third parties (“Third Party Sites and Products”). Kik Group is not responsible for and does not control such Third Party Sites and Products. Kik Group has no obligation to review or monitor, and does not approve, endorse, or make any representations or warranties with respect to Third Party Sites and Products. You use all Third Party Sites and Products at your own risk. When you access a Third Party Site and Product, the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy policies. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any Third Party Sites and Products. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Third Party Sites and Products may have access to your username, User Profile, the username of the intended recipient(s), and the content that you send using the Third Party Site and Product.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;Groups. Kik Messenger allows you to send messages, other content, Kik Optimized Page Content, and Apps that Kik Content to more than one user, by simply adding the user to your Kik Messenger conversation. Once a user is added to a conversation, such user will receive all subsequent messages, other content, Kik Optimized Page Content, and Apps that Kik Content sent as part of that conversation.</p>
<p>2.3 Other Information You Provide.&nbsp;We may also collect Personal Information from time to time through the following:</p>
<ul><li>If/when you add a favorite within the Kik Messenger application.</li>
<li>If/when you contact us via email (with feedback, for support, or otherwise), we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply.</li>
<li>If/when you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information.</li>
<li>If/when you post messages on our message boards, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.</li>

<li>If/when you order Products from us, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information and shipping information.</li>
</ul><p>2.4 Information Collected Via Technology.&nbsp;We or our third party service providers collect information about you, your computer, and/or your mobile device automatically through various technologies as described below (“Collection Technologies”) and such information may be associated with your Kik username, your phone and/or your IP address. Such information may include: what Products you downloaded and Sites you accessed; pages or Third Party Sites and Products you viewed or used; time spent on pages; terms searched; links clicked; how long it takes for pages to load; what type of device you have; language preference; device uptime and network status; a generated device id internal to Kik Messenger; if you have an iPhone or a Windows Phone, your push tokens; the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the connection for each authentication request; the date/time stamp for various Kik Messenger activities; the use of Kik Optimized Pages and the sharing of content through the Products; and other similar diagnostic logs. We may also collect information on an anonymous basis regarding how you use various Kik Messenger features. We may also use Cookies, beacons, image tags and similar technologies to gather information about you, such as your computer’s or mobile device’s location, brand of mobile device, etc. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our Sites may not work properly. This type of information is collected in part to make the Sites and the Products more useful to you and to tailor your experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. Like most companies, we automatically gather the information described above and store it in log files each time you visit our Sites or use our Products. When you use the web browser feature provided through the Kik Messenger, third party websites may also collect information from you using Collection Technologies, but this Policy does not cover such collection or any resulting use or disclosure.</p>
<p>2.5 Kik Messenger Search Engine Feature.&nbsp;Along with other information collected via the Collection Technologies, when you use a search engine feature of Kik Messenger, Kik may collect search queries submitted through the Kik Messenger search engine and retain them in anonymous form.</p>
<p>2.6 Kik Messenger Web Browser Feature.&nbsp;Along with the other information collected via the Collection Technologies, when you use the web browser feature of Kik Messenger to visit web pages, Kik may collect the web addresses of the sites you visit (i.e. your browsing history).</p>
<p>2.7 Kik Share Button.&nbsp;Along with the other information collected via the Collection Technologies, when you use the Kik share button hosted on third party websites to transmit links or other content to other Kik users, Kik may collect the web addresses and content that you elect to send using the share button. We may also collect information about how many times you use the Kik share button and from where.</p>
<p>2.8 Crash Analytics.&nbsp;We may analyze errors or malfunctions in the Kik Messenger application for the purpose of providing Sites and Products, resolving bugs and improving performance. This analysis may result in limited log information (which may include some browsing data and small amounts of personally identifiable information) being collected by us.</p>
<p>2.9 Information Collected from You About Others.&nbsp;If you decide to invite a third party to create an account with us, you should only do so if you think that third party would want to be contacted by us. If you extend an invitation, we will collect your and the third party’s names and email addresses in order to send an email and follow up with the third party. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consent from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to collect the third party’s name and email address as described above. You or the third party may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@kik.com">support@kik.com<script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">
/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t="currentScript"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName("script"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute("cf-hash"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute("data-cfemail");if(a){for(e="",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */</script></a> to request removal of this information from our database.</p>
<p>2.10 Information Collected from Third Party Companies.&nbsp;We may receive information about you from third parties. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Sites and our Products, for a variety of purposes, including to verify other information about you and to improve the Products we provide. We may use anonymous information to enhance the advertising we provide to you.</p>
<p>2.11 Information Transmitted to Social Networking Sites.&nbsp;Some of our Products will enable you to post content to social networking sites (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). If you choose to do this, we will provide your information to such social networking sites in accordance with your elections. Such site’s use of your information is not governed by this privacy policy. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your use of those sites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such social networking sites. Kik Group will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such sites; (ii) the content, products, or services on or availability of such sites; or (iii) your use of any such third party social networking sites.</p>
<p>2.12 Advertising and Analytics Partners and Tracking Choices.&nbsp;We may share anonymous data with advertising networks, analytics providers (including Google Analytics), and other third parties (“Advertising Partners”) to analyze Site and Product usage by our users and develop and deliver targeted advertising and promotional content in our Sites and Products and on the websites of third parties. We may also allow our Advertising Partners to collect this type of information within our Sites and Products, and they may share such information, as well as other information they collect through other third party websites, products and services, with us and third parties. Our Advertising Partners may collect this information through the use of their Collection Technologies (e.g., their cookies or beacons), or by requesting this information directly from you (e.g. via Promoted Chats). The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery, and send you promotional messages, to personalize your user experience by increasing the probability that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake analytics (i.e., to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience). We do not control our Advertising Partners or their Collection Technologies or privacy practices, and this Policy does not govern their use of information collected from you using their Collection Technologies or Promoted Chats. To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising for participating ad networks, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Network Advertising Initiative</span></a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Digital Advertising Alliance</span></a>.

<h2>4. Disclosures &amp; Transfers</h2>
<p>In addition to the disclosures described in Section 2, we may additionally disclose your information as follows:</p>
<p>4.1&nbsp;Our servers and our service providers may be located in the United States, Canada or other countries and, as such, your Personal Information may be available to the U.S., Canadian or other government or its agencies under a lawful order made in the applicable country (and such information may be further made available by that country to other countries), irrespective of the safeguards we have put in place for the protection of your Personal Information.</p>
<p>4.2&nbsp;From time to time we may employ third parties to help operate our business, the Sites or our Products. Examples of such service providers include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services and/or content for analyzing data, including user content, research services, advertising and marketing assistance, payment processing (including credit card payments), and customer service. Access to your Personal Information by each of these service providers is limited to the information reasonably necessary to perform its limited function and these service providers may only use your Personal Information to provide services on our behalf.</p>
<p>4.3&nbsp;If you download an App that Kiks or access or use a Kik Optimized Page provided by a third party, your User Profile and message identifier information may be disclosed to the third party. We may disclose Personal Information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in a separate consent for a new product or service.</p>
<p>4.4&nbsp;If you decide to invite another user of Kik Messenger to use or access a Kik Optimized Page, you should only do so if you have the consent of that user to allow his or her Kik username and profile information (last name, first name, profile photo) to be shared with the provider of the Kik Optimized Page for the purposes disclosed in the privacy policy applicable to the Kik Optimized Page. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consent from the users that you invite that may be required by law to allow for this collection, use and disclosure of this information. If another user of Kik Messenger invites you to use a Kik Optimized Page, you consent to us sharing your User Profile with the provider of the Kik Optimized Page.</p>
<p>4.5&nbsp;We may, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information to a third party without your consent: (a) if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users of our Products or Sites, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities; (b) in connection with any legal investigation; (c) when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law, such as when responding to subpoenas, warrants, production orders, or similar orders issued under Canadian laws or by a court of competent jurisdiction served on the Kik Group; and/or (d) if we believe in good faith that there is an emergency involving loss of security or serious injury to any person.</p>
<p>4.6&nbsp;We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate reorganization, a merger or acquisition with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information. In the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Policy.</p>

<p>5.1&nbsp;When you click on a link to any other website maintained by anyone other than us, including through your use of the browser feature integrated into Kik Messenger and use of Kik Optimized Pages developed by third parties, you will leave our Site and go to another site and another entity may collect Personal Information or anonymous information from you. Kik Optimized Pages may receive information from your Kik account at your election. Such site’s collection, use and disclosure of your information is not governed by this privacy policy. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your use of those sites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such sites. Kik Group will not be responsible or liable for your use of any such sites and such third party provider’s use, collection, and disclosure of your information.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kik Group has no obligation to review or monitor, and does not approve, endorse, or make any representations or warranties with respect to third party sites. You use all third party sites at your own risk. When you access or use third party sites, the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy policies. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before accessing or using any third party sites and Products. This includes making your own assessment about whether “block” or “ignore” features are made available through third party sites.</span></p>
<p>5.2&nbsp;Third party advertisers can create Kik accounts to communicate with Kik users within Kik Messenger (“Promoted Chats”). Promoted Chats enable advertisers to send promotional and other messages to any Kik user who has elected to communicate with the advertiser through Kik Messenger. You may unsubscribe from Promoted Chats at any time by following the instructions on Kik Messenger to block messages from the advertiser’s user profile. Kik Group does not approve, endorse or make any representations or warranties with respect to Promoted Chats. To track the performance and success of Promoted Chats and to improve the service, Kik may utilize aggregate level tracking of Promoted Chats. For example, Kik may measure how many users who elect to participate in Promoted Chats with a particular advertiser then block messages from that advertiser. Kik may also prepare reports or provide other services to advertisers in respect of their Promoted Chats.</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>6.1&nbsp;The security of your Personal Information is important to us.
