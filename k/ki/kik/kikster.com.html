able to order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express 
an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, 
or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types 
of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these 
pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax 
number, credit card information, and information about your interests 
in and use of various products, programs, and services.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In addition, you can submit 
information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's 
name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if 
you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, 
you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally 
identifiable information that may be collected about other people at 
these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and 
telephone number.  At some of our Web sites, you may be able to 
submit photos, video, or other forms of electronic data in addition 
to the foregoing.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At certain parts of some of 
our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally 
identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and 
services, or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings. 
We also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when 
you visit many of our Web pages such as the type of browser you are 
using the type of operating system you are using, and the domain name 
of your Internet service provider.</font></p>

<a name="howweuse"></a>
<p><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><b>How We Use The Information</b></font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We use the information you 
provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, 
and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and 
to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may 
be of interest to you.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We use this information to 
communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of 
our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to 
fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you 
about your account with us.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We use the information that 
you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. 
From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, 
programs, or services to them.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The information we collect 
in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide 
an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation 
in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer 
you products, programs, or services.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If you choose to submit content 
for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors" or a photograph 
or video), we may publish your screen name and other information you 
have provided to us.  Please refer to our Content Submission terms by 
clicking here.  We use the non-personally identifiable information 
that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to 
enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this 
information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer 
you products, programs, or services.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We may disclose personally 
identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, 
in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such 
information in response to a law enforcement agency's request or where 
we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding 
illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential 
threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms 
of use, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer 
information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Although we take appropriate 
measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, 
we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we 
collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with 
this Privacy Policy.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At some places on our site, 
we may ask your permission to disclose personally identifiable information 
about you to companies whose practices are not covered by this Privacy 
Policy (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory 
databases and non-profit organizations) that want to market products 
or services to you. If at some point you grant us permission to transfer 
your information for these purposes and later decide that you no longer 
want us to do so, simply send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@kikster.com" target="_blank">privacy@kikster.com</a> and 
we will edit your preferences accordingly.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We may, on occasion, combine 
information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability 
to market to you those products or services that may be of interest 
to you. When registering with our site, we provide you with an opportunity 
to express your preferences with respect to receiving details about 
other products and services from us and about products and services 
from selected third parties. If you ever decide in the future that you 
would like to update these preferences, you may do so by sending us 
an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@kikster.com" target="_blank">privacy@kikster.com</a> and we will edit your preferences accordingly. </font></p>

by Third Party Sites and Sponsors</b></font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some of our sites contain links

Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy policies, as we have 
no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these 
third parties.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We sometimes may offer content 
(e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or 
co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, 
the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that 
visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We 
have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The

Information</b></font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We send "cookies" 
to your computer primarily to enhance your online experience. "Cookies" 
are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your 
personal preferences as well as technical information (including click 
through and click stream data). Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., 
they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., 
they last only until you close your browser). We may also use "Web 
beacons" that monitor your use of our sites. Web beacons (or Web 
bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering 
a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data, 
such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded 
the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource 
Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page 
containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched 
the Web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer 
previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML 
capable e-mail, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened 
our e-mail.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If you choose to furnish the 
site with personally identifiable information, this information can 
be stored in or linked to other data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">By accepting this Privacy Policy, 
you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described 
herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from 
any other Web site. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display 
HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some 
Web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser 
for more information. However, certain areas of our sites can only be 
accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should 
be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you 
from accessing some of our content.</font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We use third-party advertising 
companies and networks to serve ads. These third-party ad network providers 
may use web beacons and cookies to help present, better target, and 
measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, using non-personally 
identifiable data (such as sites visited and browser type) gathered 
over time and across their networks of Web pages to determine or predict 
the characteristics and preferences of their audience. </font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><b>Children's Privacy</b></font></p> 
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Visitors to this site may participate 
in many activities without providing any personally identifiable information. 
However, if a user wants to participate in certain of our interactive 
features, we ask the user to register and provide us with the following 
information: the user's e-mail address and age information. When the 
person who registers indicates that he or she is under 13, we will either 
collect no personally identifiable information from that individual 
or inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required or 
we will collect the e-mail address of the user's parent in addition 
to the user's e-mail address. We use the parent's e-mail address to 
seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her 
child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her 
child from a newsletter or other similar activity. If a user is under 
13, we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity 
on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to 
participate in the activity. We do not share children's information 
with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy. If you 
would like to review any personally identifiable information that we 
have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, 
and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's 
information or if you have questions about these information practices, 
you may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kikster.com" target="_blank">privacy@kikster.com</a>.</font></p>
