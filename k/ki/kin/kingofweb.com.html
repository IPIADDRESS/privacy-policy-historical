<p><b>Last Updated: April 30, 2013</b></p>

<p>Welcome to Creator Republic! This Privacy Policy ("<b>Policy</b>") explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Creator Republic, Inc. and our subsidiaries and affiliated companies ("<b>Creator Republic</b>," "<b>we</b>," or "<b>us</b>") when you access and use <a href="http://www.creatorrepublic.com">www.creatorrepublic.com</a>, <a href="http://www.creatorrepublicnetwork.com">www.creatorrepublicnetwork.com</a> and any of our other websites, online and mobile applications, features and services (collectively, the "<b>Services</b>").</p>

<p><b>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</b></p>

<p>We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Services. For example, we
collect information you provide to us when you register for an account, create or update your
profile, participate in any interactive features of the Services, make a purchase, participate in a
contest or promotion, communicate with us through third party social media channels, request
customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The information we collect may include
your name, email address, user name, display name, postal address, photos, videos, other contact
or demographic information and any other information you choose to provide.</p>

<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we
collect on our Services. For example, if you log in to our Services via Facebook Connect, we
collect information about you as permitted by the Facebook Connect terms, including your
name, profile picture, email address, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends and any other
information you make publicly available.</p>

<p>In addition, when you visit our Services, some information is automatically collected, including:</p>

<ul>

  Internet Protocol ("<b>IP</b>") address, access times, browser type and language, and the
  website you visited before navigating to our Services.</li>
  <li><b>Device Information:</b> We collect information about the computer or mobile device you
  use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version,
  unique device identifiers and mobile network information.</li>
  <li><b>Information Collected by Cookies and other Tracking Technologies:</b> We use various
  technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your
  computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in
  device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas
  and features of our Services are popular and count visits. In addition, when you view
  a video on our Services, we may also set a "flash cookie" on your computer or device.
  We may also collect information using Web beacons (also known as "gifs," "pixel tags"
  and "tracking pixels"). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on our
  Services or in our emails. Web beacons are used to monitor user activity, deliver cookies,
  count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been
  opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them,
  please see "Your Information Choices and Changes" below.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>USE OF INFORMATION</b></p>

<p>We use information collected through our Services for purposes described in this Policy or
disclosed to you on our Services. For example, we may use your information to:</p>

        <li>link or combine with other information we get from third parties to help understand your
        needs and provide you with better service.</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

<p><b>SHARING OF INFORMATION</b></p>

<p>Our Services are generally designed to encourage open communication and facilitate the sharing
of information and opinions. However, we will not share your personal information with third
parties other than as follows:</p>

<p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>when you give us your consent, including if we notify you on our Services that the
    information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such
    information;</li>
    <li>when you upload videos and other content to our Services, such content may be publicly
    viewable across the Internet (including in online search results) along with your image,
    display name, and any additional information you provide in connection with such
    content;</li>

    <li>with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who are working on our
    behalf and need access to your information to carry out their work for us;</li>
    <li>if you enter a contest that is sponsored by a third party, we may share your name
    and email address with the third party sponsor for various purposes, including prize
    fulfillment;</li>
    <li>if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law,
    regulation, legal process or governmental request; to enforce our agreements, policies and
    terms of use; to protect the security and integrity of our Services; and to protect King of
    the Web, our users or any other person from harm or illegal activities; and</li>
    <li>in connection with any, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets,
    financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
  </ul>
<p></p>

<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.</p>

<p><b>SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES</b></p>
<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the
Facebook "Like" button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media,
and vice versa. The use of such features enable the sharing of information with your friends or
the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing
feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing
in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that
provide these features.</p>

on our Services to collect non-personal information about your use of the Services. The data
collected typically includes information such as your IP address, the browser you use to visit
