							<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
							<p></p><p>This privacy policy is published by Kingston Communications (Hull) plc ("<strong>Kingston</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>").

<h2><a name="1"></a>1. OUR APPROACH</h2>
<p>Kingston takes the privacy of its users seriously. Generally, you can browse through our Website without giving us any information about yourself (including your email address). When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.</p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy for this Website, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.</p>
<h2><a name="2"></a>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2>
<p>We collect personal information (such as your name, email address and any other details you provide to us that identifies you as an individual) from you when you submit a request for information or when you submit your details for any other reason. Personal information will only be collected with your consent.</p>
<p>When you browse our Website, we may also log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our Website you visit and how long you spend here. We do not link your IP address to any other personal information that you send to us.

<h2><a name="3"></a>3. USE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>We (and other Kingston group companies) will use your information for several general purposes including: fulfilling any requests for information or services placed by you, processing any other transactions authorised by you, personalising your experience on our Website, keeping you up to date with news about Kingston, our products and services, and providing other information to you which we think you may find of interest.
