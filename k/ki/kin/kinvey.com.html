      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>www.kinvey.com </strong>(the “<strong>Site</strong>”), a website operated by Kinvey, Inc.
        (“<strong>Kinvey</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, or “<strong>our</strong>”). We know you are
        concerned about privacy, so we developed this privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) to explain how we
        collect, use, and disclose information from you, our user (“<strong>you</strong>” or “ <strong>your</strong>”). We
        offer the first backend as a service that makes it ridiculously easy for developers to setup, use and operate a cloud
        backend
        for their mobile apps (“<strong>Apps</strong>”), and a number of related services (collectively, the
        “<strong>Services</strong>”). Read on and we will tell
        you how this all works.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy will apply whether you are a “<strong>Visitor</strong>” (which means that you simply browse the
        Site), or a “<strong>Developer</strong>
        ” (which means you have registered with us and established an Account). Visitors and Developers are individually
        referred to as a “<strong>User</strong>,”
        and collectively, as “<strong>Users”</strong>. This Privacy Policy also applies to information collected through Apps
        from end users of those Apps (“ <strong>End Users</strong>”), as described in more detail below.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase “<strong>Personal Information</strong>”, we
        mean contact information (i.e.,
        name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended
        to be used to personally identify an
        individual, and information associated with the foregoing. When we use the phrase “<strong>Anonymous
        Information</strong>”, we mean information that is not
        associated with or linked to Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact
        with, individual persons.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong></strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE
          TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU
          EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOUR PERSONAL
          INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN
          THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING
          PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY
          BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <u></u>
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Personal Information and End User Information</u>
      </p>

      <p>
        We receive and store information you voluntarily provide to us (either through the Site or in some other way). When
        you register with us, we require you to
        provide certain Personal Information, such as your name, mailing address, phone number and email address, as well as
        information related to the company
        with which you are affiliated. You may choose as part of certain Services to provide additional Personal Information.
        For example, if you are a Developer
        creating your public profile on the Site (“<strong>Profile</strong>”), you may choose to provide your photograph.
      </p>

      <p>
        One type of Personal Information we will collect when you purchase Services as a Developer is “<strong>Payment
        Information</strong>”, which means the
        information necessary to process your order. Payment Information may include the following: (i) your name as it
        appears on the credit card; (ii) the credit
        card type (VISA, MasterCard, American Express or any other issuer accepted by us); (iii) a valid credit card number;
        (iv) the date of expiration of your
        credit card; (v) your billing address; and (vi) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card. If you
        authorize recurring charges for Fees, we
        will store your Payment Information. However, we may offer alternative means of paying for orders such as PayPal,
        through which Kinvey will not collect any
        Payment Information from you.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, we collect Personal Information when you provide it through your participation in discussion forums. Any
        information that you post in our
        discussion forums, including your Personal Information, may be disclosed and available to all Users of that webpage
        and is no longer private. Other Users
        of the Site may use that information at their discretion, including to contact you. Please be thoughtful about what
        you post and make publicly available
        through our discussion forums and reviews. When you communicate with us through our Site or by sending us an email, we
        may collect and store any
        information that is contained in your communications with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        We collect Third Party API Access Protocols as provided in the Section headed Our Relationship with Social Networking
        Sites and Third Party Data Providers.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, if a Developer collects and submits to us information of End Users, either through an App or otherwise,
        we may receive and store such
        information (“<strong>End User Information</strong>”). End User Information collected through Apps may include, but is
        not limited to, the following, which
        may be Personal Information of such End Users:
      </p>

      <p>
        · Information about End Users, including name, address, gender, age, marital status, photograph, in-App purchase
        history, survey responses, and
        preferences.
      </p>

      <p>
        · Information about a mobile device, including universally unique ID (“<strong>UUID</strong>”), platform type and
        version (iOS v4, Android, etc.), carrier
        and country location, hardware and processor information (storage, chip speed, camera resolution, NFC enabled, and
        network type (WiFi, 2G, 3G, 4G).
      </p>

      <p>
        · Sensory and other information collected through a mobile device, including accelerometer data, lock phone on/off,
        power on/off, airplane mode on/off,
        number of SMS/MMS messages, number of calls and duration, camera usage, speaker usage, Bluetooth usage, NFC usage, and
        GPS location data
      </p>

      <p>
        · Information about App usage, including user App retention data, session length, and session interval.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Anonymous Information</u>
      </p>

      <p>
        As you use our Site or Service, we may also collect certain information, including Internet protocol address, browser
        type, domain names, and access times
        from you and End User devices accessing the Services through your Apps, as well as any other anonymous End User
        Information of submitted through your Apps.
        We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the
        date and time of your use of the
        Service. An “<strong>Internet protocol address</strong>” or “<strong>IP address</strong>” is a number that is
        automatically assigned to your computer by
        your Internet access provider when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser
        session to browser session; but if you
        use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP
        addresses solely in conjunction with session
        cookies to analyze our web page flow. “<strong>Cookies</strong>” are small pieces of information that a web site sends
        to your computer’s hard drive while
        you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and
        persistent Cookies (which stay on your
        computer until you delete them). Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We work with online partners and advertisers to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications and
        offer third party products and
        services to you. To do this, we or our partners or advertisers may use web beacons, clear GIFs and Cookies on this
        Site. The information collected in this
        way helps us learn things like what kinds of Users our Site attracts, which of our products most interest our Users,
        and what kinds of offers our Users
        like to see.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites and Third Party Data Providers</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We have created and may offer you interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking websites such as
        Facebook and Twitter (“ <strong>SN Sites</strong>”) through our Site. We will work with the SN Site’s application
        protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way
        that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SN Site on your behalf. In order to provide this
        authorization, you will not provide us with
        your user ID or password to the SN Site, but you will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site. Once
        authorized by you, the SN Site will
        provide us a token that allows the SN Site to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account
        information or to post information. You
        will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your
        account settings on the applicable SN
        Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide you.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to accessing your SN Site accounts through Developer APIs, we may also offer interfaces that allow
        Developers to connect with APIs for SN Sites
        as well as other third party data providers in a manner that allows a Developer to retrieve data from such third
        parties for inclusion in a Developer’s
        App, for example Facebook or Yahoo! Maps (collectively, “Third Party Data Providers”). We may connect Apps to such
        APIs using the token method discussed
        above or we may require that a Developer provide us the applicable API key, user name, password or other method of
        authentication (the “ <strong>Third Party API Access Protocols</strong>”). The Third Party API Access Protocols will
        be disclosed and used in the same manner as Personal
        Information, with the understanding that they will not be used to market any products or services.

      <p>
        <strong>HOW WE USE INFORMATION</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <u></u>
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Personal Information and End User Information </u>
      </p>

      <p>
        We will use Personal Information, including End User Information to:
      </p>

      <p>
        · Administer Accounts;
      </p>

      <p>
        · Process your payments, provide the Services and customer support;
      </p>

      <p>
        · Tailor the features of the Site or Services to you;
      </p>

      <p>
        · Respond to requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;
      </p>

      <p>
        · Market our Services and products to our Users and those of third parties we believe may be of interest to our Users,
        including through the serving of
        targeted advertisements, though we will not disclose your Personal Information in doing so. For example, we allow
        advertisers to choose the characteristics
        of Users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have
        collected to select the appropriate
        audience for those advertisements. For example, if you tend to view and automobile-related content, we might use that
        interest to show you ads for
        automobiles (and to tell ad networks to serve those ads), but we do not tell any automobile maker who you are, though
        the dealer or manufacturer may learn
        that you possess certain characteristics based on the fact that you received the advertisement. We may do this on the
        site, in the Apps and on other
        websites on the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        · Market services and products to your End Users, in a manner similar to the method used for Users described above,
        but only if you choose to add
        advertising capabilities to your App;
      </p>

      <p>
        · Improve the quality of the Site and the Services;
      </p>

      <p>
        · Verify your compliance with your obligations in our Terms of Use and/or other agreements you may have executed with
        us;
      </p>

      <p>
        · Communicate with Users about the Site and the Services, and
      </p>

      <p>
        · Showcase the Personal Information you include in your Profile, if you elect to create one, to other Users.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also use Personal Information to contact you and provide you with information that may be useful or interesting to
        you, including newsletters regarding
        changes and upgrades to the Services as well as promotional e-mails, and to allow certain other entities to do the
        same. By using the Site, you agree to
        receive this information from us and certain other entities. If you do not want to receive these communications, you
        can always opt out of communications
        by following the instructions provides in the email or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:sales@kinvey.com">sales@kinvey.com</a>.
        We may, however, send
        certain administrative emails which pertain to the Site and Services on a regular basis that you may not opt-out of.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may also use Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information that makes the
        information personally identifiable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Anonymous Information</u>
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally, we use Anonymous Information in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of our
        Services. We may, through our use of Cookies,
        keep you logged into the Site during each session. We may also use Anonymous Information to improve our internal
        operations, surveys and software, and
        customize the content and layout of the Site and/or Service. We may also, with your consent, combine Anonymous
        Information with your Personal Information.
        We reserve the right to use Anonymous Information without restriction.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        While it probably goes without saying, just to avoid any possible confusion, we go out of our way to say that End User
        Information is provided by
        Developers to Kinvey and we use and disclose the End User Information as provided in this Privacy Policy. Developers
        have a right to access, use and
        disclose the End User Information collected by the Developer’s App in conformance with the privacy statement displayed
        in the applicable App. Kinvey is not
        responsible for the Developer’s privacy statement or the Developer’s compliance with its privacy statement.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may disclose certain Personal Information, including End User Information:
      </p>

      <p>
        · To third party vendors who help us provide the Services or the Site, including vendors that process payments, or who
        provide or market additional goods
        and services, in which case we will require such vendors to use such information in accordance with their privacy
        policies posted on their websites; <a name="OLE_LINK1"></a><a name="OLE_LINK2"></a>
      </p>

      <p>
        · To third parties to whom you ask us to send Personal Information, including where a Developer chooses to integrate a
        third party’s services or content
        into an App;
      </p>

      <p>
        · To other Users, if you create a public Profile.
      </p>

      <p>
        · To a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively,
        “<strong>Affiliates</strong>”), in the
        event we have such Affiliates in the future, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy
        Policy;
      </p>

      <p>
        · To a company that merges with us, acquires us, or purchases our assets, in which case such company may continue to
        process your Personal Information as
        set forth in this Privacy Policy; or
      </p>
