	<h2>KINGOLOTTO PRIVACY POLICY</h2><p>
The <a href="http://www.kingolotto.com/">www.kingolotto.com</a> website is owned and operated by&nbsp;
MEDIASTAY North America, Inc.<br>
350 Sansome Street, Ste 740 San Francisco, CA 94104  (“Mediastay”).  <br>
This privacy policy  describes how, on the <a href="http://www.kingolotto.com/">www.kingolotto.com</a> website (“Website”),  Mediastay collects, uses and shares Personally Identifiable Information and  Non-Personally Identifiable Information obtained from and about individuals who  visit the Website. Mediastay respects the privacy of persons who choose to  visit the Website and is committed to making the Website a safe and secure  environment.   
</p>
<h3>I. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
</h3>
<p>
<strong>A. Personally Identifiable Information.</strong>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Personally Identifiable        Information (“PII”) is information that identifies you or can be used to        identify or contact you which is collected via the Website. To register        with the Website (and establish a Game Account, which is required to play        the KINGOLOTTO Game and otherwise use the Website), the only PII that        must be provided is one's first and last name and e-mail address; and, a        unique password must be created. Additionally, if a registered individual        wins certain prizes in an installment of the KINGOLOTTO Game and/or        he/she wishes to redeem accrued KingoPoints for awards via the        KingoPoints Awards area, he/she will also be required to provide        his/her residential address and telephone number. Note also that for the        redemption of KingoPoints for awards, sales and shipping records will be        generated and maintained by Mediastay. Mediastay does not <strong><u>require</u></strong> more PII than is        reasonably necessary to participate in particular activities on the        Website or to use the Website effectively.  But, to use the Website and play the        KINGOLOTTO Game, a person must register (and establish a Game        Account) and provide his/her first and last name and e-mail address as        well as create a password.</li><br>
	<li><strong><u>Optional Information</u></strong>.  In certain areas and/or for certain        activities on the Website, registered individuals may be asked for        additional personal or demographic information, some of which may be        PII.  Provision of such additional        information is completely optional and your decision whether (or not) to        provide such information will <strong><u>NOT </u></strong>affect your ability to participate in the KINGOLOTTO Game or        otherwise use the Website (with the possible exception of usage of the        designated area and/or participation in the specified activity on the        Website related to the collection of such Optional Information).</li><br>
	<li><strong><u>THIS WEBSITE IS INTENDED FOR USE ONLY BY PERSONS 18 AND        OVER.  MEDIASTAY WILL NOT KNOWINGLY        REQUEST PII FROM PERSONS WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN 18.<br>
	<br>
	</u></strong></li>
	<li>The Website is intended for use        exclusively by U.S.        citizens. Our computer systems are based in Europe. <strong><u>Persons who are not U.S.        citizens should NOT disclose any PII on the Website.<br>
	<br>
	</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<ol>
</ol>
<strong>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Non-Personally Identifiable        Information (“Non-PII”) is information that, by itself, <strong><u>CANNOT</u></strong> be used to identify        or contact you. Examples of Non-PII are your date of birth, title,        zipcode, certain responses to surveys and questionnaires (e.g., how often        you visit the supermarket), your IP address, browser types, domain names,        or other anonymous statistical data involving use of the Website.  Certain Non-PII (specifically, date of        birth, gender and zipcode) is required as part of the registration        process in order to establish a Game Account.  The provision of other non-PII is        optional (see Clause IA §2).</li><br>
	<li>Non-PII will also be collected <strong><u>PASSIVELY, </u></strong>via cookies or        web beacons.  <strong><u>Cookies</u></strong> are files or pieces of information that are        stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. A cookie records        your preferences in using the <a href="http://www.kingolotto.com/">www.kingolotto.com</a> Website to        facilitate your use of the Website. Mediastay may use cookies to track        unique visitors to the Website; to track who has used certain areas of        the Website, and the path used to get to those areas; to track Non-PII        about users of the Website, the browser used, and to allow Mediastay to        create data reports for internal use and for use by third parties.  Mediastay will also use cookies to        collect or otherwise record Non-PII on the Website which will be combined        with PII provided by registered individuals to create profiles of such        individuals (see Clause IIC).  <br>
	<strong>YOUR COMPUTER MUST BE CONFIGURED TO        ACCEPT COOKIES IN ORDER FOR YOU TO REGISTER WITH THE WEBSITE, ESTABLISH A        GAME ACCOUNT AND USE THE WEBSITE.         IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE YOUR COMPTUER ACCEPT COOKIES, DO NOT        USE THE WEBSITE. If you are using a public access computer that is        configured not to accept cookies, you will NOT be able to register with        the Website, establish a Game Account or use the Website.</strong> <strong><u>Web beacons </u></strong>(also known as        clear GIFs or action tags) are a web technology, used in conjunction with        cookies, which enable Mediastay to track Website usage information, such        as the number of times a given web page has been viewed. Web beacons are        invisible to you and (unlike cookies) are not placed on your computer.        Web beacons, which can be “read” by cookies, may be embedded in certain        areas of the Website, including advertisements on the Website. Mediastay        may use web beacons for tracking Website access and usage as well as to        log Non-PII provided by users, so that Mediastay may create internal and        external reports regarding Website usage. Mediastay does not use web        beacons to collect or otherwise record any type of PII provided by or        about any Website visitor. </li>
</ol>
<h3>II. HOW PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE &amp; NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE  INFORMATION ARE USED
</h3>
<p>
<strong>A. PII. </strong><br>
Mediastay may use  PII collected in conjunction with Website registration, participation in an  installment of the KINGOLOTTO Game, collection and redemption of KingoPoints in  the KingoPoints Awards area or other activities as follows: 
</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li> 
	<ul>
		<li>To register you for the Website  and establish your Game Account, including transmission of an e-mail message to  confirm the validity of the e-mail address provided by you at time of  registration.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<ul>
		<li>To allow you to participate in  an installment of the KINGOLOTTO Game (including sending you a confirmation  e-mail message with all Game grids played by you on a single day of the Game;  after the Draw for an installment of the KINGOLOTTO Game has been conducted for  a given day, sending you an e-mail message with the winning</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>numbers for that  day's Draw; and in the event that you are a potential prize winner, sending you  an e-mail message advising you of such status) as well as to otherwise verify  your compliance with the Official Rules for such installment of the KINGOLOTTO  Game.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<ul>
		<li>To allow you to participate in  the Kingolotto Awards area (including collection of your residential address  and telephone number in conjunction with fulfillment of requests to redeem  KingoPoints for awards) as well as to verify your compliance with the Terms  &amp; Conditions of the KingoPoints Awards area.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>To enable your use of certain  areas of the Website and your participation in other activities on the Website  (e.g., surveys and questionnaires) and to verify your compliance with the applicable  requirements to use such areas and/or to participate in such activities.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>To inform you, via e-mail  message, of upcoming installments of the KINGOLOTTO Game, special prizes in the  current installment of the Game, other games, offers and/or goods/services from  Mediastay that may be of interest to you.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>To personalize and enhance the  Website and your experience in using the Website as well as to send you  personalized information about the Website via e-mail.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>For internal research reports  to be used with the objective of improving the Website.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>To contact you for feedback  regarding Mediastay, its advertisers or business partners.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>To ensure that Mediastay fully  complies with all applicable laws. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
PII which you disclose <strong><u>WILL </u></strong>be shared with third parties who may administer the Website (and/or a  given activity on the Website) for Mediastay (and/or Mediastay's own personnel)  as well as shipping companies that may deliver awards (from the KingoPoints  Awards area) and/or prizes (from an installment of the KINGOLOTTO  Game).  Such third parties (and/or  Mediastay personnel, as appropriate) will only receive the PII that is  absolutely necessary for the third party (and/or Mediastay personnel) to be  able to fully perform its assigned function; and, the third parties (and/or  Mediastay personnel) will be contractually bound to only use the PII for  authorized purposes only as well as to maintain its confidentiality. Mediastay  will inform you when the PII is being collected that such collection is  required to participate in the indicated activity or to use a certain,  designated area of the Website. 
</p>
<p>
Should you respond to a particular offer from one of Mediastay's  advertisers or business partners, Mediastay may also use your PII to provide a  report to such advertiser/business partner that identifies who responded to a  particular offer. And, if you accept an advertiser/business partner offer,  Mediastay may provide the advertiser/business partner with the PII that is  necessary for the advertiser/business partner to fulfill that offer.  However, should one of Mediastay's  advertisers or business partners request your PII for a <strong><u>direct </u></strong>use in marketing or advertising (i.e., to contact you  directly, as opposed to Mediastay contacting you <em>on behalf of</em> the advertiser/business partner in question), you will  always be given the opportunity to remove yourself from the list and you will  NOT be contacted directly by the advertiser/business partner without your prior  consent (and your refusal to provide such consent will not interfere in any manner  with your use and enjoyment of the Website).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>B. Non-PII.  <br>
</strong>Mediastay may use Non-PII in aggregate form for internal       purposes or for creating reports for Mediastay's own use and/or for use by       third party advertisers and business partners.  Note that Mediastay will <strong><u>not </u></strong>obtain your permission       before so using your Non-PII.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>C. Profiles.  <br>
<u>With the objective of customizing each  registered individual's experience in using the Website so that an individual  may maximize his/her use of the Website, Mediastay conducts internal research  on registered individuals' demographics, interests and on-line  preferences/conduct, based on information that registered individuals  themselves provide (be it PII or Non-PII) as well as through the use of cookies  (see Clause IB §2). Mediastay may combine the information yielded by such  sources so as to create profiles about registered individuals which may be  specific to a given individual or aggregate in form.  Mediastay will only use such information for  purposes related to the services offered by Mediastay, its advertisers and  business partners. IF YOU OBJECT TO A PROFILE BEING CREATED ABOUT YOU, DO NOT  REGISTER FOR THE WEBSITE, ESTABLISH A GAME ACCOUNT OR USE THE WEBSITE. </u></strong>
</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>III. OPT-OUT
</h3>
<p>
<strong>A. Generally.  </strong>Subject to the  exceptions set forth in the following subsection of this Clause, at the time  Mediastay gathers any PII from you for a specific purpose, Mediastay will give  you the opportunity to "opt-out" of allowing Mediastay to use your  PII for <strong><u>other </u></strong>purposes, such  as sending you future e-mails or advertising or sharing your PII with business  partners or advertisers. When you opt-out, Mediastay will refrain from using  your PII only for the specific purpose expressly addressed by the opt-out  request. If you wish to change your decision to “opt-out” or “opt-in,” <u>click here</u> to inform Mediastay (see also Clause  VIII).<strong><br>
<br>
B. Exceptions. </strong>Mediastay  may, in the circumstances set forth in this section, use your PII even if you  have notified Mediastay of your desire to opt-out. Mediastay <strong><em>may</em></strong> still use your PII
</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li> 
	<ul>
		<li>For internal purposes, or as  may be necessary to administer the Website; for example, sharing that data with  those persons or entities that administer the Website for Mediastay.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>To comply with applicable law;  for example, but not limited to, compliance with valid legal process such as a  search warrant, subpoena or court order.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>In special cases when Mediastay  has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify  or contact you, or bring legal action against you, if, for example, you may be  causing injury to or interfering with the Website or Mediastay's rights or  property, or the rights of other users of the Website (or otherwise to protect  Mediastay from liability), whether your actions are intentional or unintentional.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
Finally, your PII may be shared with any successors and assigns  Mediastay may have.  
</p>
<h3>IV. SAFETY &amp; SECURITY</h3>
<p>
If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the  general public, always remember to sign off and close your browser window when  you have finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot  access your PII. Mediastay takes steps to help ensure that all information  provided by you, whether PII or Non-PII (as well as the profile that has been  created about you), is treated securely.   Regardless of the precautions taken, no data transmission over the  Internet, however, can be guaranteed to be totally secure. While Mediastay  tries to protect your PII and the information comprising your profile,  Mediastay cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to  Mediastay. <strong><br>
<br>
Your use of the website and  provision of information (including but not limited to PII) to Mediastay is  solely at your own risk and Mediastay makes no representation, warranty or  guarantee as to the safety or security of your information (including PII and  the profile that has been created about you).</strong>
</p>
<h3>V. CO-BRANDED MICROSITES</h3>
<p>
Web pages and/or micro websites may be included within the <a href="http://www.kingolotto.com/">www.kingolotto.com</a> Website and may be co-branded with third party names, logos, and/or properties,  and are operated and maintained by Mediastay. While such third parties are  sponsors of these web pages or micro websites, they do not receive from  Mediastay any PII collected within those web pages or micro websites (nor will  profiles created about registered individuals based on information collected  within those web pages or micro websites be provided to such third parties).
</p>
<h3>VI. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISEMENTS/WEBSITES</h3>
<p>
Mediastay will include on the Website banner and/or text  advertisements for third parties (or for websites operated by third parties)  that are <strong><u>not </u></strong>sponsors of and  are <strong><u>not </u></strong>affiliated with the  www.kingolotto.com Website.  Mediastay  will attempt to make it obvious when you are leaving the www.kingolotto.comWebsite and going to a third party  website, by opening a new window or otherwise notifying you that you are  leaving <a href="http://www.kingolotto.com/">www.kingolotto.com</a>.  However, notwithstanding the clarity or  effectiveness of such notification, Mediastay disclaims any and all  responsibility for the content, practices, or information practices of the  websites operated by these third parties. Your use of such third party websites  is solely at your own risk. In addition, these advertisements do not constitute  sponsorship, endorsement, authorization or approval by Mediastay of the  content, policies, or practices of these websites. All users should check the  relevant website's privacy policy in order to understand their policies and  practices regarding the collection and use of PII <strong><u>prior to </u></strong>providing any PII on such websites.
</p>
<h3>VII. CONSENT TO PRIVACY POLICY/CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>
By accessing and using this Website, you agree to abide by and be  bound by this Privacy Policy; <strong><u>IF YOU  DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE,  REGISTER FOR ANY INSTALLMENT OF THE USA KINGOLOTTO GAME (OR ESTABLISH A GAME  ACCOUNT) OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE ANY PII.</u></strong> Mediastay reserves the right, at  any time or times, to change the content of this Privacy Policy.  Mediastay will post such changes on the  Website.  Such revisions to the Privacy  Policy will take effect immediately upon publication and, by using the Website  (and/or providing PII) after such changes have taken effect (except only as  noted below), you agree to the Privacy Policy in such revised form, without  caveat or qualification of any kind.  It  is therefore strongly recommended that you regularly review the Privacy Policy  for changes.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if Mediastay decides to use your PII in a manner which is significantly  different than as set forth herein (as determined by Mediastay in its sole  discretion) or otherwise materially changes this Privacy Policy (as determined  by Mediastay in its sole discretion), Mediastay will post a notice of such  action on the Website and notify you by e-mail, and you may then decide whether  or not Mediastay may use your PII in the new manner.
</p>
