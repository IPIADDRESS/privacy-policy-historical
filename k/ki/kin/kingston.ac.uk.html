        <h3>Data protection</h3>
        <p>Kingston University endeavours to comply fully with the Data  Protection Act 1998 in its handling of personal data. We aim to keep your data  safely and securely and to use them only for stated purposes. Details of the  University's Notification to the Information Commissioner setting out brief  details of how we use your data can be found by clicking on the following link  and  entering "Kingston University" in the Name field:          <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/ESDWebPages/search.asp" class="popup">www.ico.gov.uk/ESDWebPages/search.asp<span class="printonly">1</span></a> </p>
        <p>Where you give us personal data through the website in order for  us to provide you with a service, your data will be used in connection with  that service. In some cases we may hold data for use in connection with future  contacts you may make with the University. For example, data obtained during  the recruitment process may be linked with data subsequently collected if you  enrol as a student. </p>
        <p>          We do not sell or give your data to other organisations for  marketing purposes. We may use your data to make you aware of similar services  to those you may have used or enquired about. We will offer you the opportunity  to decline such future contact. </p>
        <p>          We may pass some of your data to other organisations if this is  required by law, is necessary for the prevention or detection of crime or is  necessary in order to provide particular services to you. In particular it may  be necessary to share data with organisations (such as other colleges and  universities) that we work in partnership with or which are involved in student  funding services (such as local authorities and the Student Loans Company) or  other collaborative arrangements. Note that the Faculty of Health and Social  Care Sciences is a joint faculty with St George's, University of London, and  that institution may also have access to Faculty-held data. Under the  government funding regulations and/or by law, the University is required to  share some personal data with government departments or agencies acting on  their behalf. </p>
        <p>          Some data collected may be used for our own research purposes in  anonymous and non-attributable form. &nbsp;</p>
        <p> Please note that in most cases the University is unable to  disclose information about students in response to third party requests  (including those made by parents) without the prior written consent of the  individual concerned, unless it is necessary to do so in order to comply with legal  requirements or to prevent or detect crime.</p>
        <p>          You have the right under the Act to request copies of personal  data relating to yourself that are held by the University, subject to a charge  of £10.&nbsp;Such requests should be made in  writing to the address below, accompanied by a cheque for £10 made payable to  "Kingston University".&nbsp; It is helpful if  you can provide information that may assist us in our search for the data that  you are seeking, such as your University ID number, or details of departments  with which you may have had contact. On  receipt of these, the University will send you copies of data as soon as  possible, and in any event within 40 days, provided exemptions specified by the  Act do not apply. </p>
