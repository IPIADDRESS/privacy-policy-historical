      <h4><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h4>
      <p class="text1">Kingston University endeavours to fully comply  with the Data Protection Act 1998 in its handling of personal data. We aim to  keep your data safely and securely and to use it only for stated purposes. Details  of the University’s Notification to the Information Commissioner setting out  brief details of how we use your data can be found through <a href="http://www.esd.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/esd/search.asp" target="_blank">http://www.esd.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/esd/search.asp</a> 
  by  typing Kingston University in the “Name” field. </p>
      <p class="text1">Where  you give us personal data through the website in order for us to provide you  with a service, your data will be used in connection with that service. In some  cases we may hold data for use in connection with future contacts you may make  with the University. For example, data obtained during the recruitment process  may be linked with data subsequently collected if you enrol as a student. </p>
      <p class="text1">We  do not sell or give your data to other organisations for marketing purposes. We  may use your data to make you aware of similar services to those you may have  used or enquired about. We will offer you the opportunity to decline such  future contact. </p>
      <p class="text1">We  may pass some of your data to other organisations if this is required by law,  is necessary for the prevention or detection of crime or is necessary in order  to provide particular services to you. In particular it may be necessary to  share data with organisations (such as other colleges and universities) that we  work in partnership with or which are involved in student funding services  (such as local authorities and the Student Loans Company) or other  collaborative arrangements. Note that the Faculty of Health and Social Care  Sciences is a joint Faculty with St. George’s London who may also have  access to Faculty held data. Under the government funding regulations and/or by  law, the University is required to share some personal data with government  departments or agencies acting on their behalf. </p>
      <p class="text1">Some  data collected may be used for our own research purposes in anonymous and non-attributable  form. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="text1">If  you have any queries relating to data protection or the use of data by the  University, or wish to have access to your personal data held by the  University, &nbsp;please contact the <br>
        Data  Protection Officer, <br>

      <p class="text1"><strong>Use of the website</strong></p>
      <p class="text1">Cookies  may be used on some parts of the University website. These are small pieces of  information that are sent to your computer (unless you block them). They are  stored on your computer and help us to recognise you if you return to our site  at a later stage. This can save you time on future visits by storing  information you may have previously entered onto our site. Cookies cannot run  programs or deliver viruses to your computer. </p>
      <p class="text1">If  you block the use of cookies you may find that some sections of the website  will not operate correctly. </p>
      <p class="text1">When  you use the website, information about the IP address and browser that your  computer is using will be made known to us. We may use such information to monitor  how our websites are used, which pages are visited and how often visits are  made. </p>
      <p class="text1"><strong>Electronic Payments</strong></p>
      <p class="text1">Where  our website provides facilities for electronic payments the data collected  through these pages will be securely encrypted for your protection. You need to  take care when entering details such as credit card data to ensure that your  details cannot be seen by others standing near to you. You should be  particularly careful if using a computer in a public place such as a library or  internet café. When you make electronic payments your data will be transferred  to the appropriate finance company for verification and in order for the  payment to be made to us. When you have finished the transaction ensure that  you have signed off from our site so that another user cannot return to your details. </p>
      <p class="text1"><strong>Links to other websites</strong></p>
      <p class="text1">This  privacy policy only covers pages within the Kingston University  website. It does not extend to sites to which a link is provided from the  University site. Nor does it necessarily apply to subsidiary companies of the University  unless their own site states that this is the case. </p>
