                      Harris may share the following personally identifiable information 
                      with its advertisers, sponsors, and partners in the following

                      information to any third party except in special situations 
                      described above, and as to comply with the law or administer 
                      the Site. Other than as described above, Harris will only

                      the information you have provided to us in aggregate form 
                      — that is, as a summary report showing, for instance, 
                      how many residents of a specific state subscribed to our 
                      publication or participated in a contest.</p>

                      have opted out of receiving special offers or emails from 
                      selected third parties, we may provide a report to an advertiser 
                      or partner which tells them who responded to a particular 
                      offer. For example, we might send you an email which offers 
                      you a discount on a particular product. If you click on 
                      that e-mail or accept an offer or discount contained therein, 
                      we may provide the advertiser with the personally identifiable

                      in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other 
                      legal process. Harris may also disclose information when 
                      we have reason to believe that disclosing this information 
                      is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action 
                      against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use, or 
                      to protect the safety of our users or the public. In addition, 
                      Harris may disclose or access personally identifiable information

                      You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally 
                      identifiable information and that choice will not prevent 
                      you from using the Site. Please note, however, that you 
                      must provide some personally identifiable information in 
                      order to subscribe to KING, to enter any of the Site contests, 
                      promotions or sweepstakes, to post messages on the Site, 
                      or to receive our retailer promo pack</p>
                    <p class="body">You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving 
                      emails from Harris or from having your personally identifiable 
                      information shared in any fashion with selected companies. 
                      If you wish to do so send an email to webmaster@king-mag.com. 
                      If you send us a message with the phrase "remove" 
                      in the subject line we will not disclose your personally 
                      identifiable information or send you emails or other offers 
                      or promotions. However, Harris may continue to use your 
                      personally identifiable information for internal purposes, 
                      to conduct contests, sweepstakes and promotions, to enhance 
                      your user experience or as necessary to administer the Site 
                      or comply with applicable law.</p>
                    <p class="body">What happens when I go to linked sites?<br>
                      When you are on Harris, you may be directed to other sites 
                      that are beyond our control. For example, if you "click" 
                      on a sponsor’s logo, the "click" may take 
                      you off the Harris Site. These other sites may independently 
                      collect data, solicit personally identifiable information, 
                      or send their own cookies to you. Harris is not responsible 
                      for any use of the information including click-stream data 
                      that you may create when using such 3rd party sites.</p>
                    <p class="body">What is Harris's policy regarding children's 
                      privacy?<br>
                      Harris is committed to the safety of our children. Children 
                      under 13 may not register or participate in any contest, 
                      sweepstakes or promotion on the Site.. The Site is neither 
                      directed to nor intended for children under 13. Any child 
                      under 13 who chooses to use the Site should always ask a 
                      parent for permission before sending any information to 
                      the Site. In addition:</p>

                      Harris assigns a random number to each user for anonymously 
                      tracking traffic patterns. This random number is kept in 
                      a file on your computer called a "cookie." Cookies 
                      allow Harris to keep track of how often users are visiting 
                      specific areas of our Site - or simply how many times a 
                      user visits our Site each month.</p>

                      you should contact the software manufacturer. You should 
                      be aware, however, that many areas of Harris will be significantly 
                      slower, or may not function at all, if cookies are disabled</p>
