<p>KIXEYE may use cookies and similar tracking devices. A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a user’s computer. Cookies generally do not include people’s names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user’s computer and to “remember” things about the user’s visit (such as the user’s use of various features on the service).

A computer MAC address identifies one specific piece of hardware.</p>
<p>Other information that may be passively collected by KIXEYE includes log files that record website activity, including how many “hits” a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. “navigational data”). These entries are generated anonymously and enable KIXEYE to assess overall online activity and a user’s browsing habits, track interest in advertised sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you.</p>

<p>When you submit information on KIXEYE, or information is automatically collected as described in this Privacy Policy, KIXEYE uses the submitted information to send you promotional materials, to provide you with access to our services, to fulfill product orders, and to respond to questions or technical problems.
