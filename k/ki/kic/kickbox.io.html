Except as described in this policy, we do not share, sell, rent, trade or loan personal data, including verified email addresses, to third parties for any purpose. Additionally, except where described in this policy, Kickbox does not utilize or retain the email addresses you verify using this service. This Privacy Policy describes how Kickbox, LLC (\"Kickbox\") treats information that it collects and receives related to your use of Kickbox's hosted email verification service (the \"Service\").\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to Kickbox services only.

This Account Data is stored on our secure servers.\n\nYou are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your pass phrase and user Account Data.

We rely on our support desk provider, Freshdesk, to store this information and use it to supply you with support and to improve the Service.\n\n## Posts to Support Forum and Blog.\n\nInformation and communications that you post to our support forum or to our blog are publicly available. If you use the support forum or post to the blog you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums or by the public, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

Kickbox reserves the right to terminate the accounts of visitors who use these services in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Use.\n\n## Information that Kickbox Collects and Uses.\n\nIn addition to Account Data, Kickbox collects information about the nature of your usage of the Service which can include: IP addresses of users, date/time stamp, Verification Metadata and Verification Audit Data. \"Verification Metadata\" includes a one-way encrypted (hashed) version of email addresses sent for verification using the Service. \"Verification Audit Data\" includes the date/time stamp a verification has been performed and the results of the verification.\n\nCSV Verification Data is stored for a period of up to 90-days on an encrypted file system. This data can include the original uploaded CSV data, including email addresses, and the Verification Audit Data.\n\nThis information is collected in order to render Services to you.  Kickbox collects only the necessary and relevant data required to deliver, monitor, and secure Services for you.\n\n## Cookies.\n\nKickbox uses session cookies in the account establishment process. We also use persistent cookies to enable the \"keep me logged in\" feature. A session terminates when the user logs out. The session cookies are stored temporarily thereafter and self-destruct after a short period of time (normally within hours). We do not use cookies to store any personally identifiable information. If you would prefer not to accept session cookies, please turn them off in your browser. If you disable cookies, the features of the Service that require the user to be logged in will not function with cookies disabled.

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user bases as a whole. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.\n\nThis Web site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (\"Google\").

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Web site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Web site, compiling reports on Web site activity for Web site operators and providing other services relating to Web site activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Web site. By using this Web site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.\n\n## Information Sharing and Disclosure.\n\nExcept as described in following paragraphs of this section, Kickbox will not share your Account Data, Verification Metadata, or Sensitive Verification Data with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or Kickbox believes the disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with a judicial proceeding, subpoena, warrant court order, or legal process, (2) protect and defend our rights and property, (3) protect our customers or users, including from misuse or unauthorized use of the Service, or (4) protect the safety or property of our employees, customers, users or others. Kickbox may have to disclose information to third parties when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to conform to applicable law, or to comply with legal process served on Kickbox. Under such circumstances, Kickbox may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of the disclosure, and Kickbox reserves the right to not provide such notice in its sole discretion.\n\nKickbox may disclose or transfer your Account Data, Verification Metadata, or log files (1) to its corporate affiliates (for example its subsidiaries or parent corporation), (2) to its service providers (like hosting services), but only for their use to provide services to Kickbox, or (3) to an acquirer in connection with the sale of the business or assets of Kickbox. Kickbox will require its corporate affiliates and service providers that receive Account Data or Verification Metadata to limit their use and disclosure of your information to the purposes for which you provided it. Kickbox may collect and provide to third parties aggregated statistics about our customers, sales, usage patterns, and related information that do not include personally identifying information.\n\n## Communications from the Kickbox Site.\n\n**Newsletters.** If you opt-in on the account registration, we use this information to send you email communications, including informative newsletters about Kickbox product upgrades, product updates and new products and services. You may opt out of receiving such communications by following the instructions in the \"Opt Out\" section of this Privacy Policy.\n\n**Service-related announcements.** We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Information we collect is stored in a secure manner that is only accessible by authorized Kickbox personnel or service providers and is only disclosed under the provisions of this Privacy Policy. Our servers are located in the U.S.A.\n\nUsers log into the Service using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Passwords are encrypted before they are transmitted and are stored encrypted.\n\nEmail verification is done by automatic processes. Kickbox employees do not examine the contents of customer email verifications except when Kickbox in its discretion determines that it is required to address an issue with the Service, by law or government agency, or as permitted by the customer. When you upload a CSV to our Service the CSV data and verification data is transmitted to Amazon's S3 service for storage.\n\n## Children's Personal Information.\n\nThe Kickbox Web site complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\"). Kickbox does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through the Service. In addition, in the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13 within the Service, Kickbox will not collect, store or use any personal information of such user. Further, in the event that Kickbox receives personal information that Kickbox discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, Kickbox will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner.\n\n## Links to Third Party Sites.\n\nAs a convenience to you, we may provide links to third-party web sites from within the Service. Kickbox is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites.\n\n## Access/Removal of Your Personal Information.\n\nIf you want us to remove your Account Data or from our database, or would like to access the information that was collected from you, please contact us at help:::at:::kickbox.io.  \n\n## Opt out.\n\nIf you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter.\n\n## Changes in this Privacy Policy\n\nIf we decide to alter our privacy policy disclosures, we will post those material changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.

Kickbox is committed to protecting the privacy of all its Web site visitors and users. Except as described in this policy, we do not share, sell, rent, trade or loan personal data, including verified email addresses, to third parties for any purpose. Additionally, except where described in this policy, Kickbox does not utilize or retain the email addresses you verify using this service. This Privacy Policy describes how Kickbox, LLC ("Kickbox") treats information that it collects and receives related to your use of Kickbox's hosted email verification service (the "Service").

This Privacy Policy applies to Kickbox services only. Other sites may place their own cookie or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.

## Account Data.

To utilize the Service, you must create an account. Setting up an account requires you to provide your first and last name, a verifiable email address and a pass phrase ("Account Data"). Kickbox uses this information to identify you as an authorized user. This Account Data is stored on our secure servers.

You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your pass phrase and user Account Data. You are responsible for all actions occurring under your account using your pass phrase.

## Technical Support.

If you request technical support online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction such as your name, email address and information about your computer hardware, software, and the nature of the problem that you are experiencing. We rely on our support desk provider, Freshdesk, to store this information and use it to supply you with support and to improve the Service.

## Posts to Support Forum and Blog.

Information and communications that you post to our support forum or to our blog are publicly available. If you use the support forum or post to the blog you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums or by the public, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

## Information that Kickbox Collects and Uses.

In addition to Account Data, Kickbox collects information about the nature of your usage of the Service which can include: IP addresses of users, date/time stamp, Verification Metadata and Verification Audit Data. "Verification Metadata" includes a one-way encrypted (hashed) version of email addresses sent for verification using the Service. "Verification Audit Data" includes the date/time stamp a verification has been performed and the results of the verification.

CSV Verification Data is stored for a period of up to 90-days on an encrypted file system. This data can include the original uploaded CSV data, including email addresses, and the Verification Audit Data.

This information is collected in order to render Services to you.  Kickbox collects only the necessary and relevant data required to deliver, monitor, and secure Services for you.

The session cookies are stored temporarily thereafter and self-destruct after a short period of time (normally within hours). We do not use cookies to store any personally identifiable information. If you would prefer not to accept session cookies, please turn them off in your browser. If you disable cookies, the features of the Service that require the user to be logged in will not function with cookies disabled. We recommend that you close your browser after logging out.

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user bases as a whole. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.

This Web site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google").

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Web site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Web site, compiling reports on Web site activity for Web site operators and providing other services relating to Web site activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Web site. By using this Web site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure.

Except as described in following paragraphs of this section, Kickbox will not share your Account Data, Verification Metadata, or Sensitive Verification Data with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or Kickbox believes the disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with a judicial proceeding, subpoena, warrant court order, or legal process, (2) protect and defend our rights and property, (3) protect our customers or users, including from misuse or unauthorized use of the Service, or (4) protect the safety or property of our employees, customers, users or others. Kickbox may have to disclose information to third parties when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to conform to applicable law, or to comply with legal process served on Kickbox. Under such circumstances, Kickbox may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of the disclosure, and Kickbox reserves the right to not provide such notice in its sole discretion.

Kickbox may disclose or transfer your Account Data, Verification Metadata, or log files (1) to its corporate affiliates (for example its subsidiaries or parent corporation), (2) to its service providers (like hosting services), but only for their use to provide services to Kickbox, or (3) to an acquirer in connection with the sale of the business or assets of Kickbox. Kickbox will require its corporate affiliates and service providers that receive Account Data or Verification Metadata to limit their use and disclosure of your information to the purposes for which you provided it. Kickbox may collect and provide to third parties aggregated statistics about our customers, sales, usage patterns, and related information that do not include personally identifying information.

You may opt out of receiving such communications by following the instructions in the "Opt Out" section of this Privacy Policy.

**Service-related announcements.** We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Information we collect is stored in a secure manner that is only accessible by authorized Kickbox personnel or service providers and is only disclosed under the provisions of this Privacy Policy. Our servers are located in the U.S.A.

Users log into the Service using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Passwords are encrypted before they are transmitted and are stored encrypted.

Email verification is done by automatic processes. Kickbox employees do not examine the contents of customer email verifications except when Kickbox in its discretion determines that it is required to address an issue with the Service, by law or government agency, or as permitted by the customer. When you upload a CSV to our Service the CSV data and verification data is transmitted to Amazon's S3 service for storage.
