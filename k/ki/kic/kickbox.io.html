Except as described in this policy, we do not share, sell, rent, trade or loan personal data, including verified email addresses, to third parties for any purpose. Additionally, except where described in this policy, Kickbox does not utilize or retain the email addresses you verify using this service. This Privacy Policy describes how Kickbox, Inc. ("Kickbox") treats information that it collects and receives related to your use of Kickbox's hosted email verification service (the "Service").
