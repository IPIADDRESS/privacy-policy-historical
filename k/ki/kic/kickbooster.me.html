        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Protecting your privacy is important to Kickbooster Inc. (“Kickbooster”)</p>
        <p>Kickbooster develops online referral marketing tools to help Crowdfunding Campaign Admins drive more traffic and sales through various platforms, such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo.   Kickbooster has adopted this Privacy Statement to guide you through the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (“Personal Data”, as further described below) that you may provide while using Kickbooster websites, apps, and services in connection with these platforms (collectively referred to as “Services”).  Kickbooster encourages you to read this Privacy Statement, as well as our Terms and Conditions of Use, in order to understand how we collect and process Personal Data in the course of providing the Services and your interaction with the Services.</p>
        <p>By using the Services, you consent to the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of your Personal Data for processing as described in, and subject to the limitations set out in, this Privacy Statement.</p>
        <p><strong>Note to Residents of European Union:</strong> In order to comply with the requirements of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for our European users, this Privacy Statement outlines the legal basis on which we process your Personal Data and provides other information required by the GDPR.</p>

        <h3>Personal Data</h3>
        <p>Personal Data is any information that would identify a person directly, or indirectly in combination with data from other sources.  For example, a full name, home or work address, phone number, national identification number (SSN, SIN, etc), email address, banking details, IP address, biometric data, usage data, or any information that may individually identify a person.</p>
        <p>Kickbooster may collect Personal Data including without limitation your name, shipping and billing addresses, phone number, email address, payment information, PayPal address, IP address, and device identifiers and/or geolocation information, in the course of its Services, and may use or disclose that Personal Data as described with this Privacy Statement.</p>
        <p>Kickbooster may also create de-identified or anonymized data from Personal Data by excluding data components (such as your name, email address, etc.) that makes the data able to personally identify you, through obfuscation, or through other means. In addition, Kickbooster may collect and use aggregated, anonymous information to provide data about the Services to advertisers, potential business partners and other unaffiliated entities. As this information does not identify a person, and is therefore not Personal Data, Kickbooster’s use of such aggregated, anonymized and/or de-identified data is not subject to this Privacy Statement.</p>

        <h3>Consent and Collection of Personal Data</h3>
        <p>If you use a Kickbooster website, or conduct a transaction through a Kickbooster Service where Personal Data is essential, your consent is implied to collect and use your Personal Data to facilitate that use or complete that transaction initiated by you only. This is the case where you provide Personal Data directly to Kickbooster for this purpose, or where you provide Personal Data to a Campaign Admin (as defined in our Terms of Use) to facilitate your participation in a campaign and that Data is processed by Kickbooster on the campaign admin’s behalf.</p>
        <p>Examples of instances in which Personal Data may be collected by Kickbooster are, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you make, adjust, or cancel a purchase through a Kickbooster affiliate link,</li>
          <li>When you access or navigate a Kickbooster website, or engage in communication and/or business transaction with Kickbooster, </li>
          <li>If you knowingly submit Personal Data through a Kickbooster website for the purpose of registering for a service, a contest, or authentication.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During these instances, we may collect data such as, but not restricted to: areas of the Services or Kickbooster websites you visit, transaction type(s) you engage in or request (and amounts thereof), content you view, your IP address, data downloaded or submitted by you, transaction amount, payment information provided by you, shipping and billing information, as well as the nature, quantity and price of the goods or services you exchange and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate or transact business using the Services.</p>
        <p>In the event Kickbooster requests Personal Data for scenarios independent of the above, such as marketing-related questions via questionnaires, surveys, and profile data, it will include a specific consent request.  The consent request will include a clear purpose and goal for the collection of Personal Data, along with a means of withdrawing consent.  In these scenarios, we may ask for data such as, but not limited to: your contact information (name, telephone numbers, email address, mailing address), date of birth, product and/or cosmetic concerns, which brands and products you use, user authentication and security information (e.g. username and password).</p>
        <p>If at any point you wish to withdraw consent to Personal Data collection, please contact the Kickbooster Privacy Officer via the Contact &amp; Questions area at the bottom of this Privacy Statement.  Please note that certain Services may only be able to be offered or provided to you if you disclose the Personal Data necessary to facilitate those Services, and therefore Kickbooster may not be able to provide you with certain Services in the event that you choose not to disclose that Personal Data to Kickbooster.</p>

        <h3>Age of Consent</h3>
        <p>The Services offered by Kickbooster are directed towards and designed for the use of persons above the age of majority in your province, state, or country.  Persons under the age of majority are not permitted to use the Services on their own, and Kickbooster will not approve applications of, or establish, or maintain accounts or memberships for, any persons below their respective region’s age of majority.</p>
        <p>Kickbooster does not solicit or knowingly collect Personal Data from persons below the age of majority of their region.  If we discover we have received Personal Data of a person below the age of majority, we will delete such information from our systems.  Additionally, if a parent or legal guardian believes that Personal Data regarding a minor in their care has been provided to Kickbooster, they may request the minor’s information be corrected or deleted by contacting the Kickbooster Privacy Officer via the Contact &amp; Questions area at the bottom of this Privacy Statement.</p>

        <h3>Anonymous Information</h3>
        <p>When you interact with a Kickbooster Service, similar to most other websites, apps, and online services, certain anonymous technical information about your visit is automatically logged and collected by Kickbooster.  This may include information about the type of browser you use, operating system, the date and time you access the Service, the links you accessed while using the Service, and the internet address of the website, if any, which linked directly to the Kickbooster Service.  This information is used for system administration purposes such as diagnosing problems with Kickbooster’s Services, servers and websites, compiling aggregated and statistical information, and to improve the operation and content of Kickbooster’s website and Services.  It is not personally identifiable, and is not considered Personal Data and subject to this Privacy Statement.</p>

        <h3>Personal Data Use</h3>
        <p>Kickbooster may use collected Personal Data for such purposes as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Helping to establish and verify the identity of users, and to keep user accounts secure,</li>
          <li>Opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users’ accounts or memberships,</li>
          <li>Providing Services and support to users,</li>
          <li>Improving Kickbooster’s websites, including tailoring its websites to users’ preferences,</li>
          <li>If you are an Affiliate User (someone who earns rewards for generating referred sales using Kickbooster, defined in our Terms of Use), with your consent, Kickbooster may share your Personal Data with Campaign Admins to help facilitate communication between you. Kickbooster takes reasonable steps to ensure Campaign Admin has its own data privacy policy, which can be accessed on your dashboard. Please make sure you review the Campaign Admin's privacy policy. If at any time you wish to withdraw your consent to us sharing your Personal Data, please update your prefernces within your dashboard accordingly.</li>

          <li>Providing users with product or Service updates, promotional notices and offers, and other information about Kickbooster and its affiliates,</li>
          <li>Corresponding with you, and responding to your questions, inquiries, comments, and instructions,</li>
          <li>Maintaining the security and integrity of Kickbooster systems, and,</li>
          <li>Complying with applicable laws.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once collected, Kickbooster will store and process your Personal Data in secure locations.  Kickbooster may transmit data outside of Canada for the purposes of processing and executing transactions related to the Services, or for the purpose of executing transactions on behalf of Campaign Admins that have registered and make use of Kickboosters online tools.  Where this transmission occurs, the security measures outlined in this Privacy Statement will continue to apply.</p>
        <p>Personal Data will only be retained by Kickbooster for the length of time required to fulfill the purpose or complete the transaction for which it was collected, or as may be required by law.  Beyond that point, Personal Data in the possession or control of Kickbooster will be anonymized or securely destroyed.</p>

        <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
        <p>This section addresses the legal basis for processing your Personal Data if you reside outside of Canada and in the European Economic Area (within Canada, you typically provide consent when you receive notice of this Privacy Statement in a website link or mobile app).</p>
        <p><strong>Lawful Basis for Processing</strong></p>
        <p>Data protection law in the European Union requires a "lawful basis" for collecting and retaining Personal Data from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area. Kickbooster collects and processes your Personal Data for a variety of purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement. In certain cases, separate consent to this processing is not required, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For the performance of a contract: To perform our contractual obligations to you, including account registration, fulfilling orders or purchases you have made (including processing of payment), contacting you in relation to any issues with your order, in relation to the provision of the Services, where Kickbooster needs to provide your Personal Data to our service providers to provide the Services, or to aggregate and centralize data for the performance of the Services.</li>
          <li>To meet legal obligations: To comply with laws, regulations, court orders, or other legal obligations or to assist in an investigation.</li>
          <li>For legitimate interests: To operate Kickbooster’s business and provide the Services, other than in performing our contractual obligations to you, except where overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of Personal Data. For example, the following areas include processing permitted due to legitimate interests:
            <ul>
              <li>Communication. To communicate with you regarding the Services, including to provide you important notices regarding changes to Kickbooster’s Terms of Use, and also to address your requests, inquiries, and complaints. Kickbooster may send strictly necessary communications, including emails, even if you have opted out of receiving other Kickbooster emails or communications. These types of communications do not require consent.

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>Kickbooster maintains reasonable physical, technical, and administrative security measures to minimize the risk of unauthorized loss, theft, copying, misuse, access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of your Personal Data.</p>
        <p>If transactions are offered as part of a Kickbooster Service, transaction information is transmitted to and from Kickbooster in encrypted form using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connections to help protect such information, including Personal Data transmitted in the course of these transactions, from interception.</p>
        <p>Kickbooster also restricts access to your Personal Information to only those persons who have a legitimate business need or legal requirement to view it in connection with the Services.  You, as a Personal Data owner, may also authorize any persons you may choose to have access to your Personal Data.</p>
        <p>Although Kickbooster does utilize security measures appropriate to the level of risk, no method of data transfer or storage on the internet is 100% secure and security risks cannot be eliminated entirely.  As such, Kickbooster cannot guarantee perfect security, integrity, or confidentiality of Personal Data.</p>
        <p>Kickbooster maintains a security incident response protocol to be put in place in the event that the security of your Personal Data in the possession or control of Kickbooster is compromised. In the event of a data breach or security incident involving the Services, Kickbooster will apply this protocol to enable Kickbooster to effectively and efficiently respond to, and contain, the breach or incident. Kickbooster may also seek to notify you in such event. If notification is appropriate or required, Kickbooster may notify you by email, messaging to your device, or other reasonable means.</p>

        <h3>Disclosure of Personal Data</h3>
        <p>Kickbooster does not provide Personal Data to unaffiliated third parties for their use in marketing directly to you.  We may use unaffiliated companies, or trusted third party service providers, to help maintain and operate our Services for reasons related to our business operations and to better serve you, and those companies may receive your Personal Data for that purpose.  For example, Kickbooster may use third party payment processor services in connection with the Services and its websites, and the payment information that you provide to Kickbooster may be disclosed to and used by these payment processors for the purposes of completing and executing transactions requested or initiated by you. When Kickbooster shares Personal Data with third-party services that support our delivery of the Services, we require that they use your Personal Data only for the purposes we’ve authorized, and that they protect your Personal Data to at least the same standards used by Kickbooster.</p>
        <p>As part of agreements with Campaign Admins who have registered to use Kickbooster and the execution of transactions on behalf of Campaign Admins that make use of Kickbooster’s online tool in connection with their crowdfunding campaign, we may disclose Personal Data which has been collected by us that is specific to that Campaign and your transactions in connection therewith. In addition, we may also disclose your Personal Data with specific Campaign Admins where you have agreed to participate in communicating with said Campaign Admin.</p>
        <p>Kickbooster may also disclose Personal Data about you in connection with legal requirements, such as in response to an authorized subpoena, governmental request or investigation, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law (including, without limitation, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect Kickbooster’s legal rights, property, or the safety of Kickbooster, its employees, users or others).</p>
        <p>Finally, as Kickbooster’s business develops, it may sell or buy corporate assets, and in such transactions Personal Data may be one of the transferred business assets.  If Kickbooster, its internet businesses, or substantially all of its shares or assets, is acquired or an acquisition is contemplated, Personal Data may be one of the assets assessed or transferred in connection with that transaction.</p>
        
        <p>A list of Data Processors engaged by Kickbooster who may receive Personal Data is available <a href="/data_processors">here</a>. New processors will be added to this list 30 days prior to being integrated into our Services. If you are subject to the GDPR and have objections to a Data Processor addition, please contact the Kickbooster Privacy Officer via the Contact &amp; Questions area at the bottom of this Privacy Statement. Objections to Data Processors may impact the Services which can be offered or provided to you by Kickbooster.</p>
