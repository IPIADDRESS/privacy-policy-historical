This Privacy  Policy sets forth our and our Service Provider’s policies with respect to  information including personally identifiable data (“<em><strong>Personal Data</strong></em>”) and other  information that is collected from you when using the Site. Unless otherwise  stated in this Privacy Policy, this policy shall be deemed to apply to us and  our Service Provider and all references to “we”, “us” and/or “our” shall  include our Service Provider.</p>

		  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
		  <p>When you interact with us through the  Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further  described below:</p>
		  <p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: </strong>We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily choose to provide  such information such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of  our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services.  Wherever we collect Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this  Privacy Policy. By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are  consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you  provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such  Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to offices and  servers of Service Provider, its affiliates and their contractors located in  the United States and other countries.</p>
		  <h3 style="padding:15px 0px 0px">Other Information:</h3>
   <p><em><strong>Non-Identifiable Data: </strong></em>When you  utilize the Site, we may receive certain personally non-identifiable  information about your use of the Site. Such information, which is collected  passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically  identify you. We may store such information ourselves or it may be included in  databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or service providers.  We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for  example, the total number of visitors to the Site, the number of visitors to  each page of the Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service  providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used  in this process. </p>

		  <p>In operating this Site, we may use  cookies. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer or computers that  host our Site give to your browser when you access a the Site. Our cookies help  provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage  more accurately.

On most web browsers, you will find a “help”  section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to  receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn  cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow  you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features. </p>
		  <p><em><strong>Aggregated Personal Data: </strong></em>In an ongoing  effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, we may conduct  research on our end user’s demographics, interests and behavior based on the  Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be  compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated  data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate  information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated  user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective  business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
		  <h2>Our Use of Your Personal Data and  Other Information</h2>
  <p>We will use the Personal Data you  provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide  Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection  with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by  e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or  resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain  access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide access to such  services and to monitor your use of such services. We may also use your  Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected  through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site,  to better understand our users and to improve the Services. We may use this  information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe  will be of interest to you. </p>

		  <h2>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data  and Other Information</h2>
		  <p>There are certain circumstances in  which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without  further notice to you, including as set forth below: </p>
		  <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop  our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a  sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event relating to all or a  portion of our business, assets or this Site, Personal Data may be part of the  transferred assets. </p>
		  <p><strong>Service Providers, Agents and  Related Third Parties:</strong> We sometimes hire other companies to perform certain  business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining  databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a  function of this nature, we may need to provide them with access to certain  Personal Data. However, we only provide them with the information that they  need to perform their specific function. </p>
		  <p><strong>Legal  Requirements: </strong>We may also disclose your Personal Data if required to do  so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply  with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii)  act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site  or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. </p>
		  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
		  <p>You can use the Site without providing  any Personal Data, however, you may not be able to use certain Services.</p>
		  <p>When You sign up for our Services that  require registration, we ask you to provide Personal Data.&nbsp; If we want to use this Personal Data in a  manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, we will ask for  your consent prior to doing so.&nbsp; If we  propose to use Personal Data for any purposes other than those described in  this Policy and/or in the specific notice of Services, we will offer you an effective  way to opt out of our use of your Personal Data for those other purposes.&nbsp; </p>
		  <h2>Exclusions</h2>

All such Unsolicited Information shall be deemed  to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and  distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or  attribution. Please also note that any Personal Data or other information you  provide to be displayed in your publicly available online profile will be  displayed for others to see and thus will not be subject to the terms of this  Privacy Policy.

		  <h2>Security</h2>

		  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect  the Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and unauthorized  access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These steps include internal  reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security  measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized  access to systems where we store Personal Data.&nbsp;  However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or  error free.
