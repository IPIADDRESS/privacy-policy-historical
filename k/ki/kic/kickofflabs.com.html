At KickoffLabs we have a few fundamental principles:</p><ol><li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.  And hey, it’s more work for us to process data we aren’t actively using.)  We ask that you do the same with your KickoffLabs site. </li><li>We don’t share your personal information, or the customer data you collect, with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.  </li><li>We don’t store personal or customer information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li><li>You are in control of the information you share through a Kickofflabs site and the customer data you collect is your responsibility.  As part of the Terms of Service we require you to respect your customers right to privacy as well as you’d require your data to be respected. </li></ol><p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team at  <a href="mailto:support@kickofflabs.com?subject=Privacy%20Question%3A%20">support@kickofflabs.com</a></p><h4>Website Visitors</h4><p>Like most website operators, KickoffLabs collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. KickoffLabs’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how KickoffLabs’ visitors use its website. From time to time, KickoffLabs may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p><p>KickoffLabs also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving visiting a site hosted by Kickofflabs.com. KickoffLabs only uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p><h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4><p>Certain visitors to KickoffLabs’s websites choose to interact with KickoffLabs in ways that require KickoffLabs to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that KickoffLabs gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who register for our service an email address. Those who engage in transactions with KickoffLabs are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, KickoffLabs collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with KickoffLabs. (We hate long forms too! ) </p><p>KickoffLabs does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain product-related activities.</p><h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4><p>KickoffLabs may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, KickoffLabs may monitor the most popular sites hosted by Kickofflabs.com site to help improve the service we offer to you, our customers.</p><h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4><p>KickoffLabs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on KickoffLabs’s behalf or to provide services available at KickoffLabs’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using KickoffLabs’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. KickoffLabs will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, KickoffLabs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when KickoffLabs believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of KickoffLabs, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an KickoffLabs website and have supplied your email address, KickoffLabs may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with KickoffLabs and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. KickoffLabs takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p><h4>Cookies</h4><p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. KickoffLabs uses cookies to help KickoffLabs identify and track visitors, their usage of KickoffLabs website, and their website access preferences. KickoffLabs visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using KickoffLabs’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of KickoffLabs’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p><h4>Business Transfers</h4><p>If KickoffLabs, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that KickoffLabs goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of KickoffLabs may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p><h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4><p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, KickoffLabs may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in KickoffLabs’s sole discretion. KickoffLabs encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. </p><h4>Attribution</h4><p></p>Portions of this agreement were constructed using the agreement created under the Creative Commons Sharealike license by the great folks at Automatic for <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a></div></div></div></div><div class="info"><div class="info-top"></div><div class="container info-content"><div class="row"><div class="span4 recent_posts"><h6>Recent Blog Posts</h6><div id="blog_feed"><p class="loading">Loading blog posts...</p></div><a href="http://blog.kickofflabs.com" class="em">Read More »</a><div class="clear"></div></div><div class="span4 twitter"><h6>Latest Tweets From <a href="http://twitter.com/kickofflabs">@KickoffLabs</a> </h6><div class="tweet"></div><div class="clear"></div><a href="http://twitter.com/kickofflabs" class="em">Read More »</a></div><div class="span4 newsletter"><div class="social_follow"><h6>Follow Us</h6><a href="https://www.facebook.com/kickofflabs"><i class="icon icon-facebook"></i></a><a href="http://twitter.com/kickofflabs"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/2074963"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/kickofflabs"><i class="icon icon-feed"></i></a><div class="spacer"></div><iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?app_id=193054784084057&amp;href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkickofflabs&amp;send=false&amp;layout=standard&amp;width=295&amp;show_faces=true&amp;action=like&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;font=arial&amp;height=80" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; width:300px; height:80px;" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></div></div><div class="clear"></div></div><div class="clear"></div></div><div class="clear"></div></div><script type="text/javascript">$(document).ready(enable_footer); </script></div><div class="footer"><div class="footer-top"></div><div class="footer-links center"><a href="http://www.kickofflabs.com/" exact_match="true">Home</a><a href="http://www.kickofflabs.com/tour">Features</a><a href="http://www.kickofflabs.com/pricing">Pricing &amp; Signup</a><a href="http://www.kickofflabs.com/showcase">Showcase</a><a href="http://api.kickofflabs.com">API</a><a href="http://www.kickofflabs.com/company">Company</a><a href="http://blog.kickofflabs.com" class="last">Blog</a></div><div class="copyright center">All Rights Reserved © 2012 KickoffLabs. <a href="http://www.kickofflabs.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> - <a href="http://www.kickofflabs.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></div></div><script type="text/javascript">var _gaq = _gaq || [];
