                    your personal privacy is very important to us. We hope the 
                    following statement will help you understand how the radio 
                    stations of Susquehanna Radio Corp. collect, use and safeguard 
                    the personal information you provide to us. Specifics about 
                    what information is collected and how it is used follows this 
                    Privacy Policy Statement. <br>
                    <br>
                    Your personal privacy is a principal concern to us at Susquehanna 
                    Radio Corp. Our goal in outlining our policy on the collection 
                    and use of listener/customer data is to ensure the highest 
                    level of confidentiality and security. When you provide your 
                    personal information to any Susquehanna radio station, we 
                    will not give or sell your personal information to any outside 
                    company for its use in marketing or solicitation. We will 
                    maintain the confidentiality of your personal information 
                    and it will be used only to support your customer relationship 
                    with our radio stations, assisting us in providing better 
                    and more targeted services to you. Additionally, internal 
                    practices are in place to help protect your privacy by limiting 
                    employee access to and use of customer data. When Susquehanna 
                    Radio Corp. asks for customer/listener information, it is 
                    done with the goal of improving the relationship between a 
                    Susquehanna radio station and the listener. At Susquehanna, 
                    we allow our listeners to maintain control over their personal 
                    data while attempting to provide a more interactive online 
                    experience. Our intention is to send e-mail only to listeners/customers 
                    who have chosen to receive such e-mails. At any time, you 
                    have the right to decline receiving future communications 
                    in any manner, including email, fax, telephone and postal 
                    mail. <br>

                    <b>Information Collection </b><br>
                    When you browse any Susquehanna Radio Corp. radio station 
                    Web site, you do so anonymously. Personal information -- including 
                    your e-mail address -- is not collected. Some of our Web sites, 
                    however, may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal 
                    information, including your E-mail address for purposes such 
                    as correspondence, site registration, membership, making a 
                    purchase, contests or participating in online surveys. We 
                    may ask for your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mailing 
                    address and birthdate. Other optional information may be asked 
                    (listener/customer preference information, social security 
                    numbers, lifestyle interests, and other demographic information) 
                    that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or 
                    offers. <br>

                    Like many other commercial Web sites, Susquehanna Radio Corp. 
                    may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect 
                    information about how our site is used. Please read about 
                    Cookies at the end of this statement for more information. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We collect only information that is needed, and we tell listeners/customers 
                    how we use it. We limit the collection of information about 
                    our listeners/customers to what we need to know to manage 
                    their membership, to provide customer service, to offer new 
                    products and services, and to fulfill any legal and regulatory 
                    requirements. We tell our listeners/customers about the general 
                    uses of information we collect about them, and we will provide 
                    additional explanation if requested. We give listeners/customers 
                    choices about how their data will be used. On a regular basis, 
                    we provide our listeners/customers the ability to decline 
                    any or all future email communications. Listeners/customers 
                    may also decide if and how they wish to be contacted via other 
                    communication media. We give listeners/customers access to 
                    their data online. A listener/customer may change, update 
                    or add additional information about themselves at any time 
                    through our radio stations' web sites, which offer this feature. 
                    If a station does not currently provide this ability, listeners/customers 
                    can still change their data profile by contacting the local 
                    station. All Susquehanna Radio Corp. radio stations will provide 
                    this feature in the near future. <br>
                    <br>
                    We ensure information quality. We use advanced technology 
                    and well-defined employee practices to help ensure that listener/customer 
                    data is processed promptly, accurately and completely. <br>
                    <br>
                    We use information security safeguards. Access to listener/customer 
                    data is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct 
                    their business responsibilities. We use security techniques 
                    designed to protect our listener/customer data -- especially 
                    that data which is used by employees and business partners 
                    to fulfill listener/customer services. We limit the release 
                    of listener/customer information. In addition to providing 
                    listeners/customers with the opportunity to refuse marketing 
                    offers, we release information only at the listeners'/customers' 
                    requests, or when required to do so by law or other regulatory 
                    authority. When a court order or subpoena requires us to release 
                    information, we notify the listener/customer directly so that 
                    his/her legal rights can be exercised, if appropriate. The 
                    only exceptions to this policy are when we are prohibited 
                    by court order or law from notifying the listener/customer, 
                    or cases in which fraud and/or criminal activity is suspected. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We hold employees responsible for our privacy principles. 
                    Each Susquehanna Radio Corp. employee is personally responsible 
                    for maintaining listener and customer confidentiality. All 
                    Susquehanna Radio Corp. employees are required to sign an 
                    agreement that they will comply with these policies. Employees 
                    who violate these policies are subject to disciplinary action, 
                    up to and including dismissal. Employees are expected to report 
                    violations -- and may do so confidentially -- to their managers 
                    or other supervisors. Each station has an employee who has 
                    been assigned the responsibility for assuring the adherence 
                    to Susquehanna Radio Corp.'s privacy policy. Check your local 
                    station's web site for this contact. The Susquehanna Radio

                    were originally designed to help a Web site distinguish a

                    any preferences that may have been set while the user was 
                    browsing the site. A cookie is a small string of text that 
                    a Web site can send to your browser. A cookie cannot retrieve 
                    any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, 
                    or capture your E-mail address. Currently, Web sites use cookies 
                    to enhance the user's visit; in general, cookies can securely 
                    store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify

                    If you are just browsing a Susquehanna radio station Web site, 
                    a cookie identifies only your browser. If you sign up for 
                    a free email account at one of our participating sites, a 
                    cookie is issued for security purposes. The cookie is set 
                    when you login and times out 30 minutes after your last interaction 
                    with your email account. After you are logged out (manually 
                    or by the cookie) the cookie is rendered invalid and goes 
                    away when your cache is cleared. This type of security measure 
                    is useful for individuals who share a machine or use a public
