                your personal privacy is very important to us. We hope the following 
                statement will help you understand how the radio stations of Susquehanna 
                Radio Corp. collect, use and safeguard the personal information 
                you provide to us. Specifics about what information is collected 
                and how it is used follows this Privacy Policy Statement. <br>
                <br>
                Your personal privacy is a principal concern to us at Susquehanna 
                Radio Corp. Our goal in outlining our policy on the collection 
                and use of listener/customer data is to ensure the highest level 
                of confidentiality and security. When you provide your personal 
                information to any Susquehanna radio station, we will not give 
                or sell your personal information to any outside company for its 
                use in marketing or solicitation. We will maintain the confidentiality 
                of your personal information and it will be used only to support 
                your customer relationship with our radio stations, assisting 
                us in providing better and more targeted services to you. Additionally, 
                internal practices are in place to help protect your privacy by 
                limiting employee access to and use of customer data. When Susquehanna 
                Radio Corp. asks for customer/listener information, it is done 
                with the goal of improving the relationship between a Susquehanna 
                radio station and the listener. At Susquehanna, we allow our listeners 
                to maintain control over their personal data while attempting 
                to provide a more interactive online experience. Our intention 
                is to send e-mail only to listeners/customers who have chosen 
                to receive such e-mails. At any time, you have the right to decline 
                receiving future communications in any manner, including email, 
                fax, telephone and postal mail. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Privacy Policies </b> <br>
                <br>
                <b>Information Collection </b><br>
                When you browse any Susquehanna Radio Corp. radio station Web 
                site, you do so anonymously. Personal information -- including 
                your e-mail address -- is not collected. Some of our Web sites, 
                however, may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal 
                information, including your E-mail address for purposes such as 
                correspondence, site registration, membership, making a purchase, 
                contests or participating in online surveys. We may ask for your 
                name, e-mail address, telephone number, mailing address and birthdate. 
                Other optional information may be asked (listener/customer preference 
                information, social security numbers, lifestyle interests, and 
                other demographic information) that is needed to register or subscribe 
                you to services or offers. <br>
                <br>
                Like many other commercial Web sites, Susquehanna Radio Corp. 
                may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information 
                about how our site is used. Please read about Cookies at the end 
                of this statement for more information. <br>
                <br>
                We collect only information that is needed, and we tell listeners/customers 
                how we use it. We limit the collection of information about our 
                listeners/customers to what we need to know to manage their membership, 
                to provide customer service, to offer new products and services, 
                and to fulfill any legal and regulatory requirements. We tell 
                our listeners/customers about the general uses of information 
                we collect about them, and we will provide additional explanation 
                if requested. We give listeners/customers choices about how their 
                data will be used. On a regular basis, we provide our listeners/customers 
                the ability to decline any or all future email communications. 
                Listeners/customers may also decide if and how they wish to be 
                contacted via other communication media. We give listeners/customers 
                access to their data online. A listener/customer may change, update 
                or add additional information about themselves at any time through 
                our radio stations' web sites, which offer this feature. If a 
                station does not currently provide this ability, listeners/customers 
                can still change their data profile by contacting the local station. 
                All Susquehanna Radio Corp. radio stations will provide this feature 
                in the near future. <br>
                <br>
                We ensure information quality. We use advanced technology and 
                well-defined employee practices to help ensure that listener/customer 
                data is processed promptly, accurately and completely. <br>
                <br>
                We use information security safeguards. Access to listener/customer 
                data is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct their 
                business responsibilities. We use security techniques designed 
                to protect our listener/customer data -- especially that data 
                which is used by employees and business partners to fulfill listener/customer 
                services. We limit the release of listener/customer information. 
                In addition to providing listeners/customers with the opportunity 
                to refuse marketing offers, we release information only at the 
                listeners'/customers' requests, or when required to do so by law 
                or other regulatory authority. When a court order or subpoena 
                requires us to release information, we notify the listener/customer 
                directly so that his/her legal rights can be exercised, if appropriate. 
                The only exceptions to this policy are when we are prohibited 
                by court order or law from notifying the listener/customer, or 
                cases in which fraud and/or criminal activity is suspected. <br>
                <br>
                We hold employees responsible for our privacy principles. Each 
                Susquehanna Radio Corp. employee is personally responsible for 
                maintaining listener and customer confidentiality. All Susquehanna 
                Radio Corp. employees are required to sign an agreement that they 
                will comply with these policies. Employees who violate these policies 
                are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 
                Employees are expected to report violations -- and may do so confidentially 
                -- to their managers or other supervisors. Each station has an 
                employee who has been assigned the responsibility for assuring 
                the adherence to Susquehanna Radio Corp.'s privacy policy. Check 
                your local station's web site for this contact. The Susquehanna 
                Radio Corp. Corporate Headquarters can be contacted at the following 
                email address: postmaster@Suscom.com. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Information Use </b><br>
                If you provide us with your E-mail address, or have done so in 
                the past, we may send you E-mail offers or newsletters. These 
                offers or newsletters are based on information you provided in 
                your membership application, registration forms, in surveys, from 
                information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, 
                as well as information available from external sources, such as 
                census bureau data. These E-mail offers will come from a Susquehanna 
                Radio Corp. station only. Your information or email address is 
                never sold to a third party. All offers are carefully developed 
                to guarantee that they meet our standards. Our goal is to target 
                offers to listeners/customers who will find them of value. <br>
                <br>
                The data you provide is used to enhance the services and offers 
                our radio stations bring you. As a result of providing personal 
                information, Susquehanna Radio Corp. radio stations can provide 
                a more customized online experience, making your interaction with 
                us more productive, helpful and fun. You can also expect to receive 
                occasional communications targeted directly toward your lifestyle 
                interests. <br>
                <br>
                Declining E-mail Offers - Susquehanna Radio Corp. provides listeners/customers 
                with an easy means to decline receiving E-mail offers and recognizes 
                the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you 
                may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply 
                replying to the E-mail address included in every e-mail message 
                you receive from a Susquehanna Radio Corp. radio station. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Activity Tracking </b><br>
                We do monitor URL click-throughs found in our email messages. 
                The click-through rate is reviewed in order to: track participation 
                in contests in order to judge effectiveness and to award prizes; 
                track listener interests; track response rates for station marketing 
                purposes or to report to a client in aggregate form only, the 
                response of listeners. Individual activity is never shared with 
                employees or third parties. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Children </b><br>
                Susquehanna Radio Corp. does not knowingly solicit data from children, 
                and we will not knowingly market to children. Susquehanna Radio 
                Corp. defines children as anyone under 12 years of age. <br>
                <br>
                <b>What else should I know about my privacy? </b><br>
                Third party Internet sites and services accessible through Susquehanna 
                Radio Corp. radio stations have separate privacy and data collection 
                practices, independent of us. Susquehanna Radio Corp. has no responsibility 
                or liability for these independent policies or actions. You are 
                solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords, 
                membership ID, or any account information. Please be careful and 
                responsible whenever you are online. If you post personal information 
                online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited 
                messages from other parties in return. While we aim to protect 
                your personal information, Susquehanna Radio Corp. cannot ensure 
                or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, 
                and you do so at your own risk. <br>
                <br>
                While each Susquehanna Radio Corp. station puts forth its best 
                efforts in adhering to these minimum privacy standards, additional 
                restrictions may be imposed to comply with state and local laws, 
                and/or station specific programs, products and services. <br>
