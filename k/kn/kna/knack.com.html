This Privacy Statement applies exclusively to the site www.knack.com (the "Site").  This policy does not cover or apply to the practices of organizations that use our services on their websites, that Knack does not own or control, information collected offline, or to non- Knack employees.</p>

<p><strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Knack collects personally identifiable information when you register for an Knack account, when you fill out any form requesting information, support, or product and service information, and when you subscribe to our news.

Additionally, if you have chosen to receive email communications, you will receive our infrequent news and announcements.</p>
