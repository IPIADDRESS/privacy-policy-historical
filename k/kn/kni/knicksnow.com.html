</p>

<p>
	Here at the NBA.com Network, we are committed to

	<p>
	Before you submit any information to the NBA.com Network, please read this
	Policy for an explanation of how we will treat your personally identifiable
	information. By using any part of the NBA.com Network, including without
	limitation any official site of an NBA, WNBA, or D-League team, you consent to
	the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as outlined

	<p>
	You should note that the NBA.com Network includes certain "Third Party

	<h4>2. What personally identifiable
		and other information is collected</h4>
	<p>As stated above, the NBA.com Network does not knowingly solicit any personally
	identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Please review our
	<a href="#parents">Note to Parents</a>, if you have any questions regarding our Policy with respect
	to children.
	</p><p>
	With respect to persons age 13 or older, the NBA.com Network collects
	personally identifiable information required to participate in certain NBA.com
	Network features and transactions (e.g., in connection with membership
	enrollment, newsletters, games, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, purchases on
	the NBA/WNBA Store, etc.). This information may vary but will typically include
	your first and last name; mailing address (including city, state, zip code and
	country); complete date of birth; and e-mail address. In case you are making
	purchases online, a credit card number (including CID number) and expiration
	date may be required as well as shipping, billing and other information you
	provide to purchase or ship an item and other transactional information based
	on your purchase activities through the NBA.com Network. You may also be
	requested to provide a unique member name and password to access and use
	certain features of the site. You may elect to provide us with other personally
	identifiable information, such as in your profile, or when you post comments or
	content to our public forums. If you provide personally identifiable
	information in these ways, please note that such information may be available
	to the general public. In order to better customize and enhance your
	membership experience, we may combine the information that you provide with
	supplemental information (including mailing address updates and demographic
	data) that we obtain from public sources or reputable third parties.
	Information combined with personally identifiable information becomes, and is
	treated as, personally identifiable information under this Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
	The NBA.com Network also may collect non-personally identifiable information,
	including without limitation, Internet Protocol (IP) address, type of browser
	you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari), the type of operating
	system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows, MacOS), the domain name of your
	Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T), the type and/or "device
	ID" of handheld or mobile devices you are using (e.g., iPhone, Blackberry), the
	web pages you have visited within the Turner Network, sites visited before and
	after you visit a page on the NBA.com Network, your location information, the
	content you have accessed and the advertisements you have been shown and/or clicked
	on.  We may combine this
		and other non-personally identifiable information with the personally
		identifiable information that we have collected, including to customize a
		user's membership experience. 
</p>

<p>
	In addition, the NBA.com Network may solicit from time to
	time your opinion (e.g., to determine your preferences and dislikes in order to
	provide you with a better product or offering). These surveys are always
	optional, and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your
	status as an NBA.com Network user.

		from your interaction with our content. We may combine information which we
		obtain through social networking sites or applications with information we

<h4>3. How personally identifiable and other
		information is used</h4>
	
		<p>
		The NBA Family may use your information to provide you with services and
		information you have requested or products you have purchased (e.g., membership
		updates, e-mail newsletters, NBA/WNBA Store orders) and to resolve disputes,
		collect fees, and troubleshoot problems. The NBA Family also may use your
		information to respond to specific inquiries made by you (e.g., in response to
		job applications, e-mailed questions); to prevent potentially prohibited or
		illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Use; and to customize, measure, analyze
		and improve our services, content and layout. In addition, the NBA Family may
		use your information and/or supplement your information with information we
		obtain from other sources (e.g., partners, third party providers, public
		sources) to customize and enhance your online experience, including for online
		advertising purposes as described below, and to notify you about special
		offers, products, services, and information that we think may be of interest to
		you. You can opt-out of receiving commercial e-mail from us at any time by
		indicating your preference according to the instructions provided within the
		e-mails received. You may also change or update your personally identifiable
		information by visiting the membership area at
		<a href="http://www.nba.com/allaccess">NBA.com/allaccess</a>, or (if applicable) the "My
		Account" area at the NBA/WNBA Store.

		<h4>4. With whom the information may
			be shared</h4>
		
		
		<p>
		As indicated above, the NBA.com Network may disclose personally identifiable
		information to those within the NBA Family. From time to time, the NBA.com
		Network may also share personally identifiable information with third parties we
		have engaged to perform certain services in connection with the operation of
		certain aspects of the NBA.com Network, including to customize, measure, analyze
		and improve our services, content, and layout. These third party service
		providers are authorized to use this information only in a manner consistent
		with this Policy.</p>
		<p>
		The NBA Family has several sponsors and other business partners that can offer
		valuable products and services to our users. Except as indicated otherwise on
		the NBA.com Network, the NBA.com Network will not disclose your e-mail address
		to these partners if you have indicated that you do not wish to receive
		information, special offers or promotions from third parties via e-mail. From
		time to time, the NBA.com Network may share or provide non-identifiable
		information to these partners, and, in addition, the NBA.com Network may
		provide them with mailing address and other information so that they may extend
		offers to you. If you do not want your personally identifiable information
		shared with these partners, you may make such a request by sending us an e-mail
		at
		<a href="mailto:FanRelations@NBA.com">FanRelations@NBA.com</a> or writing to 477 Madison Avenue,
		New York, NY 10022, Attn: NBA.com Network Fan Relations. Your information also
		may be provided to an entity that acquires all or any part of the NBA.com
		Network's assets or in a merger or acquisition, in which case, you will be
		notified of such transaction and advised of any change in the applicable
		privacy policy. Further, we may disclose information in our discretion to cooperate
		with law enforcement or other government officials, or if asked to disclose information
		by subpoena, court order or other legal process.
		</p>
		<p>
		While the NBA Family is careful in choosing its partners and advertisers, we
		are only responsible for content on our own sites and for use of your
		personally identifiable information by us. All third parties associated with
		the NBA.com Network and/or to which the NBA.com Network may link (including,
		but not limited to, advertisers, sponsors and other Internet sites) with whom
		we share information have independent privacy and data collection practices. We
		encourage you to read the privacy policy of every web site that you visit. The
		NBA.com Network does not control this collection of information and cannot be
		responsible or liable for the policies or actions of third parties.

		<h4>5. Online Advertising </h4>
		<p>The NBA.com Network engages Turner and third parties to deliver advertisements
		on our sites and on our behalf across the Internet.</p>
		
	<p>
	Often the ads presented to you are
		based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored
		to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your
		interests, we will enhance your online experience.</p>
	<p>
	As part of this process Turner and/or
		these third parties may collect information about your online activities across
		the NBA.com Network, the Turner Network and other sites in an effort to make
		inferences about your interests and deliver to you advertisements targeted to those
		interests. The parties that may deliver such "interest-based ads" on our
		behalf include, but are not limited to:
</p>



<p>
	Turner: Turner serves advertisements on our behalf across
	the network of sites operated by Turner - which currently includes, but is not
	limited to, NBA.com, CNN.com, TBS.com, TNT.tv, TCM.com, AdultSwim.com,Golf.com,
	Fannation.com, TruTV.com, PGA.com, PGATour.com, thesmokinggun.com,si.com,
	ncaa.com, mmod.ncaa.com, teamcoco.com and NASCAR.com (collectively, the "Turner
	Network"). The sites included within the Turner Network may change from time
	to time. Turner collects non-personally identifiable information (including your
	IP address) and information about the pages you view and your activity on
	NBA.com and the other sites within the Turner Network through the use of
	cookies and web beacons. Turner then uses the information collected via these technologies
	to make inferences about your interests (for example, whether you are following
	the NBA Playoffs) for the purpose of delivering interest-based ads to you (such
	as an advertisement relating to the NBA Playoffs) while you are visiting other sites
	within the Turner Network.
</p>



<p>
	Yahoo!: Turner authorizes Yahoo! on our behalf to
	use web beacons along with cookies to collect these same types of data about
	your activities on NBA.com in order to determine your interests and to deliver interest-based
	ads to you while you are visiting certain Yahoo! network sites.
</p>



<p>
	Fetchback: TeamStore, which operates the NBA/WNBA Store site, also conducts a "retargeting" program through its affiliate, Fetchback Inc. ("Fetchback"), to serve ads on behalf of the NBA/WNBA Store site when you are visiting other sites on the Internet. To do this, Fetchback uses JavaScript tags and cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information (including your IP address) and information about your shopping and purchase activity on the NBA/WNBA Store site. Fetchback uses this information to deliver interest-based ads to you while you are visiting third-party sites across the Internet. Fetchback also contacts one or more third-party advertising companies when you visit certain pages within the NBA/WNBA Store site. As part of this process, Fetchback enables these third-party advertising companies to place a cookie on your browser so that Fetchback can be notified when your browser is visiting third-party sites on which Fetchback has the ability to deliver online advertisements. Please note that these third-party advertising companies are not authorized to use the cookies placed on your browser for any other purpose. You can view and delete these third-party cookies that have been placed on your browser through your browser's specific cookie management tools, as described above (for example, Internet Explorer users can view and delete cookies through the Internet Options tab within the Tools menu). Some of these third parties may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), and you can opt out of the receipt of interest-based ads from NAI members, as described below.
</p>



<p>
	Other Ad Networks: Although the majority of the online
	advertisements on the NBA.com Network are served through Turner, we also allow
	third-party ad serving companies, including other ad networks, to deliver
	advertisements on behalf of advertisers on the NBA.com Network. These companies
	currently include, but are not limited to, DoubleClick DART for Advertisers,
	Google, Atlas DMT, and Unicast. These third parties may also utilize web
	beacons, cookies, or similar technologies as part of their ad serving
	activities. To learn more about the use of these technologies by DoubleClick
	and Google for the purposes of serving advertisements, please visit the
	
	<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">Google advertising privacy page
	</a>.
</p>


<p>
	<b>Opting Out:</b> If you do not want your information to be collected on the
	NBA.com Network for purposes of delivering interest-based ads while you visit
	sites within the Turner Network or third-party sites across the Internet, you
	have multiple options for exercising your preferences. As described above, if
	you configure your browser settings to reject all "third-party" cookies, you
	will not receive interest-based ads delivered on our behalf. If you prefer a
	more limited form of opting out without rejecting third-party cookies
	altogether, you may opt out of receiving interest-based ads from some of the individual
	entities that deliver such advertisements on our behalf. Opting out of receiving
	interest-based ads will not reduce the number of advertisements you receive or otherwise
	affect your use of the NBA.com Network.

	<h4>8. The kind of security procedures
		that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information
		under our control</h4>
	
	<p>
	The NBA.com Network has generally accepted security measures in place to
	protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its
	control. The servers for the NBA.com Network that contain personally
	identifiable information are stored in a physically secure and climate
	controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we
	protect against data loss by backing up data, performing consistency checks,
	and restricting access to information on our servers. When receiving financial
	information (e.g., credit card number, credit card expiration date) for
	completing certain online transactions, including those in connection with the
	NBA.com/WNBA Store, the NBA Photo Store, and NBA League Pass, our site uses SSL
	or "Secure Sockets Layer," an industry standard security protocol.
	Other features, like email and contact us, are not encrypted. When providing
	sensitive information on the Internet, you should also look at your browser to

	<p><b>NBA.COM NETWORK NOTE TO PARENTS</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	It is the NBA.com Network's policy not to knowingly solicit any personally
	identifiable information from children under the age of 13. A number of interactive
	features on the NBA.com Network require registration to participate (e.g.,
	e-mail newsletters, membership). All registrants will be required to enter
	their full name, date of birth, e-mail address and, in some instances, zip code.
	If the NBA.com Network determines that a person is under the age of 13, based
	on the information provided during the enrollment process, that person will not
	be permitted to register for such features on the NBA.com Network. Instead,
	when a child under 13 years old tries to register, he or she will be directed
	to content which does not involve the submission of personally identifiable
	information. Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be
	able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on
	the NBA.com Network that involve the collection and retention of personally
	identifiable information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes) and they will not be
	contacted about special offers or promotions.
	</p>
	<p>
	The NBA.com Network works with (and may provide links to) third party sites
	that offer features described on the NBA.com Network. Registration for these
	features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third parties operating the
	web sites on which registration occurs. Such third party sites may permit
	children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in
	accordance with the privacy policies posted on those sites. The operators of
	those third party sites are responsible for ensuring that their sites comply
	with applicable laws, regulations, and rules. For more information, please
	review the privacy policies of each respective third party site.</p>
