</p>
<p>
  Here at the NBA.com Network, we are committed to

  Policy for an explanation of how we will treat your personally identifiable 
  information. By using any part of the NBA.com Network, including without 
  limitation any official site of an NBA, WNBA, or D-League team, you consent to 
  the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as outlined

    <h4>2. What personally identifiable and other information is collected</h4>
    As stated above, the NBA.com Network does not knowingly solicit 
    any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. 
    Please review our <a class="underline" title="Note to Parents" href="#parents">Note to Parents</a>, 
    if you have any questions regarding our Policy with respect to children.      
      
      
      <p>
      With respect to persons age 13 or older, the NBA.com Network collects
      personally identifiable information required to participate in certain NBA.com
      Network features and transactions (e.g., in connection with membership
      enrollment, newsletters, games, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, purchases on
      the NBA/WNBA Store, etc.). This information may vary but will typically include
      your first and last name; mailing address (including city, state, zip code and
      country); complete date of birth; and e-mail address. In case you are making
      purchases online, a credit card number (including CID number) and expiration
      date may be required as well as shipping, billing and other information you
      provide to purchase or ship an item and other transactional information based
      on your purchase activities through the NBA.com Network. You may also be
      requested to provide a unique member name and password to access and use
      certain features of the site. You may elect to provide us with other personally
      identifiable information, such as in your profile, or when you post comments or
      content to our public forums. If you provide personally identifiable
      information in these ways, please note that such information may be available
      to the general public. In order to better customize and enhance your
      membership experience, we may combine the information that you provide with
      supplemental information (including mailing address updates and demographic
      data) that we obtain from public sources or reputable third parties.
      Information combined with personally identifiable information becomes, and is
      treated as, personally identifiable information under this Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
      The NBA.com Network also may collect non-personally identifiable information,
      including without limitation, Internet Protocol (IP) address, type of browser
      you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari), the type of operating
      system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows, MacOS), the domain name of your
      Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T), the type and/or "device
      ID" of handheld or mobile devices you are using (e.g., iPhone, Blackberry), the
      web pages you have visited within the Turner Network, sites visited before and
      after you visit a page on the NBA.com Network, your location information, the
      content you have accessed and the advertisements you have been shown and/or clicked
      on.  We may combine this
        and other non-personally identifiable information with the personally
        identifiable information that we have collected, including to customize a
        user's membership experience. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, the NBA.com Network may solicit from time to
      time your opinion (e.g., to determine your preferences and dislikes in order to
      provide you with a better product or offering). These surveys are always
      optional, and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your
      status as an NBA.com Network user.

      </b>
       You also can engage with
        our content, such as video, games, applications, and other offerings, on or
        through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook, and NBA Family
        or third-party social media plug-ins and applications. When you engage with
        our content on or through third party social networking sites, plug-ins and

        content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about
        advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on)
        from your interaction with our content. We may combine information which we
        obtain through social networking sites or applications with information we
        obtain directly through the NBA.com Network or from other sources.</p>

    <h4>3. How personally identifiable and other
        information is used</h4>
      
        <p>
        The NBA Family may use your information to provide you with services and
        information you have requested or products you have purchased (e.g., membership
        updates, e-mail newsletters, NBA/WNBA Store orders) and to resolve disputes,
        collect fees, and troubleshoot problems. The NBA Family also may use your
        information to respond to specific inquiries made by you (e.g., in response to
        job applications, e-mailed questions); to prevent potentially prohibited or
        illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Use; and to customize, measure, analyze
        and improve our services, content and layout. In addition, the NBA Family may
        use your information and/or supplement your information with information we
        obtain from other sources (e.g., partners, third party providers, public
        sources) to customize and enhance your online experience, including for online
        advertising purposes as described below, and to notify you about special
        offers, products, services, and information that we think may be of interest to
        you. You can opt-out of receiving commercial e-mail from us at any time by
        indicating your preference according to the instructions provided within the
        e-mails received. You may also change or update your personally identifiable information by visiting the 
        membership area at <a title="NBA All Access" href="http://www.nba.com/allaccess">NBA.com/allaccess</a>,

        <h4>4. With whom the information may
          be shared</h4>
        
        
        <p>
        As indicated above, the NBA.com Network may disclose personally identifiable
        information to those within the NBA Family. From time to time, the NBA.com
        Network may also share personally identifiable information with third parties we
        have engaged to perform certain services in connection with the operation of
        certain aspects of the NBA.com Network, including to customize, measure, analyze
        and improve our services, content, and layout. These third party service
        providers are authorized to use this information only in a manner consistent
        with this Policy.</p>
        <p>
        The NBA Family has several sponsors and other business partners that can offer
        valuable products and services to our users. Except as indicated otherwise on
        the NBA.com Network, the NBA.com Network will not disclose your e-mail address
        to these partners if you have indicated that you do not wish to receive
        information, special offers or promotions from third parties via e-mail. From
        time to time, the NBA.com Network may share or provide non-identifiable
        information to these partners, and, in addition, the NBA.com Network may
        provide them with mailing address and other information so that they may extend
        offers to you. If you do not want your personally identifiable information
        shared with these partners, you may make such a request by sending us an e-mail
        at <a title="mail us at Fan Relations" href="mailto:FanRelations@NBA.com">FanRelations@NBA.com</a> or writing to 645 Fifth Avenue,
        New York, NY 10022, Attn: NBA.com Network Fan Relations. Your information also
        may be provided to an entity that acquires all or any part of the NBA.com
        Network's assets or in a merger or acquisition, in which case, you will be
        notified of such transaction and advised of any change in the applicable
        privacy policy. Further, we may disclose information in our discretion to cooperate
        with law enforcement or other government officials, or if asked to disclose information
        by subpoena, court order or other legal process.
        </p>
        <p>
        While the NBA Family is careful in choosing its partners and advertisers, we
        are only responsible for content on our own sites and for use of your
        personally identifiable information by us. All third parties associated with
        the NBA.com Network and/or to which the NBA.com Network may link (including,
        but not limited to, advertisers, sponsors and other Internet sites) with whom
        we share information have independent privacy and data collection practices. We
        encourage you to read the privacy policy of every web site that you visit. The
        NBA.com Network does not control this collection of information and cannot be
        responsible or liable for the policies or actions of third parties.

        <h4>5. Online Advertising </h4>
        <p>The NBA.com Network engages Turner and third parties to deliver advertisements
        on our sites and on our behalf across the Internet.</p>
        
      <p>
      Often the ads presented to you are
        based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored
        to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your
        interests, we will enhance your online experience.</p>
      <p>
      As part of this process Turner and/or
        these third parties may collect information about your online activities across
        the NBA.com Network, the Turner Network and other sites in an effort to make
        inferences about your interests and deliver to you advertisements targeted to those
        interests. The parties that may deliver such "interest-based ads" on our
        behalf include, but are not limited to:
    </p>



    <p>
      Turner: Turner serves advertisements on our behalf across
      the network of sites operated by Turner - which currently includes, but is not
      limited to, NBA.com, CNN.com, TBS.com, TNT.tv, TCM.com, AdultSwim.com,Golf.com,
      Fannation.com, TruTV.com, PGA.com, PGATour.com, thesmokinggun.com,si.com,
      ncaa.com, mmod.ncaa.com, teamcoco.com and NASCAR.com (collectively, the "Turner
      Network"). The sites included within the Turner Network may change from time
      to time. Turner collects non-personally identifiable information (including your
      IP address) and information about the pages you view and your activity on
      NBA.com and the other sites within the Turner Network through the use of
      cookies and web beacons. Turner then uses the information collected via these technologies
      to make inferences about your interests (for example, whether you are following
      the NBA Playoffs) for the purpose of delivering interest-based ads to you (such
      as an advertisement relating to the NBA Playoffs) while you are visiting other sites
      within the Turner Network.
    </p>



    <p>
      Yahoo!: Turner authorizes Yahoo! on our behalf to
      use web beacons along with cookies to collect these same types of data about
      your activities on NBA.com in order to determine your interests and to deliver interest-based
      ads to you while you are visiting certain Yahoo! network sites. In addition, TeamStore, which operates the NBA/WNBA Store site, also participates in a search "retargeting" program through Yahoo! to serve ads on behalf of the NBA/WNBA Store site based on your keyword searches on Yahoo!Â’s web search engine when you are visiting other sites across Yahoo! Network Plus - including Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Finance and Yahoo! Sports.  As part of this process, Yahoo! places a cookie on your browser so that Yahoo! can be notified when your browser is visiting a site on Yahoo! Network Plus on which Yahoo! can deliver targeted advertisements.
    </p>



    <p>
      Fetchback: GSI, which operates the NBA/WNBA Store site, also conducts a "retargeting" program through its affiliate, Fetchback Inc. ("Fetchback"), to serve ads on behalf of the NBA/WNBA Store site when you are visiting other sites on the Internet. To do this, Fetchback uses JavaScript tags and cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information (including your IP address) and information about your shopping and purchase activity on the NBA/WNBA Store site. Fetchback uses this information to deliver interest-based ads to you while you are visiting third-party sites across the Internet. Fetchback also contacts one or more third-party advertising companies when you visit certain pages within the NBA/WNBA Store site. As part of this process, Fetchback enables these third-party advertising companies to place a cookie on your browser so that Fetchback can be notified when your browser is visiting third-party sites on which Fetchback has the ability to deliver online advertisements. Please note that these third-party advertising companies are not authorized to use the cookies placed on your browser for any other purpose. You can view and delete these third-party cookies that have been placed on your browser through your browser's specific cookie management tools, as described above (for example, Internet Explorer users can view and delete cookies through the Internet Options tab within the Tools menu). Some of these third parties may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), and you can opt out of the receipt of interest-based ads from NAI members, as described below.
    </p>


    <p>
      Google AdWords: In conjunction with our media partners and agencies, 
      the NBA Entities also conduct "remarketing" campaigns using Google AdWords. 
      To do this, we authorize Google to use tags and cookies to collect non-personally identifiable 
      information about your visits to the NBA.com Network, which Google then uses to deliver targeted advertisements 
      to you for NBA products and services (e.g., NBA League Pass) based on your keyword searches on Google's search engine. 
      To learn more about how Google uses cookies in advertising, <a title="Googles Policies" href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/">click here</a>. 
      For information about how you can limit, or opt out of, Google's use of cookies for advertising, visit <a title="Google's Ad Settings page" href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Google's Ad Settings page</a>.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
      Adobe: We may also utilize Adobe technology, including placing pixels and/or cookies on your browser, to collect non-personally 
      identifiable information (including your IP address) and information about the pages you view and your activity on the NBA.com Network. 
      We use that information to perform site analytics, to tailor our website and other content 
      to your likely interests, or to deliver interest-based ads to you across the Internet 
      on behalf of the NBA Family or our partners (for example, an NBA-themed ad on a sponsor's website).
    </p>    
    
    
    <p>
      Other Ad Networks: Although the majority of the online advertisements on the NBA.com Network are served through Turner, 
      we also allow third-party ad serving companies, including other ad networks, to deliver advertisements on behalf of advertisers on the NBA.com Network. 
      These companies currently include, but are not limited to, DoubleClick DART for Advertisers, Google, Atlas DMT, and Unicast and ValueClick Media. 
      These third parties may also utilize web beacons, cookies, or similar technologies as part of their ad serving activities. 
      To learn more about the use of these technologies by DoubleClick and Google for the purposes of serving advertisements, 
      please visit the 
      
      <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">Google advertising privacy page
      </a>.
    </p>


    <p>
      <b>Opting Out:</b> If you do not want your information to be collected on the
      NBA.com Network for purposes of delivering interest-based ads while you visit
      sites within the Turner Network or third-party sites across the Internet, you
      have multiple options for exercising your preferences. As described above, if
      you configure your browser settings to reject all "third-party" cookies, you
      will not receive interest-based ads delivered on our behalf. If you prefer a
      more limited form of opting out without rejecting third-party cookies
      altogether, you may opt out of receiving interest-based ads from some of the individual
      entities that deliver such advertisements on our behalf. Opting out of receiving
      interest-based ads will not reduce the number of advertisements you receive or otherwise
      affect your use of the NBA.com Network.

      <h4>8. The kind of security procedures
        that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information
        under our control</h4>
      
      <p>
      The NBA.com Network has generally accepted security measures in place to
      protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its
      control. The servers for the NBA.com Network that contain personally
      identifiable information are stored in a physically secure and climate
      controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we
      protect against data loss by backing up data, performing consistency checks,
      and restricting access to information on our servers. When receiving financial
      information (e.g., credit card number, credit card expiration date) for
      completing certain online transactions, including those in connection with the
      NBA.com/WNBA Store, the NBA Photo Store, and NBA League Pass, our site uses SSL
      or "Secure Sockets Layer," an industry standard security protocol.
      Other features, like email and contact us, are not encrypted. When providing
      sensitive information on the Internet, you should also look at your browser to
      determine whether SSL technology is being employed (usually indicated by an
      image of a lock in the browser frame). In addition, only those trained employees
      needed to carry out our business functions will be authorized to have access to
      information on individual NBA.com Network customers.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can
      be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No
      data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While
      we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, we
      cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
      </p>
      <p>
      Your site membership account is password protected. We recommend that you do
      not divulge your password to anyone. At no time will any NBA.com Network
      employee ask for your password via e-mail. If you ever receive such an inquiry,
      please notify the NBA.com Network immediately at
      <a href="mailto:FanRelations@NBA.com">FanRelations@NBA.com</a>. Ultimately, you are solely
      responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your member names, passwords and/or
      other account information.
      </p>
      <p>
      Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on
      message boards, web logs, and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by
      others. If users post personally identifiable information that is accessible to
      the public online, the user does so at his or her own risk. Users accept that
      they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

      list. You also will have the option to correct any inaccuracies in your site
      membership account or other registration by returning to the membership area

      <p><b>NBA.COM NETWORK NOTE TO PARENTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
      It is the NBA.com Network's policy not to knowingly solicit any personally
      identifiable information from children under the age of 13. A number of interactive
      features on the NBA.com Network require registration to participate (e.g.,
      e-mail newsletters, membership). All registrants will be required to enter
      their full name, date of birth, e-mail address and, in some instances, zip code.
      If the NBA.com Network determines that a person is under the age of 13, based
      on the information provided during the enrollment process, that person will not
      be permitted to register for such features on the NBA.com Network. Instead,
      when a child under 13 years old tries to register, he or she will be directed
      to content which does not involve the submission of personally identifiable
      information. Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be
      able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on
      the NBA.com Network that involve the collection and retention of personally
      identifiable information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes) and they will not be
      contacted about special offers or promotions.
      </p>
      <p>
      The NBA.com Network works with (and may provide links to) third party sites
      that offer features described on the NBA.com Network. Registration for these
      features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third parties operating the
      web sites on which registration occurs. Such third party sites may permit
      children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in
      accordance with the privacy policies posted on those sites. The operators of
      those third party sites are responsible for ensuring that their sites comply
      with applicable laws, regulations, and rules. For more information, please
      review the privacy policies of each respective third party site.</p>
