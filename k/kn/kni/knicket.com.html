                    We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as if you choose to sign on to the Service through a third-party service. We cannot control third parties' use of your information.<br>
                    <br>
                    Knicket may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Knicket's rights or property.

                    We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Knicket services.<br>

                    Knicket may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party Ad Servers or Ad Networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Knicket. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Knicket does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party Ad Servers or Ad Networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Knicket to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or Ad Server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The Knicket Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.

                <dd>
                    Knicket uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Knicket or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Knicket will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.

                    You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case Knicket may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account.

                <dd>
                    Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Knicket does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register with the Service. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.

                    We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies.
