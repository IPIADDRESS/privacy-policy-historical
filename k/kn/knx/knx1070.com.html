<p><b>KNX1070.com</b> ("Site," "us," or "we") is the official website for
Radio Station <b>KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO</b>,
Los Angeles, CA ("Station"). 
This Site is owned and operated by <b>Infinity Broadcasting Corporation</b> ("Owner and Operator"), a subsidiary of CBS Radio Inc. ("CBS Radio").</p>


<p>Your privacy is very important to
us.  Because we gather certain types of personally identifiable information
("Personal Information") from users of our website and for various Station
activities, operational and business purposes, we feel you should know how we
collect, use, disclose,  manage, and store the Personal Information that you
may voluntarily provide us and the Personal Information that is collected
passively through the use of cookies or image tags on our website.  This
Privacy Policy is a part of the Site's <a href="/knxtermsuseagrmnt.html">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, which is binding
on all Site users. This Policy applies only to the Personal Information collected by this Station and
does not cover any such information collected by its corporate parent(s),
affiliates, or any other company, unless specifically stated. </p>



<p><b>If you do not agree with this
Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Station's online or off-line
activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information. 
(The type of Personal Information collected is listed below.)</b> This Policy provides information regarding your
choices to either Opt-out or Opt-in when your Personal Information is used for
various promotional and marketing purposes by the Station, Site, its corporate
affiliates, and/or our generous advertisers, sponsors, or promotional partners
(collectively, "Advertisers").  For example, for the Station, Site or our
corporate affiliates use of your Personal Information for marketing and
promotional purposes, we provide you with the right to Opt-out.  However, the
choice for sharing your Personal Information with Advertisers may be different.

<p align="center"><b><u>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</u></b></p>



<p>Residents of the State of
California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right
to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third
parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the
preceding year for direct marketing purposes.  Alternatively, the law provides
that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in
choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as
advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may
instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice
options.  </p>


<p>This Station qualifies for the
alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with
details on how you may Opt-out or Opt-in to the use of your Personal
Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.  Therefore, we are
not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received
your Personal Information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.</p>


<p>If you are a California resident
and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure
choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on
how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail).  You
may contact us in two ways. Send email to Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:knx1070@knx1070.cbs.com">knx1070@knx1070.cbs.com</a>
<b> .  Alternatively, you may contact the Station

collection, use, disclosure,  management and storage of your Personal
Information as described below.   We may from time to time, transfer or merge
any Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store

Information we collect online with information available from other sources,
including information received from Advertisers, or marketing companies.  This
Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full
force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site or a participant in

<a name="guide"></a>
<p align="center"><b><u>GENERAL PRIVACY GUIDELINES </u></b></p>



<p>We use your Personal Information
to provide you with the features, services, or goods you request and to respond
to billing and/or other such questions related to the Station or Site. We will
also use your Personal Information to notify you about updates, new features,
programming and activities on behalf of the Station, Site, or our Advertisers
that may be of interest to you.  (We explain below in the next section what our
policy is for the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information to
Advertisers.)</p>


<p>We may also use your information
for hiring, operational and business purposes, or to find out how we can
improve our Station and Site via surveys or online tracking mechanisms.   We
use aggregate Personal Information to help us to evaluate and modify existing
services and features.  We also use your Personal Information to develop new
services and features that may be of interest to you.  </p>



<p>We will not sell, exchange, rent, lease or otherwise
disclose your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to other
third party marketers or any such persons that are not associated with the
Station as Advertisers unless it is necessary to: 1) conform to regulatory and
legal requirements or to comply with legal process; 2) to protect the safety
and security of our users, employees, or property; 3) to defend the rights of
the Site or the Station; or 4) to enforce the Terms of Use Agreement.     </p>


<p>We will share
your Personal Information with our corporate parents, CBS Radio and CBS Corporation and affiliated entities
primarily for business and operational purposes.  On occasion, we will share
your Personal Information with CBS Radio-related corporate entities
for promotional and marketing purposes.  We will inform you when we conduct
cross-promotional events between our various stations or companies, and you
will have the right to Opt-out of such use. </p>


<p>It is also necessary that we share your Personal
Information and Sensitive Personal Information with our operational service
providers, the specialists that provide internal support to Station operations
and activities and/or for Site design, development, hosting and operations
including maintenance, management, storage and/or fulfillment of our membership
and e-mail clubs, various contests, sweepstakes, services, events and online
stores.  We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full
range of content, activities and membership services we bring to you and we
request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and
not disclose your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to
third party marketers that are not associated with the Station or website. 
Additionally, such providers are not to use your personal Information for their
own marketing or promotional purposes. </p>



<p>In the event
that the assets or stock of the Station, its corporate licensee or parent
company(s) are sold or transferred, merged with a different company or entity,
restructured, or subject to other fundamental corporate changes, we reserve the
right to disclose any and all databases compiled from Personal Information or
Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Station to such successor.  We
will seek to obligate the Station's successor to agree to the terms of the
Privacy Policy, as it may hereafter be modified, but cannot guarantee that we
will be able to do so or that the successor company will comply with this
obligation.  </p>



<p>We reserve the
right to collect Personal Information using any new technology yet to be
developed and to use such technology to provide new services and features to
you, as well as for marketing and promotional purposes.  Specific information
regarding your choice to Opt-in or to Opt-out to such use, or for sharing your
Personal Information with Advertisers, will be provided once the new
technology, service, or feature is introduced. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="collection"></a>
<p align="center"><b><u>WEBSITE COLLECTION, USE,
AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </u></b></p>


<p>Generally, you may browse this
Site without providing any Personal Information.  For certain activities (such
as contest and sweepstakes registrations, membership, awards points and loyal
listener clubs, music sampling and surveys, news/sports/weather alerts,
nominations for civic or Best Teacher/Coach awards, or registration for chat
rooms and message boards) the Personal Information you voluntarily provide may
include your first/middle and last name, home address, business address, email
address, telephone number, mobile phone/text messaging device number, birth
date, gender, employer or personal preferences, depending on the activity.  </p>


<p>Unless stated otherwise, we do not request contact
information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that
includes a domain name address (such as ".net" or ".com") as part of the
contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial email
messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have
first given your affirmative consent. We may inadvertently collect a wireless
device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or
register for a contest or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use
that contact information for sending commercial email.  We reserve the right to
respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a
domain name as such messages are not deemed to be commercial email and
therefore, are not regulated by Federal law.   <b>However, when "computer to
phone" commercial emails are prohibited by law, we may reject your wireless
device contact information when such information is submitted for certain Site
features or services.  We will attempt to notify you if we will need new
contact information.</b></p>


<p>For specific purposes (such as the
purchase of goods and services) we may request a type of confidential
personally identifiable information which shall be called "Sensitive Personal
Information" and is defined as any individual's: (1) social security number;
(2) driver's license number or state identification card number; or (3) account
number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security
code, access code or password that would permit access to an individual's
financial account.  This Sensitive Personal Information will only be used to
implement the specific activity or event it was submitted for.  We will not
share your Sensitive Personal Information with Advertisers.</p>



<p>However, more general Personal
Information will be used to implement the specific activity or event and will
also be used for the marketing of additional events, services and merchandising
for this Site and the Station.   </p>

<p align="center"><b><u>DISCLOSURE TO ADVERTISERS  </u></b></p>



<p>Advertising support allows us to
offer, free of charge, many great activities and services to our users such as
contests, sweepstakes and special events.  Therefore, we may also use your
Personal Information forthe marketing
of events, products or services of our generous Advertisers.  There are two
ways users may receive such information from Advertisers, either indirectly via
newsletters, email or direct mail from the Site, or directly from the
Advertiser.  We may use one or both methods depending on the activity and the
Advertiser.  </p>

<p>When we plan to share your
Personal Information with Advertisers, you will receive such notice on the
Site, in the rules of participation ("Rules of Participation") for the activity
or event, or via an email notice.  However, please be informed that our
Advertisers may not have the same privacy policies that we do. Therefore, we will ask you for your consent first to
receive marketing information directly from our Advertisers.  You will need to
check the "Opt-in" click boxes that may be located on the registration area for
the particular activity or event, in an email, or notify the Site's Privacy
Administrator at <a href="mailto:knx1070@knx1070.cbs.com">knx1070@knx1070.cbs.com</a>.
 However, if you do not wish to receive marketing or
promotional materials from the Site and/or Station, you will need to tell us so
by clicking the "Opt-Out" click boxes that may be included on the registration
area for the particular event, or alternatively, notify the Site's Privacy
Administrator.  Please note that this notification process is different than
the one for Advertisers.</p>



<p>We also provide you with an option to "Opt-out" of receiving
advertising and promotional email from us in compliance with federal law by
installing an Opt-out mechanism with all such email messages. You must use the
designated method in the email message to notify us of your
Opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other methods of notification
will be effective or timely.  Please be aware that we may continue to
contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes,
including follow-up messages regarding contests you have entered or other
transactions you have undertaken. By law, such messages are not
considered to be commercial email.</p>



<p>We are not responsible for removing your Personal
Information from third party lists or entities which you have previously
authorized us to share your information.  You will need to contact those
entities directly. </p>

<a name="cookies"></a>
<p align="center"><b><u>COOKIES AND IMAGE TAGS </u></b></p>


<p>The use of cookies is an industry
standard and they are currently used on most websites, including this Site. 
Cookies are a small text file containing a unique identification number that is
transferred from a website to the hard drive of a user's computer so that the
website administrator or a third party operational service provider may
identify the computer and passively track the user's activities on the website.
 Image tags work in conjunction with cookies and are small image files that may
be located on select pages of our Site, or with-in web-based email newsletters
that we may send.  (Image tags are also called web beacons, web bugs, clear
GIFs or single-pixel GIFs.)  Tracking is important because we can better
understand what parts of our website are used the most, when to launch new
services and how to enhance current offerings.  We may share the information we
receive from cookies and image tags with third-parties and our Advertisers in
aggregate form, which means that such information does not contain specific
Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information about any one visitor.</p>


<p>In short, cookies and image tags
collect a user's Internet protocols and server information.  Such data files
allow our Site to remember your web browser when you visit our Site and are
necessary tools for quick and efficient access to membership clubs, awards
programs and contests.  A cookie will not allow the Site to learn any Personal
Information (such as your real name and email address) or Sensitive Personal
Information that you have not otherwise disclosed.  Cookies and image tags
allow the Site to remember important information that will make the
Site easier for you to use and helpful in our administration of
various activities. We do not use cookies or image tags to collect other
Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information unless you give us
permission to do so.</p>


<p>You can choose to have your
computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent, or you can
choose to turn off all such devices.  This is done through your browser.  If
you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features at our Site that
make your Internet experience more efficient and enjoyable - like the features
mentioned above - and some of our other services will not function properly.</p>

<a name="children"></a>
<p align="center"><b><u>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY  </u></b></p>

<p>Although
persons of all ages may visit our Site and participate in activities that do
not require the collection of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal
Information, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect Personal Information
or Sensitive Personal Information from children under the age of 13. Except for
the limited circumstances listed below, we will automatically reject and delete
the registration or entry of any person we believe in good faith to be
underage.  Any false or fraudulent registration or entry from a minor will be
deemed to be ineligible and will disqualify the minor from the receipt of a
prize, benefit, or other participation.  </p>


<p>Except to meet
Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), or other regulatory and legal
purposes, we will not use, store, or disclose any child's Personal Information
to a third party without prior parental consent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="email"></a>
<p align="center"><b><u>EMAIL</u></b></p>

<p>We do not generally keep email
correspondence, except for those emails that relate to the on-air programs or
operations of <b>KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO.</b>  As
required by the FCC, if any part of your email correspondence relates to
Station programming or operations, we must place such correspondence in the
Station's FCC Public Inspection File, or make the correspondence available via
electronic file access at the Station to anyone that requests such information.
 Therefore, be informed that your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal

knowingly received from a child under the age of thirteen, will be disclosed to
the general public.  (Please see our <a href="#children">Children's Privacy Policy</a> section for
details.) We request that you not place any
Sensitive Personal Information in your email correspondence to the Station that
pertains to station programming or operations.  You understand and agree that
we are not responsible for Sensitive Personal Information that is improperly

<a name="shopping"></a>
<p align="center"><b><u>SHOPPING &amp; E-COMMERCE</u></b></p>


<p>If this Site sells goods and/or
services or provides auction services we will request Sensitive Personal
Information that includes your credit card, debit card or other payment
information. Alternatively, the Site may use a third party operational service
provider to conduct the financial transaction in a secured manner; the third
party payment will be accessible via a hyperlink from the Site and will be
solely responsible for all financial transactions and the collection, use, and
storage of your Personal Information.  The Site may  request additional
Personal Information such as full name, billing and shipping address, email
address and telephone number and any such information that is required to
fulfill your order and to communicate with you regarding your order.  Sensitive
Personal Information will be encrypted or collected though a secured Internet
connection generally via SSL or S-HTTP protocols.  Such Sensitive Personal
Information will also be stored in a commercially reasonable secure manner. We
may use your Personal Information, (but not your credit card or debit card
number) to contact you about future products, services and discounts from the
Station or to provide such information indirectly from our Advertisers, unless
you tell us otherwise ("Opt-out").  We will only use your credit card and debit
card number to complete the specific transaction you requested.</p>

<p>We reserve the right, at our sole
discretion, to save and archive any content of any nature posted to the Site

<p>We reserve the
right to monitor and edit any Personal Information about our users, including
information about the use of website activities and services, the contents of
users' email and messages for internal purposes, and when necessary, to
disclose to law enforcement personnel, and/or the employer and/or Internet
Service Provider of a user that is not in compliance with the Terms of Use
Agreement or Privacy Policy.  We will take such measures if we believe it is
necessary to protect the security, integrity, and operations of this Site or
Station.  Without disclosure of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal
Information about individual users, we may provide aggregate statistics about
our users, traffic patterns and related website information to Advertisers,
reputable third party vendors or marketing companies.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="3party"></a>
<p align="center"><b><u>ADVERTISING AND OTHER THIRD PARTY CONTENT</u></b></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover third party
advertising or third party content that may be present on the Site.  This Site
may provide banner and general advertising, in addition to other content
provided by our Advertisers or operational service providers.  Users may from
time to time purchase goods or services offered through, or otherwise
participate in or send messages concerning such advertising, promotions or
third party content offered through the Site.  Such correspondence,
transactions and agreements are solely between the user and the Advertiser or
the third party content provider and do not involve the Site.  Also,
Advertisers and such third party content providers may not have the same
privacy policies that we do and you are encouraged to read their privacy policy
first. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="links"></a>
<p align="center"><b><u>HYPER LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</u></b></p>

<p>This Site often provides links to third party websites that
could be of interest to our users, including the websites of our Advertisers. 
As stated in our Terms of Use Agreement, the Station does not own or control
these websites and therefore, is not responsible for the content, business
practices, nor operations of such websites.  Third party websites linked on
this Site may have different privacy policies and business practices than we
do.  The presence of a link to a third party website does not
constitute or imply our endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of the
third party content, goods, or services available through, or contained on, the
Site. By
use of this Site, you have agreed that you will use the
hyperlinks to third party sites at your own risk.  </p>

<p align="center"><b><u>OFF-LINE COLLECTION, USE,
AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</u></b></p>

<p>The Station also collects and uses Personal
Information by other means, via on-air broadcasts, telephone, direct mail, and
direct from members of the public. The various uses of such Personal
Information include, but are not limited to, contests &amp; sweepstakes, loyal
listener club registration, other special membership only features/events,
news-tip lines, job applications, listener complaints, and operational and
business purposes.</p>

<p>Except for contests &amp; sweepstakes entries, or
registrations for a loyal listener or other special membership features/events,
we do not ordinarily use your Personal Information collected off-line for
promotional or advertising purposes, nor do we share it with third parties for
promotional or marketing purposes.  If Personal Information collected off-line
will be used by the Station, its parent company(s), or corporate affiliates for
promotional and marketing purposes, you will have the opportunity to Opt-out of
such use.  If such information will be shared with Advertisers, you will have
the same rights as provided for the disclosure of Personal Information
collected online. (Please see the "Website Collection, Use, and Disclosure of
Personal Information" section.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="security"></a>
<p align="center"><b><u>SECURITY MEASURES</u></b></p>

<p>We conduct the
collection, management, maintenance and storage of listener or website user
information in a secure and commercially reasonable manner using acceptable
industry standards of security technology and practices (such as electronic
security systems and password protections) to protect against the loss, misuse
or alteration of Personal Information.   We also request that our operational
service providers take such precautions.  <b>KNX</b> 
databases are accessible only by authorized personnel.</p>



<p>However,
please note that when users transmit Personal Information over an unsecured
Internet connection, the Site is not responsible for the security of that
information during the transmission stage as your email or registration could
be copied or intercepted by unknown third parties.  We use a secured connection
only for the collection of Sensitive Personal Information, which is necessary
for the purchase of goods or services, but we do not use a secured connection
for other types of activities.  Therefore, you understand, acknowledge, and
agree that you transmit certain Personal Information over this Site at your own
risk.   </p>
