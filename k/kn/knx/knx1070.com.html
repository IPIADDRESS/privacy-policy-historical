<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Similar Technologies.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored in separate files within your computer’s Internet browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies are accessed and recorded by the websites you visit, and by the companies that show advertisements on these&nbsp;websites,&nbsp;so that they can recognize the same browser.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for Us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email.&nbsp;&nbsp;Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your&nbsp;computer&nbsp;such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>How Entercom Services Use Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Similar Technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Entercom Services use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies for the following general purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To help Us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and to save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting one of our Services. For example, if you register on an Entercom Service, that Service may use a cookie to identify you so that you will not have to log in each time you visit the Service.</li>
<li>To help Us customize the content and advertisements you are shown while visiting Entercom Services and potentially other websites.</li>
<li>&nbsp;To help measure and research the effectiveness of our online content, features, advertisements and other communications.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entercom Services may also allow third parties to place their own cookies within your browser in order to serve you relevant advertising online, to help Us measure traffic and effectiveness as described above, to provide you with access to social media networks, functionality and services, and to allow Us to conduct surveys and research in which you agree to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/">Google</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en">Twitter</a>&nbsp;place their cookies on Entercom Services to support social network integration and functionality and for use according to their respective privacy policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information, please see the&nbsp;Entercom Terms of Use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Web beacons are used to improve your experience on the Entercom Services, including helping provide you with content customized to your interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;They also help Us understand whether users read email messages and click on links contained in those messages so that We can deliver relevant content and offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our web beacons may collect some contact information (e.g., the email address associated with an email that contains a web beacon).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entercom Services also may include&nbsp;third party&nbsp;web beacons.&nbsp;&nbsp;These web beacons allow third party service providers to collect certain information such as your IP address, your browser type, and the web page that you visited before arriving at and after leaving Entercom Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;These service providers process the information they collect to audit, research, and report information about the Entercom Services and advertisements viewed on the Entercom Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third parties that use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to help Us with traffic measurement, research and analytics include&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics.html">Adobe Analytics</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.comscore.com/About-comScore/Privacy">comScore</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics,</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg_prs&amp;nav=1#Optoutchoices">Nielsen</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.confirmit.com/privacy-policy.aspx">ConfirmIT</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that We do not share your contact information with these third parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, authorized third party service providers may collect non-contact information about your visits to our Services with cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies that may be used to deliver advertisements or marketing tailored to your interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;To opt out of targeted advertisements on third party sites, please see the&nbsp;Managing Third Parties’ Behaviorally Targeted Advertising Cookies on Your Computer&nbsp;section of this Privacy Policy.</p>

The URL of the search results page may sometimes contain the keywords used in the search query you entered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the advertisements you see may be based on these keywords.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Mobile Devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Certain mobile devices provide various capabilities that can be used, for example, to identify the physical location of such devices. Mobile devices also transmit Caller ID data when a call is made or text message is sent. Entercom Services may collect, use, transmit, process and maintain unique identifiers, Caller ID data, location-based data, and other similar information when you use your mobile devices, including to provide the services you request, tell you about offers We think you will value and improve your experience on Entercom Services. Entercom Services also may require you to provide your mobile phone number to participate in certain services or features and that number may be associated with such information.<b></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Managing Cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Whether cookies are placed on your computer or mobile device is something you can control.&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of companies that use cookies to collect information about your online activities using web-based advertising are members of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative(“NAI”).</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The NAI offers a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads from member companies.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Managing Flash Cookies.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash cookies, also called local shared objects (LSOs), function similarly to standard cookies except that they are often larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile device by the Adobe Flash Player. In some cases, these Flash cookies can be managed through browser settings. Adobe also provides a means of controlling Flash cookies on its Flash Player: Setting Manager page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Managing Cookies on Entercom Mobile Applications</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Entercom may place cookies on your mobile device if you download Entercom applications (“Apps”).&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be provided with an opportunity to reject cookies before downloading an Entercom App, but by downloading an App, you will be deemed to have consented to the collection of information from your mobile device.</p>

For example, if you access an article about computers on one Entercom Service, We may show you a computer-related advertisement on another Entercom Service based on your apparent interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also may receive information from third parties about you and your activities on other websites for the purpose of serving relevant advertisements to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you access an article on a third party website about computers, We may use that information to serve you with a computer-related advertisement on an Entercom Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that We may share information about our users with advertisers so that they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on the Entercom Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, We may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also use technology, e.g.,&nbsp;Facebook Custom Audiences&nbsp;and&nbsp;Measured Marketing&nbsp;to deliver advertising to you on other websites based on the email address or other personal information you provided to Us or through the use of information We received from third parties. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of third parties, including those that may disclose information to Entercom.&nbsp;&nbsp;These online-advertising efforts across Entercom Services do not result in you seeing more advertisements, just more relevant advertising, and they allow Us to provide you with free content and services on Entercom Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope you value our efforts to show you content and advertising that more closely reflects your interests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Third Party Online Advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Some of the advertisements you see on the Entercom Services are delivered by third parties who also collect information through their own cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies about your online activities, either on our Services or across the Internet, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver advertisements that are tailored to your interests.
