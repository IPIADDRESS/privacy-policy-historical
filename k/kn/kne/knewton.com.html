    	<h1>Online Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Knewton, Inc. (“<b><i>Company</i></b>,”
    “<b><i>we</i></b>,”
    or “<b><i>us</i></b>”)
    provides access to information through our website accessible at the URL
    www.knewton.com (the “<b><i>Site</i></b>”) and we may provide the
    ability to use certain functionalities of the Site or provide services of
    various kinds (the “<b><i>Services</i></b>”).&nbsp; This
    privacy policy describes our information collection practices, as well as
    circumstances under which we disclose information collected from you.&nbsp; Our commitment to you is that we will
    not use or disclose information collected from you other than as described in
    this policy.</p>
  <p>In order to access and use the
    Site and Services, you must agree to our <u>Online
    Terms and Conditions</u> (the “<b><i>Terms and Conditions</i></b>”) posted on the
    Site.&nbsp; Persons and organizations
    with permission to use the Service are considered “<b><i>Registered Users</i></b>.”&nbsp; You may view portions of the Site even
    if you are not an Registered User of the Service.&nbsp; This privacy policy applies to Company’s collection, use and
    disclosure of personal information from Registered Users of the Site, as well
    as from persons who merely visit the Site, and this policy forms an integral
    part of the Terms and Conditions.&nbsp; Company has adopted and implemented this privacy policy as part of our
    commitment to protecting your personal information from misuse.</p>
  <p><b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b></p>
  <p>Company collects personally
    identifiable information as required to offer Services, as listed in the Terms
    and Conditions, as voluntarily provided by you in the course of correspondence
    or registration, and as otherwise identified below.&nbsp; In addition, we collect certain information that cannot be
    used to personally identify any user, such as anonymous, aggregate or
    statistical data. </p>
  <p>In order to use some Services,
    you may be required to complete the applicable registration form accessible on
    the Site.&nbsp; All persons who register
    are referred to as “<b><i>Registered Users</i></b>.”&nbsp; Some Services may not require registration.&nbsp; Company collects and maintains a record of all data provided
    through such registration forms.&nbsp; For
    example, individual users who desire to subscribe to the Service must provide
    certain contact information and financial information, such as a credit card
    number and expiration date.</p>
  <p>For some Services, each
    Registered User may be provided a unique username and password that enable
    access to the Service.&nbsp; We may
    track the use of those usernames and passwords in order to collect and maintain
    records of individual transactions conducted through the Services by Registered
    Users, and those records may be associated with each Registered User’s
    individual account profile within the Company system.</p>
  <p>We also collect and maintain
    records of information that you voluntarily provide to us.&nbsp; For example, we may ask you to
    participate in a survey, and may ask you to provide personally identifiable
    information, such as age, gender or other demographic data.&nbsp; However, unless such information is
    necessary for the Service or required by the Terms and Conditions, we do not
    require you to provide such information to us.&nbsp; By providing such information voluntarily, you give Company
    permission to use such information as described in this policy.</p>
  <p>We collect additional information
    through the Site and the Service that is not associated with any online account
    or registration information, and that cannot be used to personally identify you
    (all such information is “<b><i>Non-personal Data</i></b>,” in contrast to
    collected information described above, which is, “<b><i>Personal Information</i></b>”).&nbsp; Non-Personal Data ordinarily includes
    aggregate, summary, or other anonymous data, and may include, by way of
    example, statistics regarding popularity of particular pages within the Site,
    or information regarding types of Internet browsers used by Registered Users. We also collect Non-personal Data about each
    Registered User’s IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to
    administer our Site, but such IP addresses are not associated with individual
    account profiles or registration information.</p>
  <p>“<b><i>Cookies</i></b>” are small files
    placed on a user’s computer by a Web site in order to facilitate use of that
    Web site.&nbsp; For example, a cookie
    may contain information about a user’s preferences, so that the Web site
    automatically complies with those preferences whenever the user visits that Web
    site.&nbsp; When using the Service, we
    may create “<b><i>cookies</i></b>” on your computer for purposes of facilitating and
    maintaining your current user session, and may collect Personal Information
    using those cookies in order to enable Company to identify you in connection
    with the Service and to track use of the Service for purposes consistent with
    this policy.</p>
  <p>If you are under age 13, a law
    called the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) says that we must
    have a parent’s permission before we may collect and use your Personal Information.&nbsp; We will need this permission before we
    are able to create an account for you or provide you with any test preparation
    services.</p>
  <p>Note to parents of children under
    the age of 13: You are welcome to call us at (800) [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] to review any
    identifiable information we have collected about your child.&nbsp; If you desire, you may request that we
    delete this information and/or specify that we collect no more of your child’s
    information.&nbsp; Please note that we
    will need to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child
    to ensure that the person is in fact the child’s parent or legal guardian, and
    that a request for us to delete all personal information about a child requires
    us to cancel the child’s account.</p>
  <p>If your parents and/or another organization
    pays for or subsidizes the cost of your test preparation services, we may share
    your Personal Information with them at their request.&nbsp; This includes the content of your test preparation sessions
    (transcripts) and the written comments you leave in post-session surveys.&nbsp; If you pay for your own account,
    without the involvement of your parents or another organization, we will not
    share your Personal Information with them.</p>
  <p><b>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</b></p>
  <p>Company uses information collected
    from the Site and Service in several ways, as outlined in this policy.&nbsp; For example, we use Personal
    Information as needed to provide Services and to communicate with Registered
    Users.&nbsp; We also use both Personal
    Information and Non-Personal Data when evaluating ways to improve the Site and
    the Service.&nbsp; As further described
    below, in limited circumstances we may disclose collected information,
    including Personal Information, to certain third parties in connection with
    providing Services or as required by law.&nbsp; We will not use or disclose collected information in ways different from
    what is described in this policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>
  <p>We also use information collected
    through the Site and the Service to communicate with Registered Users from whom
    such information was collected in order to provide promotional materials about
    us and/or about our business partners and affiliates.&nbsp; However, unlike communications which are necessary to
    provide Services (“<b><i>Necessary Communications</i></b>”), promotional communications are
    optional (“<b><i>Optional Communications</i></b>”), and Company will refrain from
    sending that kind of information to you if you inform us that you prefer not to
    receive them, as described in more detail below.</p>
  <p>Company uses Non-Personal Data in
    a variety of ways, including, by way of example, to evaluate the performance of
    the Site and the general preferences of users, or to generate anonymous
    statistics for our benefit or for our business partners.&nbsp; Because Non-Personal Data is entirely
    anonymous, and therefore can never be used by us to identify you, this policy
    does not limit our ability to use or disclose Non-Personal Data. </p>
  <p>If we collect information through
    the Site and/or the Service that you provide to us voluntarily through online
    forms or surveys, through e-mail communications or by other means, we will
    treat that information as described above, as applied to both Personal
    Information and Non-Personal Data.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>As a necessary part of providing
    Services, we may disclose information collected from you as described in this
    policy.&nbsp; For example, we may
    disclose certain Personal Information about you to our third-party service
    providers, so long as they are only using the Personal Information to provide services
    to us.&nbsp; Under certain limited
    circumstances, we may be subject to legal requirements to disclose information
    collected through the Site or Services, such as, by way of example, to a court
    or a governmental agency, and our policy is to comply fully with all such legal
    requirements.&nbsp; The disclosures
    contemplated by this paragraph (“<b><i>Necessary Disclosures</i></b>”) are
    necessary if you wish to use the Service.&nbsp; As mentioned above, Company may use and disclose Non-Personal Data
    without restriction.&nbsp; If you do not
    want us to make such Necessary Disclosures, or to use Non-Personal Data without
    restriction, you must not use the Service. </p>
  <p>If you create an account on the
    Site by means of registration, we will respect your preferences, as you may
    indicate to us in your Registration Profile (further described below),
    regarding whether it is permissible for us to make disclosures of Personal
    Information other than described above, such as disclosures of Personal
    Information about you to our business partners other than as necessary to
    provide the Service.&nbsp; If you indicate
    in your Registration Profile that we may make such disclosures, those third
    parties may contact you for various reasons, such as for purposes of providing
    promotional information about products or services they offer.&nbsp; Unlike Necessary Disclosures, these
    kinds of disclosures of Personal Information are optional (“<b><i>Optional
    Disclosures</i></b>”), and Registered Users may access Services even if they
    indicate their preference that we not make such Optional Disclosures.&nbsp; We will not make Optional Disclosures
    of your Personal Information if you inform us of that preference as described
    below.</p>
  <p><b>CHOICE, OPTING-IN AND OPTING-OUT REGARDING OPTIONAL
    COMMUNICATIONS AND OPTIONAL DISCLOSURES</b></p>
  <p>Because we respect your privacy,
    we may from time to time provide certain opportunities for you to indicate your
    preferences regarding how we use and/or disclose information collected about
    you from the Site and the Service.&nbsp; If you are an Registered User, by indicating your preferences in the
    online profile your create, which includes your registration information and
    other information voluntarily provided by you (your “<b><i>Registration Profile</i></b>”),
    you will be able to inform us whether you wish to receive certain Optional
    Communications from us, as well as your preferences regarding Optional
    Disclosures.&nbsp; Please also note that, although we will
    respect such preferences that you indicate regarding Optional Communications
    and Optional Disclosures, information is nevertheless collected from your use
    of the Site and the Service as described above, largely through automated
    processes.&nbsp; Even so, we will treat
    Personal Information collected from you in accordance with those preferences,
    unless otherwise required by law.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>We do not maintain responsibility
    for the manner in which third parties use or further disclose Personal
    Information collected from you through the Site or Services, after we have
    disclosed that information to those third parties.&nbsp; However, we do require our third-party service providers to
    promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant
    services to us.&nbsp; If you do not want
    Company to use or disclose Personal Information collected about you in the
    manners identified in this policy as Necessary Communications and/or Necessary
    Disclosures, you may not use the Site or any Service.&nbsp; If you are merely a
    visitor to the Site but are not registered as an Registered User of any
    Service, please note that Company does not collect any Personal Information
    unless you voluntarily provide the same, so you do not need to opt-out
    regarding any such communications or disclosures.</p>
  <p>The Site contains links to other
    Web sites.&nbsp; Please be aware that we
    are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other Web
    sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every
    Web site they visit.&nbsp; This privacy
    statement applies solely to information collected by us through the Site.</p>
  <p><b>ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM YOU</b></p>
  <p>Registered Users may access their
    Registration Profiles at any time to update Personal Information contained
    within that Registration Profile.&nbsp; Subsequent uses or disclosures of information by us will reflect those
    changes, but we have no ability to update any information previously disclosed
    to any third party.&nbsp; Certain information is necessary in order for
    Company to provide the Service; therefore, if you delete such necessary
    information you will not be able to use the Service.</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    although most information within the Registration Profiles can be updated
    online, certain information within the Registration Profiles (e.g., credit card
    information) may only be changed by contacting Company directly and by
    following the instructions that Company may provide.</p>
  <p>The Site has security measures in
    place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of
    Personal Information in Company’s possession and control.&nbsp; For example, whenever the Service
    requests that Registered Users provide sensitive information, that information
    is encrypted with industry standard encryption techniques.&nbsp; When
    you are viewing a secure page within the Site, such as our user registration
    form, an icon of a padlock will appear as “locked” at the bottom of web
    browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, but the same icon will appear as
    “un-locked” when the user is merely “surfing.” We currently use an encryption program known as “<b><i>SSL</i></b>,” or “<b><i>Secure
    Sockets Layer</i></b>.”&nbsp; To learn
    more about SSL, go to <a href="http://www.ssl.com/">http://www.ssl.com/</a>.
    Credit card authorization requests are sent using the same encryption
    technology.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, access to Personal
    Information is physically restricted within our own offices, so that only
    certain of our employees are granted access to information as appropriate to
    perform specific jobs and tasks (e.g., performing customer service).&nbsp; Some
    information, such as the passwords of Registered Users, are also stored in an
    encrypted form within our own databases.&nbsp; We do not store billing information in our databases.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Please be aware that, although we
    endeavor to provide security for information in our possession and control, no
    security system can prevent against all potential security breaches, and we
    bear no liability for uses or disclosures of Personal Information or
    Non-Personal Data arising in connection with the theft thereof.&nbsp; Likewise, Registered Users are
    responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of passwords to any Services,
    and we bear no liability for access to, or use or disclosure of, Personal
    Information, if such access, use or disclosure arises in connection with the
    theft or disclosure (whether intentional or negligent) of a password.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about
    our security measures, you can click here to contact us at
    security@knewton.com.</p>
  <p><b>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</b></p>
  <p>If we change our privacy policy,
    we will post those changes on the Site so that users are always aware of what
    information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we
    will disclose it.&nbsp; Any such posted
    changes will be effective upon the date indicated by the posting, but in any event not sooner than 7 days
    after posting.&nbsp; We may from
    time to time desire to use Personal Information in ways that are different from
    the policies contemplated herein (“<b><i>New Uses</i></b>”). &nbsp;In all such cases, we will contact
    Registered Users by sending notice to any of the points of contact listed in
    their Registration Profiles.&nbsp; Your
    continued access to and/or use of the Site or Service constitutes your assent
    to, and acceptance of, this policy, including all posted changes and any New
    Uses for which we have provided notice.</p>
  <p><b>CONTACTING COMPANY</b></p>
  <p>If you have any questions about
    this privacy policy, please contact us at support@knewton.com.&nbsp; If you feel that we are not abiding by
    our posted privacy policy, you should first contact us at 95 Morton Street, New
