2015</h3><p id="basics" class="header">BASICS</p><p>Knewton, Inc. (“<strong>Knewton</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”,
		    “<strong>us</strong>”) is founded on the principle that every student in
		    the world should be able to receive a high-quality education tailored to
		    his or her needs. We understand that data collected from individuals,
		    especially students and children, is a sensitive issue and that it is
		    incumbent upon us to be as transparent as possible about our privacy
		    practices.</p><p>In order to understand our privacy practices, it is important for you to
		    understand, as further detailed in our <a href="/terms-of-service/">terms of
		    service</a>, that we currently offer two distinct product offerings. One is
		    our adaptive learning services that we offer through products offered by
		    schools, publishers, and other third parties (collectively,
		    “<strong>Enterprise Partners</strong>”) that are integrated with our online
		    adaptive learning platform (the “<strong>Platform</strong>”). We
		    specifically refer to the adaptive learning services that we provide to
		    users of our Enterprise Partners’ products as the “<strong>Enterprise
		    Service</strong>.” The other is an adaptive learning service and related
		    services that we offer through this Web site (the “<strong>Site</strong>”).
		    We specifically refer to the services offered through the Site as the
		    “<strong>Consumer Service</strong>” and refer to the Enterprise Service and
		    Consumer Service collectively, as the “<strong>Services</strong>.”</p><p>For the Services to be adaptive and to fulfill our mission, we need to
		    collect information from users; otherwise, the Services cannot be
		    personalized to each user. As stated in more detail below, in the case of
		    our Enterprise Service where an individual has not registered an account
		    directly with Knewton, all data that we collect from that user is
		    completely anonymized to us. There are, however, instances in which we
		    allow users of our Services (or parents, guardians, or other authorized
		    school representatives on behalf of a user if applicable) the ability to
		    create an account directly with us (a “<strong>Knewton Account</strong>”),
		    in which case such user (or parents, guardians, or authorized school
		    representative) will provide us with Personal Identifiers (as defined
		    below). In this case or receive, data we collect from users of our Services
		    may be linked to a Knewton Account and thus personally identifiable.</p><p>This privacy policy (the “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) describes
		    our practices with respect to the collection, receipt, use, storage, and
		    disclosure of information that we (i) collect and receive about visitors of
		    our Site and users of the Services whether or not such individuals create a
		    Knewton Account and (ii) create by linking data collected and received by
		    us from users of the Enterprise Service to a Knewton Account registered to
		    such user. Whether or not visitors of our Site and users of our Services
		    (individually “<strong>you</strong>”) have created a Knewton Account, by
		    visiting the Site or using the Services, you are accepting the practices
		    outlined in this Privacy Policy. Note that if you are using the Enterprise
		    Service, this policy does not apply to our Enterprise Partners; their
		    privacy policies that you have agreed to, not ours, govern their practices
		    regarding information they may collect or receive from you.</p><p>This Privacy Policy is organized into five general sections: (1)
		    <strong>from whom we collect/receive information</strong>, (2) <strong>what
		    information we collect/receive</strong>, (3) <strong>how we use and share
		    collected information</strong>, (4) <strong>what access and control you
		    have over collected information</strong> and (5) <strong>how we secure
		    collected information</strong>. Next to each section we have provided a
		    non-legalese summary. This summary is intended to provide transparency but
		    is not a substitute for our actual Privacy Policy.</p><hr><p id="glossary" class="header">glossary</p><p>Here are some important terms we use throughout the Privacy Policy. We
		    also define certain terms throughout the Privacy Policy. If you see a
		    capitalized word, come back up here first to find its specific definition
		    in the context of our Privacy Policy.</p><p><strong>“Child” or “Children”</strong> means anyone under 13 years of

		    Protection Act.</p><p><strong>“Enterprise Service”</strong> means the adaptive learning
		    services that we provide to users of our Enterprise Partners’ products.</p><p><strong>“Enterprise User”</strong> is any individual of any age who

		    Act.</p><p><strong>“Knewton Account”</strong> is defined in the Preamble as the

		    when you use and access the Enterprise Service) that we combine with a
		    Personal Identifier(s).</p><p><strong>“Registered User”</strong> means a user who has registered for
		    access to the Consumer Service on the Site and identified themselves as at
		    least 13 years of age when establishing a Knewton Account.</p><p><strong>“Usage Data”</strong> means the data we receive from a user’s
		    interactions and performance when interacting with the Services and

		                whether you are a Registered User or not. In almost all cases,
		                this will only be an email address. For visitors of the Site,

		                Identifiers from you that are relevant to the purpose of our
		                Services. For example, we collect certain Personal Identifiers

		                a Knewton Account we will typically only ask for your first and
		                last name, an email address, and in some instances, a
		                photograph. As part of our Consumer Service, you may also

		                Personal Information without verified parental consent and to
		                the extent such is permitted, we reserve the right to do so.
		                For instance, we may collect from Children an email address of
		                a Parent to provide notifications to the Parent, such as of a
		                Child’s participation on the Site; such notices will include
		                instructions to Parents on how to terminate the notices and

		                customer service inquires, we may collect Personal Information
		                from Children where verified parental consent is not required,
		                subject to compliance with the COPPA Rule (e.g., to respond to
		                an inquiry or request from a Child). COPPA permits other
		                collection and uses without prior parental consent, such as,
		                without limitation, support for internal operations and
		                protection of site security or integrity. We may also collect
		                persistent identifiers from a Child (e.g. a username, an
		                internet protocol (IP) address, etc.) when they visit the Site
		                (including the Consumer Service). Where we collect such
		                persistent identifiers from Children, we only use such
		                persistent identifiers for the internal operations of our Site
		                and for no other purpose.</p></div><h3>USAGE DATA RECEIVED AUTOMATICALLY</h3><div class="pr annotation-wrap"><div class="privacy-note "><p>As you interact with the Services, we will receive

		                    business partners. Because Non-Personal Data is entirely
		                    de-identified to us, and therefore cannot be used by us to
		                    identify an individual, this Privacy Policy does not limit

		                    Services or as permitted or required by applicable law. For
		                    example, if you are using the Services through an
		                    educational institution, we may share your Personal

		                    Information we collect from users who have created a
		                    Knewton Account. We will only do this if you permit us
		                    to.</p></div><p id="annotation-13">If you are an Enterprise User or are
		                merely a visitor to the Site but do not have a Knewton Account
		                or have not subscribed to our newsletter(s), please note that
		                we do not collect or receive any Personal Information from you
		                or allow you to share information with Educators, so you do not
		                need to opt-in or opt-out regarding any such Optional
		                Disclosures.</p><p>We may also use information collected or received about
		                Registered Users or to provide optional services and
		                communications. However, unlike communications described above
		                which are necessary to provide the Services, communications
		                like our newsletter(s), news about new features on our Site
		                and/or new products, or providing information to our Enterprise
		                Partner to allow you to link your Knewton Account with our
		                Enterprise Partners’ products, users will still be able to
		                access and use the Services even if they indicate their
		                preference that we not make such Optional Disclosures.</p><p>From time to time we may also decide that users may benefit
		                from us disclosing certain Personal Information to third
		                parties other than as described above. We will allow for you
		                (or your Parent if you are a Child) to indicate in your Knewton
		                Account if we may make such disclosures. For example, third
		                parties such as instructors or other authorized personnel of a
		                school or other institution (“<strong>Educators</strong>”) may
		                upload content to create an online learning experience for you
		                to access within the Consumer Service (a “<strong>Consumer
		                App</strong>”). You may request we share certain Personal
		                Information and Usage Data (either specific to that Consumer
		                App or more generally) to Educators in connection with your use
		                of such Consumer App. Where we allow this sharing of
		                information, we require as part of our Terms of Service that
		                Educators use such information solely to the extent necessary
		                to perform their services as an Educator.</p><p>Unlike Necessary Disclosures, all of these disclosures of
		                Personal Information are optional (“<strong>Optional
		                Disclosures</strong>”), and all users will be able to access
		                the Services even if they indicate their preference that we are
		                not permitted to make some or all of such Optional Disclosures.
		                We will respect your preferences and not make Optional
		                Disclosures unless you have opted-in to such Optional
		                Disclosures for yourself, or if applicable, opted-in your Child
		                under a Child Account.</p></div><h3>Other Disclosures</h3><div class="pr annotation-wrap"><div class="privacy-note "><p>Certain areas of the Consumer Service allow you to
		                    disclose Personal Information voluntarily. Also, if we are

		                    successor, but your information will still be protected by

		                Consumer Service, such as forums, message boards, and other
		                forms of public communication and interaction. Personal

		                users and companies and may appear on other websites or web
		                searches and, therefore, the information could be read,

		                to your Peronsal Information, unless you give consent to new
		                privacy terms. Any sharing and other transfers of Personal

		                (including analysis of that Usage Data in certain
		                circumstances) that we have linked to that account. You can
		                also remove Usage Data tied to your Knewton Account (or Child

		                selecting to de-identify such Usage Data from your Knewton
		                Account. Accordingly, we will permanently remove all Personal
		                Identifiers from that Usage Data. You can also entirely delete
		                your Knewton Account (or Child Account for your Child) at any

		                use the Consumer Service and the Services may be limited

		                preferences would no longer be leveraged to improve future
		                adaptive experiences. Should you decide to reactivate your

		                data will be recoverable and will be able to be used to
		                personalize learning experiences. However, there is the
		                possibility that deleting your Knewton account could result in
		                permanent loss of valuable historical data about your learning
		                preferences.</p></div><p id="protecting-children-under-13" class="header">HOW DO WE SECURE AND PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p><div class="pr annotation-wrap"><div class="privacy-note "><h5>Basically,</h5><p>no data security is absolute, but we take the necessary
		                    technical, physical, and administrative steps to secure
		                    Personal Information. You must also keep it safe. We
		                    protect your account by encrypting your password and
		                    Personal Identifiers.</p></div><p id="annotation-16">The security of your Personal Information
		                is of utmost importance to us. We have put in place what we
		                view as necessary physical, managerial, and technical
		                safeguards to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse,
		                and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
		                destruction.</p><p>For example, whenever the Services request that Registered
		                Users provide Personal Identifiers, that information is
		                encrypted with industry-standard encryption techniques during
		                transmission to us. When you are viewing a secure page within
		                the Site, such as our user registration form, an icon of a
		                padlock will appear as “locked” at the bottom of web browsers
		                such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, but the same icon will
		                appear as “un-locked” when the user is merely “surfing.” We
		                currently use an encryption technique known as
		                “<strong>SSL</strong>,” or “<strong>Secure Sockets
		                Layer</strong>.” To learn more about SSL, go to <a href="http://www.ssl.com" target="_blank">www.ssl.com</a>.</p><p>When we partner with outside sources to host the Services
		                and store data of our users in online databases, we
		                contractually require such outside sources to keep that data
		                confidential and to secure and protect it against unauthorized
		                access or use. Their use of your data is also strictly limited
		                to the purposes of storing such data and hosting our Services.
		                Wherever feasible, we will only use outside sources that have
		                privacy policies and practices as strong as our own.
		                Additionally, all Personal Identifiers and certain other
		                information, such as passwords, are always stored in an
		                encrypted form within such databases.</p><p>Furthermore, access to Personal Information is restricted
		                within our own offices, so that only certain of our employees
		                are granted access to such Personal Information as appropriate
		                to perform specific jobs and tasks (e.g. performing customer
		                service).</p><p>Please be aware that, although we use physical, managerial,
		                and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and
		                security for Personal Information and other Non-Personal Data
		                in our possession and control, no security system can prevent
		                against all potential security breaches, and we bear no
		                liability for uses or disclosures of Personal Information or
		                Non-Personal Data arising in connection with the theft thereof.
		                Likewise, users are responsible for safeguarding the
		                confidentiality of passwords, and we bear no liability for
		                access to, or use or disclosure of, Personal Information, if
		                such access, use, or disclosure arises in connection with the
		                theft or disclosure (whether intentional or negligent) of a
		                password.</p><p>If we learn of a data security incident that compromises or
		                appears to compromise your Personal Information, if required by
		                law, we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you
		                can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a
		                notice on the Site if a data security incident occurs.</p><p>If you have any questions about our security measures, you
