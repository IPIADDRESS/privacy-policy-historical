<p>The Parents Zone section of www.knex.com is committed to offering you, the 
  parent, helpful and educational information regarding building sets, K'NEX products 
  and the K'NEX website. This section of the site also offers you the opportunity 
  to enter contests and giveaways, and to enroll for email updates that will inform 
  you of new content and offers recently added to the <a href="/parentzone/index.php">Parent 
  Zone</a> and <a href="http://www.knex.com/customer/home.php">Catalog</a> sections 
  of the site. </p>
	<p>Please know that any information collected in conjunction with any of these opportunities will be strictly used for only the intention it was collected.  Never, in any case, do we sell or distribute information gathered to anyone, nor do we make our mailing lists available to anyone. We might, however, use this information in conjunction with a marketing partner, where we control when and how we use the information. Any information used in this specific manner would be in the categorized and generic format, and not individual names, email addresses, etc.</p>
	
	<p class="boldhead">GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY</p>
	<p>Please take note of this important information! Guidelines have been established by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (called COPPA) to protect the on-line privacy of children, to make clear what is advertising, and what, and how, information may be gathered from on-line users who are children. K'NEX is committed to complying with these guidelines and regulations for online privacy and security. We'd like you to review this web site to make sure you're satisfied with our approach and presentation. K'NEX does not want to collect any information that you, as a parent, are uncomfortable having your child submit to us.</p>
    <p>This web site is operated by: </p>

    <p>COPPA includes a child's email address in its definition of "personal 
      information."</p>
    <p>If you, as a parent, consent to our collection and use of your child's 
      personal information, as we describe in this Privacy Policy, it does not 
      mean you are consenting to the disclosure of that information to any outside 
      third party. To do so, we would first need your explicit approval to do 
      so.</p>
    <p>COPPA prohibits us, and any company, from conditioning your child's participation 
      in any activity on our Web site in exchange for the disclosure of more personal 
      information than is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity. 
      We agree with and adhere to this rule.</p>
    <p>You, as a parent, are automatically informed by email when your child contacts 
      us via the K'NEX Web site. The personal information we have collected from 
      your child via email contact is as follows: the child's first name, email 
      address, and your email address. We occasionally have surveys and contests, 
      where we may ask, in addition, for age, and gender. You have the right to 
      delete all of this personal information from our records at any time. You 
      may do so by clicking the "unsubscribe" link below.</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="http://www.knex.com/includes/unsubscribe.php" target="_blank">http://www.knex.com/includes/unsubscribe.php</a><br>
    </p>
    <p>Once we have received and processed your request, you will receive an email 
      notifying you that all of your child's information has been deleted from 
      our database. <br>
      We have indicated above what personal information about your child is in 
      our email database. The "unsubscribe" procedure will remove all 
      information from our database. If you have further comments, questions or 
      concerns about your child's personal information in our email database, 
      or any other concerns, please contact us at our free Consumer Relations 
      phone: 1-800-KID-KNEX (1-800-543-5639), or email us at: email@knex.com.</p>
    <p>Personal information is solicited only on a voluntary basis; it is not 
      required to visit the K'NEX site, and there are many things to interest 
      and entertain at the site without any registration. If your child indicates 
      a desire to receive emails from us regarding new changes on the site, contests 
      at the site, special access sections of the site, and new products, etc., 
      we will of course be using the supplied email address. You, or your child, 
      can terminate these email updates by using the unsubscribe procedure described 
      above.</p>
    <p>If your child has indicated in an email to us a problem with a K'NEX product, 
      or has a question regarding the K'NEX toy, or the company, or its people, 
      etc., we may categorize and collect that information in generic categories, 
      so that we can correct problems with the product or instructions, or address 
      concerns, on our website FAQ's. We do not keep that information based upon 
      the personal information supplied.</p>
    <p>Other than that, we will use any personal information you or your child 
      give us only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <p>â€¢ If we need to respond to an e-mail inquiry.</p>
    
<p>â€¢ If your child has entered a K'NEX on-line contest and won, we will need 
  an actual address to send the prize; notification will be sent to the parent's 
  e-mail address.</p>
    <p>If you or your child sign up to receive K'NEX information or product updates, 
      we will send an e-mail notification to the parent's e-mail address, with 
      instructions on how to remove the child's e-mail address from the e-mail 
      list, if you so wish. The surveys and contests, where we may ask for age 
      and gender of the child, tell us things we would like to know about K'NEX 
      users. This information is valuable in developing products we believe you 
      and your child will like. We're always interested in comments from consumers. 
      We use the generic, categorized data to help guide our marketing; too, so 
      we can be certain advertising and information get to the real K'NEX fans.</p>
    <p>Never, in any case, do we sell or distribute information gathered to anyone, 
      nor do we make our mailing lists available to anyone. We might, however, 
      use this information in conjunction with a marketing partner, where we control 
      when and how we use the information. Any information used in this specific 
      manner would be in the categorized and generic format, and not individual 
      names, email addresses, etc.<br>
      It is important for you to make sure your child knows that it is inappropriate 
      to send any personal information to anyone, including K'NEX, unless you 
      have given your explicit approval.</p>
    <p class="boldhead">ADVERTISING ON-LINE</p>
    <p>In regard to "advertising" on our site, we do have informational 
      catalog-style presentations. This is done to give you and your child a meaningful 
      way to evaluate the various sets, their contents, and possible interest 
      to your child.</p>
    <p class="boldhead">COOKIES</p>
    <p>When you visit the K'NEX web site, your computer and our server use a cookie 
      which enables your computer to easily move through our web site. We do not 
      otherwise use cookies, collect information with them, or save data associated

    <p class="boldhead">SECURE ONLINE PURCHASING FROM K'NEX</p>
    <p>Only those 18 or older can make an online purchase from K'NEX. The online 
      form requires the purchaser's real name, billing and shipping addresses, 
      phone number, e-mail address and credit card information in order to complete 
      the order. We accept only valid MASTERCARD or VISA credit cards in the name 
      of the purchaser. We, of course, submit this information to the credit card 
      company, which will use its own methods of verifying addresses and identities. 
      This information will be used only to process and ship the order and will 
      not be retained online after the order has been submitted. It will be kept 
      in a secure off-line database.</p>
    
<p>K'NEX's SECURE SERVER connection will safely protect Credit Card information 
  via the VeriSignâ„¢ system which you have probably used with other online 
  purchases. This information will be deleted from your browser after you complete 
  your order. Completion of your order can be done by one of the following: A) 
  Complete the Credit Card Processing page, B) Closing your Web Browser.</p>
    <p>K'NEX requires that online ordering be done by an adult 18 years or older. 
      Any customer wishing to submit an order who is younger than 18 years of 
      age must have the order submitted by a parent or guardian. These orders 
      will become the responsibility of the parent(s) or guardian(s) that own 
      the valid credit card used in the transaction. If you have any questions 
      regarding a purchase, please contact our Consumer Service Center at 1-800- 
      KID - KNEX (1-800-543-5639), Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 
      EST (US and Canadian callers only).</p>
    <p class="boldhead">OPTIONAL ORDERING METHOD</p>
    <p>If you feel uncomfortable submitting your credit card information over 
      the Internet, you may choose the items you would like to purchase online 
      and then select the "MAIL-IN ORDER FORM" option to print-out your 
      order. Once you have printed your completed order form, send it in with 
      one of the following payment options: A) Credit Card information (MasterCard 
      or VISA only) with Expiration date, or B) Attach a Personal Check or Money 
      Order made out to "K'NEX Industries" for the amount noted on the 
      completed form. We are sorry, but we cannot accept Credit Card orders over 
      the phone.</p>
    <p>Please contact our Consumer Service Center regarding any questions and/or 
      inquiries regarding the ordering of K'NEX Parts online and/or through the 
      mail at 1-800-KID-KNEX (1-800-543-5639), Monday through Friday, 8:30am to 
      5:00pm EST (US and Canadian callers only)</p>
    <p class="boldhead">SUBMITTING AN IDEA OR PICTURE TO K'NEX</p>
    <p>K'NEX doesn't accept models or ideas except for possible posting to the 
      Photo Gallery section of our web site. We can't accept ideas for any other 
      purpose. The problem we have, along with most other companies, is that there 
      could be confusion if we have independently developed an idea that you think 
      is based upon what you have submitted. We wouldn't want to appear to be 
      using an idea you have sent in, if we had not agreed with you in advance 
      that we wanted it. For example, if you had sent an idea for a crane, and 
      we had been developing one for months, or even years, you might incorrectly 
      think we had taken your idea! We, as a company, cannot allow ourselves to 
      be put in that position, as we are sure you can understand.</p>
    <p>So unless you intend to share your idea or model with us as a gift, please 
      do not send pictures, models, or any other creative material to us! Material 
      submitted will be considered as non-confidential and nonproprietary, giving 
      us the right to use it any way we wish. This may include making and selling 
      products based upon such material, licensing the material to others or posting 
      your ideas/photos on our web site<br>
      (By the way, you will see language similar to the above in the "legal" 
      part of most web sites!)</p>
    <p>1) Discuss this with your parents. They will need to fully read, understand 
      what we've said above, and complete and sign a Permission Form.</p>
    <p>2) If you still want to send us pictures, etc., click here for the Permission 
      Form.</p>

      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
    <p>3) Send the Permission Form, fully completed and signed by a parent or 
      guardian, and the picture, to:</p>
