      <p align="justify">KnownSRV Solutions respects the privacy and security     of its customers   and users of its website. KnownSRV strives to   provide   you with a   personalized Internet experience that delivers to   you the   information,   products and services that you need. In order   to achieve   this goal,   KnownSRV sometimes collects information during   your visits   to   our website. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>KnownSRV promises that:</strong><br>
- We do not and will not offer for sale, share, or lease any     information   given to us by you, except as disclosed in this privacy     policy   ("Privacy Policy").<br>
- Our Privacy Policy applies to prospective, current, and former   customers and users.<br>
<br>
We have prepared this Privacy Policy to enable you to understand   which     personal identifying information of yours is collected, how and     when we   might use your information, how we protect your information,     who has   access to your information, and how you can correct any     inaccuracies in   the information. This Privacy Policy is not intended     to and does not   create any contractual or other legal rights in or on     behalf of any   party.</p>
<br>
      <div align="left"><strong><h3>Information We Collect</h3></strong></div>
      <p align="justify">KnownSRV collects certain information from and     about its   users in three ways: (I) from our web server logs, (II) with     cookies and   (III) directly from the user. <br>
        <br>
        Web server logs: When you visit our website, KnownSRV may   collect     "Non-Personally Identifiable" information to administer the site   and     analyze its usage, such as:<br>
        - Your Internet protocol address (explained below);<br>
        - The type of browser or computer you use;<br>
        - The number of links you click within our website;<br>
        - The state or country from which you accessed our website;<br>
        - The date and time of your visit;<br>
        - The name of your Internet service provider;<br>
        - The web page from which you linked to our website; and<br>
      - The pages you viewed on our website</p>
<br>
      <p></p>
      <div align="left"><strong><h3>Internet Protocol ("IP") Address</h3></strong></div>
      <p align="justify">An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer     while using the   Internet from which Web servers can automatically     identify your   computer. KnownSRV servers gather your IP address and     the   webpage from where you linked to our website. Your IP address     assists   KnownSRV in administering and optimizing the website for you,       analyzing website usage, and diagnosing problems with the website.</p>
<br>
      <div align="left"><strong><h3>Cookies</h3></strong></div>
      <p align="justify">Our website uses cookies (i.e., small bits of text     that our servers   place into a file on your computer's hard drive).   We   use cookies to save   your preferences and login information, and     provide personalized   functionality. Cookies may also store Personally     Identifiable   Information (defined below) you have entered so that   you   do not have to   continually reenter the same information. You can     reject cookies by   changing your browser settings, but be aware that     this will disable some   of the functionality on the KnownSRV   website.</p>
<br>
      <div align="left"><strong><h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3></strong></div>
      <p align="justify">On some pages of our website, users can register to     purchase products   or services, receive personalized content and     participate in surveys or   forums. When you register, KnownSRV may ask     you for some   personal information, which may include, but not   limited   to, your full   name, postal address, phone number and email   address. We   may then   contact you with information about KnownSRV   products and     services.</p>
      <p align="justify">If you purchase products or services, we may also     request financial   information such as credit card or bank account     information. Any   financial information we collect is used only to bill     you for the   products and services you purchased. If you purchase by     credit card,   this information may be forwarded to your credit card     provider.</p>
<br>
      <div align="left"><strong><h3>Additional Information</h3></strong></div>
      <p align="justify">As a security measure and to ensure that our     website and computer   network remain available to all customers,     KnownSRV may use   software programs to monitor network traffic or to     identify unauthorized   attempts to upload or change information, or     otherwise cause damage.   These software programs may also collect     information regarding your use   of our website and computer network.</p>
      <p align="justify">You may also be asked to disclose personal     information to us so that   we can provide technical support assistance     and information to you. For   example, we may collect personal     information from you (such as an e-mail   address, system information     and problem descriptions) in order to   provide online technical support     and troubleshooting. If you choose to   correspond with us through     electronic communication (e.g. email, online   chat or instant     messaging), we may retain a copy of the electronic   communication     together with your email address and our responses. We   provide the     same protections for these electronic communications that we   employ in     the maintenance of information received by mail and   telephone.</p>
<br>
      <div align="left"><strong><h3>How We Use Your Information</h3></strong></div>
      <p align="justify">KnownSRV uses the information we collect to notify     you about   your account and to notify you about changes to the terms     and   conditions governing your use of our website, products and     services. We   may also use the information we collect to notify you     about other   products and services we think you will find valuable and     about special   offers. You may notify us of your desire not to   receive   notifications   relating to new products and services and   special offers   by "opting-out"   as provided for below. Our employees,   contractors, or   agents will at   times require access to your   Personally Identifiable   information.   KnownSRV permits access to such   information only for   business   purposes, such as administration and   developing our products   or   services.</p>
      <br>
      <div align="left"><strong><h3>Information Released</h3></strong></div>
      <p align="justify">KnownSRV may release some customer Non-Personally       Identifiable information, this website's traffic patterns, and   related     website usage information to our affiliates and reputable   third   parties   on an aggregated basis. We take measures to select   product or   service   providers that are responsible and afford similar   privacy   protections to   their customers. However, we do not make any     representations about the   practices and policies of these   companies.</p>
      <p align="justify">KnownSRV may share or disclose Personally     Identifiable   information with agents and contractors who use such     information on   behalf of KnownSRV or in connection with administering     or   delivering products and services on behalf of KnownSRV.</p>
<br>
      <div align="left"><strong><h3>SPECIAL CASES OF RELEASE</h3></strong></div>
      <p align="justify">Both Personally Identifiable and Non-Personally     Identifiable   information may be transferred to a third party:    1. As     required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, or as       compelled by a court of law  2. In the event of a change of ownership or     assets; and  3. To affiliated entities of common control, such as     subsidiaries and   parent companies. The use of your information by     these affiliates of   common control will comply with this Privacy     Policy.</p>
<br>
      <div align="left"><strong><h3>Contacting You Directly</h3></strong></div>
      <p align="justify">KnownSRV may contact you directly through the email     address   or other information you provide to confirm information or     purchases we   have successfully received from you. KnownSRV will also     contact   you to respond to your questions, to provide the services   you   request,   to manage your account, and/or to inform you of any   service     announcements.</p>
