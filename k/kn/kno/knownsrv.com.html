  <p align="justify">KnownSRV Solutions respects the privacy and security   of its customers   and users of its website. KnownSRV strives to provide   you with a   personalized Internet experience that delivers to you the   information,   products and services that you need. In order to achieve   this goal,   KnownSRV sometimes collects information during your visits   to   our website. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>KnownSRV promises that:</strong><br>
- We do not and will not offer for sale, share, or lease any   information   given to us by you, except as disclosed in this privacy   policy   (“Privacy Policy”).<br>
- Our Privacy Policy applies to prospective, current, and former   customers and users.<br>
<br>
We have prepared this Privacy Policy to enable you to understand   which   personal identifying information of yours is collected, how and   when we   might use your information, how we protect your information,   who has   access to your information, and how you can correct any   inaccuracies in   the information. This Privacy Policy is not intended   to and does not   create any contractual or other legal rights in or on   behalf of any   party.</p>

KnownSRV servers gather your IP address and   the   webpage from where you linked to our website.
