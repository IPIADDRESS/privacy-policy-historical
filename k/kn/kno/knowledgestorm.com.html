	<span class="header">Privacy Statement</span>

 	<p>Your right to privacy is very important. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you better service. That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information. Below is a summary of our policy.</p>

	<p><span class="subheader">Information Collection and Use</span></p>

	<p>KnowledgeStorm collects personally identifiable information from our Users at several different points on our Web site, including when a User registers as an IT Buyer. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p>

	<p><span class="subheader">Registration</span></p>

	<p>In order to use this Web site fully, the User must first complete the registration form. During registration, a User is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the User about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the User to provide some of the requested information, such as demographic information and unique identifiers, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.</p>

	<p>Registered Users must agree to the  <a href="/html/legal.php">Terms and Conditions</a> regarding use of our Web site.</p>

	<p><span class="subheader">Cookies</span></p>

	<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the User's hard drive containing information about the User. KnowledgeStorm employs cookies to recognize Users and their access privileges on our Web site. We also use cookies to track the usage of our Web site in order to enhance the experience for our Users. Users who do not accept cookies from the domain "knowledgestorm.com" cannot access Detailed Reports, personal research pages, or account administration areas of the Web site.</p>

	<p><span class="subheader">Log Files</span></p>

	<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track User's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

	<p><span class="subheader">Sharing Information</span></p>

	<p>When a User makes a request on our Web site to be contacted by an IT Provider or receive additional information for a specified solution, we notify that IT Provider of the User's interest and provide contact information. The IT Provider may contact the User to see if they are interested in learning more about the product, or if the User has any further questions about the product.</p>
	<p>In addition, KnowledgeStorm may share certain aggregated demographic information with our other partners. Such aggregated demographic information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
	<p>We will not sell our subscriber database information to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

	  <p><span class="subheader">Links</span></p>

	  <p>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that KnowledgeStorm is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our Users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>

	  <p><span class="subheader">Security</span></p>

	  <p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our Users' information. When Users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
	  <p>All of our Users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our information databases are kept in a secure location with limited access to internal staff.</p>
	  <p>If you have any questions about the security of our Web site, send an email to <a href="mailto:info@knowledgestorm.com" info@knowledgestorm.com"="">info@knowledgestorm.com</a>.

	  </p><p><span class="subheader">Special Offers</span></p>

	  <p>We send all new Users a welcoming email to verify password and User name. Registered Users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our Users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our <a href="#Choice">Choice/Opt-out</a> section below.</p>

	  <p><span class="subheader">Site and Service Updates</span></p>

	  <p>We also send the User site and service announcement updates. Registered Users are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the User to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.</p>

	  <p><span class="subheader">Correcting/Updating Personal Information:</span></p>

	  <p>If a User's personally identifiable information (such as a zip code) changes, or if a User no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that User's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by emailing us at  <a href="mailto:customerservice@knowledgestorm.com">customerservice@knowledgestorm.com</a>.</p>
	  
	  <p><a name="Choice"></a><span class="subheader">Choice/Opt-out</span></p>

	  <p>Users who wish not to have their contact information shared with IT Providers may opt-out at the time they request Detailed Product Reports from the IT Providers.  We will only share contact information at the point it is acknowledged by the user.</p>
	  <p>In addition, Users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our form has an opt-out mechanism so Users who register with us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.</p>
	  <p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to those emails, and including "unsubscribe" in the subject line.</p>

	  <span class="subheader">Notification of Changes</span><p></p>

	  <p>If we decide to change our Privacy Statement, we will post those changes on our home page so our Users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we would notify Users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Statement under which the information was collected.</p>

	  <p>KnowledgeStorm welcomes comments and questions on this policy. We are dedicated to protecting your personal information, and will make every reasonable effort to keep that information secure. Due to the rapidly evolving technologies on the Internet, we may occasionally update this statement. All revisions will be posted to this site. </p>

	  <p>Questions regarding this statement should be directed to <a href="mailto:customerservice@knowledgestorm.com">customerservice@knowledgestorm.com</a>. </p>
