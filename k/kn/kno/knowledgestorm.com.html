This means that when you are on a TechTarget Site and click through to that Content, you may be leaving the TechTarget Site and may be redirected to the site of the Content Sponsor, at which time you will be subject to the policies of the Content Sponsor. </p>
<p>TechTarget Sites also feature ads Advertisers. In the event that you click on an advertisement posted on a TechTarget Site, you may be&nbsp; redirected to the Advertiser’s website and leave the TechTarget network of Sites, at which time you will be subject to the Advertiser’s policies. Please note that there are two indicators of when you have left a TechTarget website. TechTarget takes pride in streamlining the “look and feel” of its websites.&nbsp; When you leave a TechTarget site, the look and feel of the site will change. Additionally, the URL of the TechTarget site that you were browsing prior to clicking on the advertisement will no longer reference the TechTarget Site. </p>
<p><strong>This Privacy Policy does not govern the use of, or disclosure of any information to Advertisers or Content Sponsors on, their website.</strong></p>
<h2><a name="WhatInformationDoWeCollect" id="WhatInformationDoWeCollect"></a>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

<p><strong>Member Information:</strong>A TechTarget goal in collecting Member Information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services, and to offer you opportunities to obtain other products and services from us and our partners. Because we derive revenue from advertising, collecting information is essential to keeping our services available to users. We collect Member Information when you provide it to us through the following: when you register on one of our Sites, subscribe to an e-mail newsletter, register for one of our events or access certain Content or through surveys, as well as when you register to receive a demonstration or “test-drive” software products. Several of the services that we offer on our Sites may require registration as a condition of use. Once you register with one of the TechTarget Sites, you are no longer anonymous to us. To the extent that we combine any Clickstream Data or Supplementary Information with the information provided by you, it will be considered to be part of your Member Information.</p>
<p><strong>Clickstream  Data:</strong>When you access a Site, a small file called a “cookie” is placed on your hard drive. If you register as a Member, TechTarget will use cookies to authenticate your identity when you visit the Sites, collect the data generated in connection with your clickstream activity on the Sites and to personalize your user experience on the Sites, including by serving and managing ads based on your activity on the Sites. In all cases, TechTarget uses cookies to track the Clickstream Data of Members on the Sites and to obtain non-personally identifiable information from Users, such as the number of visits to the Sites that a certain User has made, the movement of the User through the Sites, and the searches that the User conducts on the Sites. Please note that TechTarget does not collect Clickstream Data on any websites other than the Sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some TechTarget features and services may not be available to you if your cookies are disabled. We use electronic images known as "clear GIFs" (sometimes called "transparent GIFs", "Web bugs", “pixel tags” or "beacons") that allow us to track general user traffic patterns. TechTarget also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you accessed. Although our Sites currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed in the section entitled<strong><em>&nbsp;Analytics and Online Behavioral Advertising</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Clickstream Data:</strong>When you visit the Sites, we may also allow our third party partners to place their own cookies on your computer in order to serve you with relevant advertising online. This third party cookie may transfer non-personally identifiable information to the third party partner in order for them to track your activity when you visit the Sites and on sites outside the TechTarget network for purposes of serving you ads on topics in which you have a demonstrated interest based on your Clickstream Data; please note that we do not share any personally identifiable Member Information with these third parties and we can only access cookies that we set on your computer, not the cookies sent to you by other companies. Also, when you leave the TechTarget network of Sites by clicking on Sponsored Content or advertising, these third parties may place cookies or clear GIFs on your computer. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use and disclosure of any information collected by third parties, such as through cookies or clear GIFs, when you visit their web sites or by third parties regarding your clickstream activity on sites other than TechTarget’s network of Sites.</p>
<p>In addition to the disclosure to third parties as described above, TechTarget has contractual arrangements with certain Service Providers under which these Service Providers agree not to disclose any information we provide to them. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, the Service Provider is to be considered to be the same as TechTarget.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics  and Online Behavioral Advertising:</strong>We partner with certain third parties to collect the non-personal information discussed above and to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting. These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular, the Sites use<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank"><strong>&nbsp;Google Analytics&nbsp;</strong></a>to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed above. </p>
<p>You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The Sites also enable third-party tracking mechanisms to collect your non-personal information for use in online behavioral advertising. For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Sites to target online ads for TechTarget to you on non-TechTarget websites. In addition, our third-party advertising networks might use information about your use of the Sites to help target specific technology-related or other non-TechTarget advertisements to you based on your online behavior. For information about behavioral advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising" target="_blank"><strong>Network Advertising Initiative website</strong></a>&nbsp;or the<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank"><strong>&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance website</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this Policy. If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer, you may set your browser to block cookies. Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank"><strong>opting out here</strong></a>, or of companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance program by<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank"><strong>&nbsp;opting out here</strong></a>. Although our Sites currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed above.</p>

<p><strong>Third   Party Personal Information: </strong>The Sites include an “email a friend” feature, which allows a User to email Content to a third party; we only use the email address of that person for purposes of emailing that Content to that person.</p>
<p><strong>User Generated Content:</strong> Some Sites feature user generated content in the form of a user review section or forum communities. In order to interact in these forums, a User must first complete the applicable registration form and, in some case, terms of service for the Site. The information provided by the User may be displayed in the User's public profile in our forums and can be viewed by all visitors to this Site. However, to ensure total privacy of our Users, we do not display any User e-mail addresses.</p>

<p><strong>User System Information: </strong>TechTarget’s webcast application provides a system test that determines whether you can view a webcast from your computer. This information is used to optimize the viewing experience and to troubleshoot webcast viewing problems. We do not collect or retain personally identifiable information in conducting these tests.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction Information:</strong> When you order paid Content from the Sites or register to attend a paid in-person event on the Sites, we ask you to complete an order form that requests certain information from you, including a credit card number and expiration date and general contact details. We do not retain the credit card information.</p>

You should contact these partners directly if you have any questions about their use of this information.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Aggregated Information:</strong> We provide summary reports, based on our analysis of Clickstream Data, which may include a description of your level of activity on our Sites, as well as activity related to editorial and vendor content. For example, a summary report may include a statement similar to the following "3,000 people looked at the xyz white paper this week and, of those 3,000 people, 60% clicked through to read the full white paper." Information provided in summary reports is aggregated and does not disclose any Member Information. TechTarget may also disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, “25% of our users are interested in Networking”) to our customers, prospective customers and partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.</p>
