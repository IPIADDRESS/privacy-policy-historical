</p><hr>
<p>For the convenience and security of our subscribers and our company, Knowledge 
  Hound's 'One Smart Puppy' newsletter subscriber list is hosted and managed by 
  <a href="http://www.mailermailer.com/">MailerMailer.com</a>.</p>
<h4>Newsletter Subscriber List Information Collection</h4>
<p>We collect 
  the information that is requested on the newsletter signup form. We may collect
  the domain name or IP address of
  the subscriber as proof of signup in the event that we are accused of sending
  unsolicited email. We may collect clickstream information, which tells us what
  you have clicked on. (For our Website Privacy Policy, click <a href="../privacy.htm">here</a>.)
   We may collect information volunteered by you in the form of survey information.
  
  Newsletters may include information from third party providers
  for products and services which may be advertised or promoted within the newsletter.
  The privacy policies of those third-party provider sites govern the method
  by which
  they collect and use information.</p>
<h4>Use Of Information Collected</h4>
<p>The information we collect may be used to create an aggregate demographic
  profile of our user base so that we can improve content and services and provide
  aggregate
  information to potential advertisers (no individual information is provided
  to any third-party without your consent), to customize the content and/or layout
  of our newsletter, to notify you about updates or disruptions to our web
  site and/or services and to send you our newsletter. We may share
  information with another company in the event that we merge with or are acquired
  by another company. Upon request, we will
  provide you with the information (e.g., email address, name, etc.) that we
  maintain
  about you.</p>
<h4>To Unsubscribe</h4>
<p>If you subscribed to our newsletter but do not want to receive it in 
  the future, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions contained in the newsletter,
  which includes an individualized link to your subscription information.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>We and MailerMailer.com, providers of the email list management service used
  for this list, strive to maintain appropriate security measures in our respective
  physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information
  that we have collected from you. Although we
  and MailerMailer take reasonable measures to secure our data, we cannot guarantee
  that the measures taken are or will remain adequate.</p>
<h4>Changes to Newsletter Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>In the unlikely event that we decide to use customer information for new,
  unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this Newsletter Privacy Policy
  notice, we
  will post the policy changes
  to this Newsletter Privacy Policy page to notify you of these changes and provide
   you with the ability to opt out of our list. If you are concerned about how
  
  your information is used, you should check this Newsletter Privacy Policy page
   periodically.</p>
<h4>Abuse</h4>
<p> To report any abuse or violations of this Newsletter Privacy Policy, please 
  send an email to <a href="mailto:abuse@mailermailer.com">abuse@mailermailer.com</a> and attach an 
  unedited copy of the email message that you feel was sent to you in error or 
  without your permission. Include all header information so that MailerMailer.com 
  can trace origin of the message. Also include any notes or other information 
  that you feel are pertinent.</p>
