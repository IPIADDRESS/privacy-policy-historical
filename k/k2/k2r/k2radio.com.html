I have yet to graduate from the College of Hard Knocks.\r\n\r\nAvocations and experiences include outdoorsy stuff, traveling by train, tutoring at Casper College's Writing Center, herding a cat named Noir, reading, writing including a couple of published books, acting at Stage III Community Theatre, driving a stock car, dancing, and driving my 1948 MG TC -- \"the sports car America loved first.\" Musical interests range from classical to blues to rock. I fly the flag on my 1919-era house, listen to the Clash, cook, collect antiques, and nurture a curiosity about what's around the next bend.\r\n\r\nI look forward to reporting again on our wonderful, wild and sometimes wacky Wyoming.\r\n\r\nSend me an email at <a href=\"mailto:tom.morton@townsquaremedia.com\">tom.morton@townsquaremedia.com</a> .","thumbnail":"http://k2radio.com/files/2014/03/Tom-Headshot.jpg","url":"http://k2radio.com/author/tommorton/"}},"alternateData":{"_townsquare_media_url":"","dynamic-lead-title":"","dynamic-lead-excerpt":"","dynamic-lead-link-url":"","dynamic-lead-image":"","dynamic-lead-video":"","ts3_alternate":{"title":"","excerpt":"","link-url":"","image":""}}}},"442579":{"postid":"442579","sortdate":"2017-06-28T01:56:57.000Z","data":{"mainData":{"postType":"post","caption":"Courtesy: Stephanie Frank","thumbnail":"http://k2radio.com/files/2017/06/roof.jpg","postDateGmt":"2017-06-28 01:56:57 +0000","title":"Casper Family Aquatic Center Loses Part of Roof","url":"http://k2radio.com/casper-aquatic-center-loses-part-of-roof/","id":442579,"carbonMeta":{"widePromotion":false,"isGallery":false},"excerpt":"The extent of the damage is unknown, but some of it is apparent from the street.

I was in Berlin when the wall came down, the Middle East during the Gulf War, back to Germany for reunification, and Israel 3 times during the peace talks. I've interviewed every President from Ford to George W. Bush, and broadcast from the cockpit of a B-17, a MiG fighter and the deck of the QE2. I've been a News and Program Director and part owner in both radio and TV, and am thrilled to be the new Regional News Director for Townsquare Media in Wyoming.
