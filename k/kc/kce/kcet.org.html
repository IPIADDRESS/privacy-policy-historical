<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. What Information Does the Site Collect?</strong></p>

<p>We may use various methods and technologies to collect and/or store Usage Information ("<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>").

A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

This includes Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the content that has been delivered to you.</p>

<p>There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site. Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Site, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.

A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<ul>

		<li>Certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.</li>
		<li><strong><em>Cookies.</em></strong>&nbsp;A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies.

<p><strong style="font-size: 1em;">5.&nbsp;<a name="priv5"></a>Ads and Information About You</strong></p>

<p>We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on the Site or across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities across the Internet and mobile media ("<strong>Behavioral Ads</strong>"). Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be interested. If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads on the Site, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below. Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information via a Device Identifier. These third party technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.</p>

<p>Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices, and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.</p>

<p>Some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is&nbsp;<a href="#privchart">available here</a>. Further, while sites use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("<strong>NAI</strong>") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance ("<strong>DAA</strong>") website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed</a>.
