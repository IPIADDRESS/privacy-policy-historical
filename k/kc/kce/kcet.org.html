<p><strong>1. What Information Does the Site Collect?</strong></p>

<p>We may use various methods and technologies to collect and/or store Usage Information ("<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>"). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter, or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Strictly Necessary.</em></strong>&nbsp;We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Site, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security, or allow you to make use of Site functionality.</p>

<p><strong><em>Performance-Related.</em></strong>&nbsp;We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Site, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products, or services offered through the Site.</p>

<p><strong><em>Functionality-Related.</em></strong>&nbsp;We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Site, including identifying you when you visit our Site or keeping track of your specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on our Site.</p>

<p><strong><em>Targeting-Related.</em></strong>&nbsp;We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content relevant to your interests on our Service and third-party services based on how you interact with our content. This includes Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the content that has been delivered to you.</p>

<p>There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site. Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Site, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third-party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Site and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><strong><a name="priv1a"></a>Information You Provide to Us</strong>

	<p>On the Site, we may ask you to provide certain categories of information such as: (1) personality identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, email address, home address, date of birth, and phone number ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>"); and (2) demographic information, such as information about your gender ("<strong>Demographic Information</strong>"). KCETLink may collect Personal Information and Demographic Information through various forms and in various places on the Site, including through its membership subscriptions, pledges of financial support, and/or services which require subscriptions such as an email or postal newsletter ("<strong>Subscription Activities</strong>"). On occasion, we may hold certain auctions, contests, sweepstakes, or other promotional events (collectively, "<strong>Promotions</strong>") and, in connection with those Promotions, we may request that partcipants provide Personal Information. We may also collect Personal Information and Demographic Information through various forms and in various places on the Site, including if you sign-up for a membership, through "contact us" forms, or when you otherwise interact with the KCETLink Sites. If we combine Demographic Information with the Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Site, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong><a name="priv1b"></a>Information We Collect and Store As You Access and Use the Site</strong>
	<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Site, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Site ("<strong>Usage Information</strong>"). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, or other device (a "<strong>Device</strong>") whenever you visit or interact with our Site. Like all web services, the web server(s) of KCETLink Sites automatically create log files for each visitor who accesses the KCETLink Sites. These "access logs" allow us to make the KCETLink Sites more useful to our visitors. The access logs do NOT record a visitor's name, address, phone number or credit card numbers. Rather, they contain some or all of the following Usage Information:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>We may use various methods and technologies to collect and/or store Usage Information ("<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>"). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter, or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Site, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;</li>
		<li>Your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);</li>
		<li>The URL that referred you to our Site;</li>
		<li>The areas within our Site that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;</li>
		<li>Your Device location;</li>
		<li>Your Device characteristics; and</li>
		<li>Certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.</li>
		<li><strong><em>Cookies.</em></strong>&nbsp;A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's web site&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/">www.adobe.com</a>. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Site may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Site your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</li>
		<li><strong><em>Web Beacons.</em></strong>&nbsp;Small graphic images or other web programming code called "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our Site's pages and messages. Web beacons may be inviisble to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular or links were actually viewed.</li>
		<li><strong><em>Embedded Scripts.</em></strong>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</li>
		<li><strong><em>Browser Fingerprinting.</em></strong>Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.</li>
		<li><strong><em>Recognition Technologies.</em></strong>Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user).</li>
		<li><strong><em>ETag, or entity tag.</em></strong>A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash and/or HTML5 cookies.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong><a name="priv1c"></a>Information Third Parties Provide About You</strong>
	<p>We may receive information about you from friends and others that use the Site, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Site. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Site with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. For example, KCETLink may exchange with, or rent to/from, a range of organizations the names and mailing addresses of individuals provided that the organizations agreed in writing to use KCETLink provided Personal Information for the sole purpose of mailing individuals information about the organization's products/services and fundraising solicitations; you may instruct KCETLink not to share your Personal Information with such organizations by following the directions listed below under&nbsp;<a href="#priv7">Section 7: "How Do I Change My Information and Communication Preferences?"</a>. To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with Personal Information we collect on the Site, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong><a name="priv1d"></a>Interactions with Third Party Sites</strong>
	<p>The Site may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Site and your account on a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, we may provide third-party sites' interfaces or links on the Site to facilitate your sending a communication from the Site. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, Tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties' practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. KCETLink may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Site.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong><a name="priv1e"></a>Information You Provide About a Third Party</strong>
	<p>You may send someone else a communication from the Site, such as sending an invitation to a friend. If so, the information you provide (names, email addresses, mobile number, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Site, your email address, mobile number, name, or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).</p>

In addition, third parties may store, collect or otherwise have access to your information when you interact with their Tracking Technologies, content, tools apps or ads on our Site or link to them from our Site. This may include using third party tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or other third party posting or content sharing tools. It may also include ordering or purchasing products from third parties through us where we indicate that the third party rather than us is the seller. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review such third party privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to requesting information from or otherwise interacting with them.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong><a name="priv3b"></a>Third Parties Providing Services on our Behalf</strong>
	<p>We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Site, such as hosting the Site and processing credit cards, designing and/or operating the Site's features, tracking the Site's activities and analytics, and enabling us to send you special offers or perform other administrative services. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. Third-party analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Information, about you.

However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices and information as to their use of your information; to the extent we have been informed, please&nbsp;<a href="#privchart">click here</a>&nbsp;to learn more of the availability of such choices.

	<li><strong><a name="priv3e"></a>Co-branded Areas</strong>
	<p>Certain areas of the Site may be provided to you in association with third parties ("<strong>Co-Branded Areas</strong>") such as our donation partners, and may require you to disclose Personal Information to them.

If this law applies to you, you may obtain the categories of personal information shared by us and the names and addresses of all third parties that received personal information for their direct marketing purposes from us during the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2014 will receive information about 2013 sharing activities).

The nature of Online Forums such as blogging, chat forums and message boards is to share information and ideas with a public audience. Any information you submit for posting on an Online Forum may be posted on the KCETLink Sites or otherwise be made available to the general public.

<p><strong style="font-size: 1em;">5.&nbsp;<a name="priv5"></a>Ads and Information About You</strong></p>

<p>We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on the Site or across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities across the Internet and mobile media ("<strong>Behavioral Ads</strong>"). Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be interested. If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads on the Site, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below. Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information via a Device Identifier. These third party technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.</p>

<p>Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices, and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.</p>

<p>Some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is&nbsp;<a href="#privchart">available here</a>. Further, while sites use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("<strong>NAI</strong>") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance ("<strong>DAA</strong>") website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed</a>. Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out. We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out options or programs.</p>
