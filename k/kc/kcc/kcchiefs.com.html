<h2>Kansas City Chiefs Privacy Policy</h2>

<br>

 

<p>Effective Date: 07/07/2005<br>

whenever you visit the Website, such as your IP address. (See IP Addresses below)<br>

opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and
what emails you may be receiving from our subsidiaries and affiliates.&nbsp; Additionally, we keep a record of what
communications you have opted to receive or not to receive.<br>

<br>

 HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED<br>

 We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those
described below:<br>

<br>

 <em><strong>Registration</strong></em>: You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally
identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain
features the Website may choose to offer, such as newsletters.&nbsp; Participation in registration is voluntary and you
will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.<br>

<br>

 <em><strong>Newsletters and Website Emails</strong></em>: We offer free newsletters to share information with you
about the Website, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our marketing partners and advertisers and
sponsors.&nbsp; You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a
special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Website.&nbsp; Participation is voluntary and you
will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.&nbsp; You may also cancel
your free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Website or in the newsletter or email.</p>


<p><em><strong>Tell-A-Friend:</strong></em> If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about season
tickets, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.&nbsp; We may send your friend a one-time email
inviting him or her to visit the site.&nbsp; Kansas City Chiefs stores this information for the sole purpose of sending
an email and tracking the success of our referral program.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

 Your friend may contact us at <a href="http://www.kcchiefs.com/unsubscribe/">http://www.kcchiefs.com/unsubscribe/</a>
to request that we remove this information from our database.<br>

<br>

<br>

 <em><strong>Surveys or Voting</strong></em>: From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from
you in conjunction with a survey or voting poll. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide
whether or not to disclose information to the Website. Our fan polls are anonymous and do not collect any personal
information.<br>

<br>

 <em><strong>Cookies</strong></em>:&nbsp; As with many Websites, our Website uses a technology called “cookies.”&nbsp;
A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn’t actually
identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the
Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website.&nbsp; Cookies also let us know how many people visit our
website and where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable
information, like what web browser is being used to access the website. For registered users, cookies can make using
the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences.&nbsp; By tracking how and when
you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates
to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to
personalize your experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising which may
be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain
an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time.&nbsp; Some areas of the Website, however, may
not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.<br>

<br>

 <em><strong>IP Addresses</strong></em>: We may collect IP addresses. An IP address is a number associated with the
service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your
university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for
purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example
regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with
personally identifiable information.<br>

<br>

 <em><strong>Transaction Information</strong></em>: If you conduct a financial transaction with our Website, such as
such as “order information from our Website, buy our products, or subscribe to services offered on our Website, we will
ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information,
demographic information and financial information.&nbsp; We will use this information to complete the transaction that
you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice
you.&nbsp; For your protection, such information is collected and stored through encrypted means.<br>

<br>

 HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED<br>

 As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used to:</p>


<ul>
  <li>contact you about the Website;</li>

  <li>contact you relating to your membership status;</li>

  <li>confirm or fulfill an order you have made;</li>

  <li>inform you of a prize you have won;</li>

  <li>monitor or improve the use of the Website;</li>

  <li>customize the advertising and content you see;</li>

  <li>monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use of the Website; and</li>

  <li>send you promotional material or special offers on behalf of our marketing partners and/or their respective
  affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties.</li>
</ul>


<p>WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED<br>

 At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes.&nbsp; The following outlines the
ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your
information shared:<br>

<br>

 <em><strong>Agents</strong></em>: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on
our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists,
Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing
customer service. We may frame pages within certain sections of the site (examples include:&nbsp; the Pro Shop and
ticket purchases) that will have the look and feel of the KC Chiefs website; however, please be aware that you are
entering your information on 3rd party agent websites and not directly to the KC Chiefs.They may have access to
personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like
sending you marketing offers about their products.<br>

<br>

 <em><strong>Aggregate Information</strong></em>: We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Website
usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other
parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information. An example when the user accesses real video
content.<br>

<br>

 <em><strong>Other Promotional Offers</strong></em>:&nbsp; We may send offers to you on behalf of our marketing
partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such
offers, you may use the opt out method detailed in the email
<a href="http://www.kcchiefs.com/unsubscribe/">http://www.kcchiefs.com/unsubscribe/</a> or change your preferences by

<br>

 LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES<br>

 You should be aware that when you are on the Website you could be directed to other Websites beyond our control. For
example, if you “click” on a banner advertisement, the “click” may take you off the Website onto a different Website.
This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Website’s logo as part of a
co-branding agreement. These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit
personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is
linked to our Website, you should consult that Website’s privacy policy before providing any personal
information.<br>

<br>

 This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy
of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such
information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers
utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are
allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required.<br>

<br>

 A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS CONCERNING PRIVACY<br>

 The Website is a general audience Website. We do not currently collect any personal information from children under
the age of thirteen on the Website. If in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children, it
will do so in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) including,
without limitation, obtaining necessary parental consent. For more information about the privacy practices for our
affiliated children’s Website, NFLPlayFootball.com, please consult the privacy policy at the children’s
Website.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

 The Internet offers children wonderful educational and entertainment resources. Your guidance and involvement are
essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. We encourage you to visit the
Direct Marketing Association’s Web Website (www.the-dma.org) and explore the Get CyberSavvy! Program as well as the
GetNetWise Website (www.getnetwise.org) to learn more about parental control tools.<br>

<br>

 YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THE POLICY<br>

 By using this Website, you signify your agreement to the terms of our privacy policy.&nbsp; We may amend this privacy
policy at any time.&nbsp; If we make a material change to the way in which we collect, use, and/or share your personal
information, we will post a notice on our website and / or send an email to users who have provided an email
address.&nbsp; We will assume that you have given your permission for your information to be used under the terms of
the new privacy policy, if you do not respond to our email within thirty days or continue to use the Website thirty
days after a notice is posted.&nbsp; Please note that you should always update your personal information to provide us
with a current email address.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

 CORRECTING/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>

 YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS<br>

 A California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005, allows California residents to obtain specific
information about a business’s privacy practices if it shares information with other companies for those companies’
direct marketing purposes.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

 As explained in this privacy policy, whenever you agree to let us collect personal information about you, we will
always provide you with an option to prevent this information from being shared for non-administrative purposes with
third parties.&nbsp; You can exercise this option at any time by following the steps outlined
above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<br>

 Because this website has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may opt-in / opt-out
of the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes, we are not required to provide
you with this information.<br>

<br>

 If you are a California resident and have questions about our compliance with this law, please send an email to
<a href="mailto:CAPrivacyRights@kcchiefs.com">CAPrivacyRights@kcchiefs.com</a> or write to us at CA Privacy
Rights.<br>
