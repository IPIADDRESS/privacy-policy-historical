  <h2 align="center">School Loop Privacy Notice  </h2>
  <p align="center">(last
  updated February 2007)</p>
  <h3>Welcome</h3>
  <p>Welcome! School Loop, Inc. ("School Loop" or
    "us" or "we") welcomes you to our website at <a href="http://www.schoolloop.com/">www.schoolloop.com</a> (the "School Loop
    Site"). We provide an online
    integrated communication service that is designed to help teachers, students,
    school staff, and parents (collectively or individually "Users") share
    information about student homework assignments, grades, and other
    school-related information. We
  refer to our online application and our website together as the "Service."</p>
  <p>This Privacy
    Notice details important information regarding the use and disclosure of
    information submitted by Users to the Service, as well as information collected
    by the Service. This Privacy
    Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the School Loop Terms of Service.
    Your use of the School Loop Site and the Service and any information you
    provide on the School Loop Site or to the Service remains subject to the terms
  of this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Service.</p>
  <p><b>If we decide to change our
    privacy practices, we will post those changes on this page and in the "News"
    section of the Service. Please
    check this page for changes from time to time to make sure you are aware of our
  latest privacy practices.</b></p>
  <h3>Your Privacy</h3>
  <p>School Loop recognizes
    that School Loop Users value their privacy. School Loop understands that when a User chooses to submit
    information to the Service, that User trusts us to act in a responsible
    manner. We provide this Privacy
    Notice to help you better understand how we protect the information submitted
    to the Service and who has access to the information posted by you or about you
  on the Service. </p>
  <h3>Who Has Access to the Service?</h3>
  <p>The Service is a
    closed community network that is accessible only by registered members who have
    valid ID's. Only members can
    communicate with other members. One-to-one communication between adults and children is limited to
    school staff, and all communication is accessible by administrators. In addition, any adult who wishes to view
    a student's homework information must register with a valid ID number and have
    his or her membership reviewed by the affected student, who may challenge the
  registration.</p>
  <h3>Who Sets the Information Access
    Rules for the Service?</h3>
  <p>Each school or
    school district sets the rules for accessing the information on the Service by
  configuring the privacy settings for the Service. In general, the principles outlined below apply.</p>
  <h3>What Kind of Personal Information
    is Stored in the Service? Who has
  access to this information? </h3>
  <p><em>The following
  personal information is stored in the Service with respect to</em> <strong>Teachers:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>From the school district: first and last name, ID number,
      schedule (such as course titles, course id's, section id's, term, and roster)</li>
    <li>From the school administrator: email addresses</li>
    <li>From the
      individual teacher: edits to the first
      and last name submitted by the school district, login, password, and changes
      (if any) to the email address provided by the school administrator</li>
  </ul>
  <p>School Loop
    staff has full access to all of the above information in order to provide the
    Service, including providing technical support. Anyone with administrative rights to the Service has access
    to all of the above information except passwords, which are not viewable, but
    can be reset, by the administrator. Individual teachers have access to their own information. Students have access to the course name
  and the teacher name for their schedules.</p>
  <p><em>The following personal information is stored in the
  Service with respect to</em> <strong>Students: </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>From the school district: first, middle, and last name, id
      number, student id number(s), student schedules (course title, course id,
      section id, term, start dates)</li>
    <li>From the individual student: login, password, email address (if
      applicable)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>School Loop
    staff has full access to all of the above information in order to provide the
    Service, including providing technical support. Anyone with administrative rights to the Service has access
    to all of the above information except passwords, which are not viewable, but
    can be reset, by the administrator or by a member of the school staff. Teachers have access to student id's, student
    schedules (including the names of each class, the period, and the teacher),
  logins and email addresses, and can reset passwords (but not view them).</p>
  <p><em>The following
  personal information is stored in the Service with respect to</em> <strong>School Staff:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>From the school administrator: first and last names, email addresses </li>
    <li>From the individual staff member: edits to the first and last name
      submitted by the school administrator, login, password, changes (if any) to the
      email address provided by the school administrator, the staff member's role
      when joining a student's loop</li>
  </ul>
  <p>School Loop
    staff has full access to all of the above information in order to provide the
    Service, including providing technical support. Teachers and anyone with administrative rights to the
    Service has access to all of the above information except passwords, which are
  not viewable, but can be reset, by the administrator. Individual staff have access to their own information.</p>
  <p><em>The following
  personal information is stored in the Service with respect to</em> <strong>Parents:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li> From the individual parent: login, password, first and last name, telephone,
      email address</li>
  </ul>
  <p>School Loop
    staff has full access to all of the above information in order to provide the
    Service, including providing technical support. Anyone with administrative rights to the Service has access
    to all of the above information except passwords, which are not viewable, but
    can be reset, by the administrator. Teachers can access name, telephone, and email address. Individual parents have access to their
  own information.</p>
  <h3>What Kind of Content is Stored in
    the Service? Who Has Access to
  this Content?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>From the school administrator: LoopMail, news, discussions, and group
      messages</li>
    <li>From teachers: assignments, grades, LoopMail, news, discussions, and group
      messages</li>
    <li>From staff: LoopMail, news, discussions, and group messages</li>
    <li>From student: homework turned in, LoopMail, discussions, and group
      messages</li>
  </ul>
  <p>School Loop
    staff has full access to all of the above information in order to provide the
    Service, including providing technical support. Anyone with administrative rights to the Service also has
    access to all of the above information. The intended audience for news, discussions, and group messages has
    access to the applicable content. Teachers and staff can view content posted for courses (like homework,
    notes, and locker contents) on course sites. Teachers and staff can also view posted grades and student
    intervention files and discussions via a student's record, provided that there
    is a setting at the school level that can turn off the grades access. Students and parents can access posted
    content for their current or past courses if they are the targeted audience. Access to a student's grades by the
    student or the student's parents depends on the policy set by the school or
    school district. The Service
    allows a school's system administrator to program the access settings in the
  Service accordingly.</p>
  <h3>What Information does the Service
    or the School Loop Site Collect? How do we Use It?</h3>
  <p>When feasible,
    School Loop automatically collects your IP address. We also automatically
    collect and store statistics and other information about you and your online
    activities in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis. This information helps school
  administrators assess and manage the School Loop system.</p>
  <h3>When Will School Loop Disclose the Information
    it Collects to Outside Parties?</h3>
  <p>School Loop may store and disclose
    personal information as allowed or required by applicable law, including making
    disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (a) protect the rights, safety
    or property of users of the Service or the School Loop Site, the public, or School
    Loop or our web site suppliers; (b) conform to legal or regulatory
    requirements; (c) to deliver additional subcontracted services run by third
  parties.</p>
  <p>We do not otherwise disclose personal
  information collected by the Service to third parties. </p>
  <h3>How does School Loop Protect Personal
    Information?</h3>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect
    the data we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
    destruction. We do this by
    implementing industry-standard security procedures for storing and accessing
    information. However, you should
    be aware that we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and
    other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not
    otherwise described in this Privacy Notice. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be
    forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain
    circumstances; third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions
    or private communications; or users may abuse or misuse your information that
  they collect from our site. </p>
  <h3>What about "cookies"?</h3>
  <p>"Cookies" are small pieces of
    information that are transferred to your browser and stored on your computer's
    hard drive. Our cookies enable us
    to provide you with more personal service. Cookies also allow us to track usage patterns, trends and
    other aggregate visitor information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
    change your browser to prevent that if you would rather not store the
    information for future use. Please
    be aware, however, that if you choose not to store a cookie, you will need to
    login repeatedly, because cookies are what we use to manage your sessions. We may also collect certain technical
    and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the site
    and its services (such as browser type, operating system and the Internet
    Protocol ("IP") address of your computer). We do not match such information with any of your personal
  information without expressly informing you in each particular instance. </p>
  <h3>Third-party Sites</h3>
  <p>We may offer links to third party
    sites from our site. Please note
    that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any non-School
    Loop sites to which we may link. You should review the privacy policy of such sites before using the
  sites or providing any personal information.</p>
  <h3>Business Transitions</h3>
  <p>In the event School Loop goes
    through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another
    company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally
    identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via a notice on
  our Web site for 30 days from any such change in ownership or control.</p>
  <h3>Your
    Consent and Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p><b>By
    using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of this information by
    School Loop.</b> If we decide to change our privacy
    practices, we will post those changes on this page and in the "News" section of
    the Service. Please check this
    page for changes from time to time to make sure you are aware of our latest
  privacy practices.</p>
  <h3>Update your Information or Preferences</h3>
  <p>You can access and update your
    contact information and preferences by going to the Account Management page on
    your home page and following the instructions on that page. However, to the
    extent that such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot
    always ensure that such corrections or deletions will immediately reach the
  other databases.</p>
  <p>As School Loop is a product for
    schools and school districts, access to student login and password information
    is made available to school staff. This policy is in line with the rights and responsibilities afforded to
    schools under State and Federal statute. All material published on School Loop by students is considered
    public. For parents and other
  adults, access to specific passwords is denied.</p>
  <h3>Questions and Feedback </h3>
  <p>If you have any
    questions about this Privacy Notice or to provide us with feedback to help us
  improve our policies, please contact us by email at <b>info@schoolloop.com.</b> </p>
