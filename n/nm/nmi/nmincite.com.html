We also collect and store information regarding the content in your SocialGuide, Facebook and Twitter feeds and associate that information with your Account. We also collect and store (i) the time and date on which the content was first curated and (ii) information on the channels through which the content was shared, e.g., to other SocialGuide users, Twitter followers and Facebook friends.</p>
<p>In addition, unless you opt-out through your Account settings on SocialGuide or for certain features through the SocialGuide application, we share certain information about you, such as your username, any avatar or image you elect to post, your Twitter username, your feeds available through SocialGuide, Twitter, Facebook and other Third Party Services linked to your Account, and other information. This may include Personal Information, but only to the extent that you decide to share such information with others. This information posted or made available through SocialGuide is made public and shared by default, but remember, you have already agreed to make it public by sharing it via Twitter and/or Facebook.<br>We may retain content submitted by you to SocialGuide indefinitely, even after you terminate your Account.</p>
<p><em><strong>Information Collected From Third Party Services:</strong></em></p>
<p>SocialGuide shares your content from Third Party Services (such as Twitter and Facebook) through SocialGuide. We collect information related to your use of those Third Party Services, such as authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your Third Party Service accounts and content that you post to such Third Party Services. We may otherwise collect information about how you are using SocialGuide to interact with those connected Third Party Services. Note that Third Party Services may have the ability to restrict the information that is provided to us. We may also use the information from Third Party Services to build a default user profile for you based on information that we receive from Third Party Services, and make recommendations to you based on your profile, using our proprietary matching algorithms.</p>
<p><em><strong>Metrics and Analytics:</strong></em></p>
<p>We collect information about accesses of content curated through SocialGuide. This information includes, but is not limited to: (i) the IP address and physical location of the devices accessing the curated content; (ii) the time and date of each access; and (iii) information about sharing of curated content.</p>
<p><em><strong>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</strong></em></p>
<p>We automatically receive and record information from the SocialGuide application or your web browser when you interact with SocialGuide, including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with SocialGuide (e.g., what content you have clicked on). Generally, SocialGuide automatically collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of users accessing SocialGuide and various curated channels of content. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of SocialGuide so that we can analyze and improve them.</p>
