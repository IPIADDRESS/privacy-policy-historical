<p>This privacy notice covers the collection and use of information for this website, <a href="http://www.nmincite.com">www.nmincite.com</a> (“this website” or “we”). This website is owned by NM Incite (“NM Incite”).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cookies.</span></p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. When you leave a comment to a blog posting at this website, cookies store your name and email address so you will not have to re-type them again when you make subsequent comments. These cookies expire after one year.</p>
<p>You can set your browser to reject most cookies by following the browser help file directions. However, if your browser is set to reject cookies or you delete cookies, you may not be able to use some features of certain websites. You can also delete individual cookies or all cookies on your computer by following the browser help file directions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">When we may disclose your information to others.</span></p>
<p>We will keep your personally-identifiable information within the Nielsen family of companies. From time to time, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice, however, we may partner with unaffiliated companies or individuals for market research product development or similar purposes. These companies or individuals may be provided with access to personally identifiable information, but we will require by contract that they agree to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of such information. We also may subcontract with other companies and individuals to do work on our behalf; they may be provided with access to personally identifiable information, but only as needed to perform their functions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice, we may disclose personally identifiable information to any third party when disclosure is required by law, or desirable to permit us to exercise or preserve our legal rights or take action regarding potentially illegal activities or to protect the safety of any person. In the event that NM Incite is fully acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the unlikely event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of both Nielsen and McKinsey, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Children.</span></p>
<p>This site is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian believes that this site has collected the personally-identifiable information of a child under the age of 13, please contact <a href="mailto:contactcommunications@nielsen.com">contactcommunications@nielsen.com</a> and we will use our best efforts to remove the information from our records.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Access to your information.</span></p>
<p>You may contact us if at any time you would like to see the personally identifiable information we hold about you, or to ask us to correct or update this information, or to ask us to delete it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Data storage, transfers and security.</span></p>
<p>We may store the personal details we hold about you for as long as needed, which may be indefinitely. We may store this information in the United States or we may transfer it to any other country. The data protection laws in countries to which personal data are transferred may or may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your home country. Wherever we hold the data, we will apply the terms of this Notice and any applicable data protection law. We maintain certain procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of personally identifiable information while it is controlled by us. However, the storage and communication of personal data cannot always be completely secure. Also, we cannot and do not guarantee that data transferred to third parties in accordance with this Notice will be protected against intentional or accidental misuse or loss.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Please contact us if you have questions or wish to take any action with respect to information to which this Notice applies.</span> You can reach us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contactcommunications@nielsen.com">contactcommunications@nielsen.com</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">We may change this Notice and our data collection and management practices.</span></p>
<p>We reserve the right to update and make material and non-material changes to this Notice and to our practices in collecting and handling personally identifiable information. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email prior to their implementation and let you decide if you want the material changes to apply to the personally-identifiable information that we already hold about you. We will also post a prominent notice at this website and indicate at the top of this statement when it was most recently updated.</p>
