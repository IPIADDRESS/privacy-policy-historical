            <h1>Our Commitment to Privacy</h1>
            <p>The NRMP takes very seriously its responsibility to protect the 
              safety and security of its Web site and information collected through 
              the Web site. We recognize that users of the Web site and participants 
              in NRMP surveys may have questions about how and why this information 
              is collected. This Privacy Notice explains what kinds of information 
              we collect and how we use this information, and describes your and 
              our legal rights and responsibilities with respect to your personally 
              identifiable information, which we will call "personal information" 
              in the text below. This Privacy Notice is part of the terms and 
              conditions that govern your access and use of our Web site. If you 
              are unable or unwilling to agree to all the terms and conditions 
              below, please do not access or use our Web site or you will have 
              agreed to fully comply with all of our terms and conditions, including 
              this Privacy Notice, and consented to the collection and use of 
              your personal information as described below. We will refer to access, 
              use, transmission, and exchanges of information, availability or 
              utilization of features, functions or activities, simply as "use" 
              in the material below.</p>
            <p>The NRMP recognizes it has a responsibility to treat with care 
              the personal information it collects about individuals and institutions 
              involved in medical education arising from use of our Web site and 
              to respect their privacy relative to personal information that may 
              be sensitive. To meet those obligations, the NRMP has developed 
              policies designed to prevent the disclosure, compromise, and unauthorized 
              use of personal information without the permission of the individual 
              involved, to limit the distribution of personal information to those 
              situations that require it in order to perform our obligations related 
              to your use of our Web site, and to permit distribution of non-personal 
              information, such as directory information, wherever a useful purpose 
              can be served.</p>
            <h1>What Information We Collect and How We Use It</h1>
            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <p>As part of its Matching Program, the NRMP collects certain personal 
              information to provide you with the services requested and to engage 
              in research for specific, defined purposes. Such personal information 
              may include names, identification numbers, contact information, 
              institutional affiliation, and other biographical information. This 
              information is collected only through our password-protected Web 
              site, the <font color="#800000"><b>Registration, Ranking, and Results<sup>SM</sup> 
              (R3<sup>SM</sup>)</b></font><b> </b>system.</p>
            <p>In addition to using it for our Matching Program, your information 
              also may be used by the NRMP for educational research or verification 
              purposes or under restricted conditions by third parties as explained 
              below in <a href="#datasharing">Data Sharing with Third Parties</a>.</p>
            <p>NRMP surveys are designed to collect data for educational and research 
              purposes, including reporting to NRMP constituents and providing 
              summary information to the U.S. Congress and other policymakers. 
              From time to time, the NRMP may contact you to participate in such 
              a survey. Whenever the NRMP conducts research using personally identifiable 
              data (human subjects research), that research is reviewed by an 
              external (to the NRMP) institutional review board whose responsibility 
              it is to protect your interests.</p>
            <p>The NRMP reserves the right to use personal information in its 
              databases to confirm the identity of parties who may have made or 
              attempted to make unauthorized or inappropriate use of NRMP services 
              or assets or who may be a threat to public safety, including, but 
              not limited to, denial of service attacks, unauthorized use of NRMP 
              services, systems and/or networks, inappropriate email list activity, 
              unauthorized use or distribution of NRMP intellectual property, 
              or threats to the safety or privacy of the public. Contact information 
              will be used to provide notice to the offending individuals and 
              in such cases, personal information may be given to law enforcement 
              if warranted or required by law.</p>
            <h3>Credit Card Information</h3>
            <p>Once your credit card information has been passed to the credit 
              card processing company for verification, we retain only a limited 
              amount of the credit card information (e.g., several digits but 
              not all of your credit card number and your address when available). 
              Any credit card information we retain is kept within a secure, limited-access 
              database. It is not shared with anyone internal or external to the 
              NRMP, nor is it integrated with data from other NRMP databases.</p>
            <h3>Web Site Usage Information</h3>
            <p>Email addresses, aggregate information about which pages visitors 
              access, and information volunteered by Web site visitors—such 
              as user survey responses and Web site registrations—are used 
              to improve the content of the NRMP Web site. Some portions of our 
              Web site uses cookies or other information tracking technology ("cookies"), 
              to improve your experience and to help us administer, operate, and 
              manage our Web site more efficiently. You can set your browser to 
              notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you a chance to decide 
              whether or not to accept it, but if you choose not to accept them, 
              your use of the Web site may be limited and you may be required 
              to re-enter certain information each time you wish to use our Web 
              site.</p>

            <h1>Data Sharing with Third Parties</h1>
            <p>Information published by the NRMP that is related to its Matching 
              Program is accomplished using aggregate statistics. The NRMP may 
              share personal information with certifying boards, licensing bodies, 
              and other organizations involved in medical education for research, 
              eligibility determination, verification, and credentialing purposes. 
              Personal information also may be shared with medical education institutions 
              upon direction by you as part of the registration or application 
              process or for scholarship opportunities. The NRMP shares both non-personal 
              and personal information with these parties under certain limited 
              restrictions, including requirements to keep the personal information 
              confidential, destroy the personal information once it no longer 
              is needed for the intended purpose (except for applications to medical 
              education institutions), and to prevent unauthorized release of 
              personal information. The NRMP conducts such exchanges in a secure 
              manner designed to protect against access by unauthorized parties. 
              Rank order list information is never shared with third parties, 
              except under court order or in response to a subpoena issued by 
              a court of competent jurisdiction. Other than for the specific purposes 
              noted in this Privacy Notice or in any terms and conditions that 
              otherwise apply to you, we do not share personal information and 
              we never use or share any of your personal information for advertising 
              or marketing purposes.</p>
            <h1>Security of Collected Data</h1>
            <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and facilitate 
              the correct use of personal information obtained through our Web 
              site, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and 
              managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information 
              we collect online. Access to personal information is restricted 
              to NRMP staff members who require the access for specific purposes, 
              such as providing services to you or performing research.</p>
            <p>Messages you send to us through the Internet or otherwise electronically 
              may not be secure. We recommend that you do not send any confidential 
              information to us by email. <strong>If you choose to send confidential 
              information to us, you accept the risk that a third party may intercept 
              this information.</strong></p>
            <h1>How to Access or Correct Your Information</h1>
            <p>Access to your personal information is available through your NRMP 
              login (AAMC ID). When you register for an NRMP match, you have an 
              opportunity to correct or update most information you have provided 
              using our Web site. In the alternative and in some cases to correct 
              or update certain types of information (e.g., date of birth, name), 
              you may contact the NRMP directly at the address below to report 
              corrections.</p>
            <p>To protect your privacy and security, we also will take reasonable 
              steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections 
              following such a request.</p>
            <h1>Protecting Your Personal Information Online</h1>
            <p>Although the NRMP and the Association of American Medical Colleges 
              (which hosts the NRMP servers) take measures designed to protect 
              your personal information in their systems, you also must be vigilant 
              in protecting access to your information online and assume responsibility 
              for protecting personal information. Treat your user names and passwords 
              with care. Do not share them or enter them into fraudulent sites. 
              Be aware that legitimate NRMP and AAMC sites include "nrmp.org" 
              and "aamc.org", respectively. Do not conduct NRMP or AAMC business 
              with any sites that do not contain one of those addresses.</p>
