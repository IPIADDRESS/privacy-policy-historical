				</p><p><b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>Welcome to nRelate.com, a Website owned and controlled by nRelate, LLC., a subsidiary of IAC, Inc. (“nRelate”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). &nbsp;We operate a platform through which websites and other platforms can display other content owners’ work – including articles, product reviews, videos and blog posts.&nbsp; &nbsp;This helps website owners to provide relevant third party content to their users. &nbsp;When you see web content (usually thumbnails at the bottom or side of a page) that says “About These Links” and click on that link, you may see a pop-up box that identifies the content as being placed with our help.&nbsp; Our mission is to help websites, applications and other services use their free space show content that is both relevant and interesting, while also subsidizing their own (usually free) content.</p>
<p>We provide this privacy policy to let you know what information we collect from you, and how we use, share and protect it.&nbsp; We refer to the content that we help display as “Content Links.”</p>
<p><b>Scope</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the website located at&nbsp;<a href="http://nrelate.com/">www.nRelate.com</a>&nbsp;(the “nRelate Website”), the tools and interactive forums made available through the nRelate Website and the nRelate content-sharing platform (collectively the “Services”).</p>
<p>Generally, there are three categories of users of the nRelate Website and Services: “Publishers” who are operators or publishers of websites that make the nRelate sharing platform available on their own website, “Marketers,” who display their content across our platform, and “Users” who are individuals that visit a website. &nbsp;By visiting the nRelate Website or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs two sets of data practices:</p>
<p><a href="http://nrelate.com/privacy-policy/#section2">Privacy Practices for Users of the nRelate Services and Content Links</a></p>
<p><a href="http://nrelate.com/privacy-policy/#section5">Privacy Practices for Users of This Website</a></p>
<p><strong>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nRelate Services Content Choices and Opt-Out</span></strong></p>
<p>We believe that delivering targeted and relevant content enhances your internet experience.As we describe further in this Privacy Policy, we (or a partner we work with) may collect non-personally identifiable information from the websites that use the nRelate Services, including information about your browser, device, or IP address, and we (or our partner) may collect and use that information to avoid showing you the same content multiple times on Publishers’ websites, or to deliver content we think is relevant to you based on the content you have clicked on in the past on Publishers’ or other websites.If you prefer that we do not collect this information about your website visits for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you may&nbsp;<a href="http://nrelate.com/opt-out.php">opt-out.</a></p>
<p>If you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. &nbsp;The opt-out cookie tells us not to use your information for customizing content we serve.&nbsp; This may mean, for instance, that you may receive the same content multiple times rather than receiving new or targeted content.&nbsp; Please note that if you block cookies, our opt-out process may not function properly. Please also note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, clear your cookie cache, update your browser, or if you go online with a different computer or internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.</p>
<p><b>3.&nbsp;</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Privacy Practices for End Users Who Click and View nRelate Content Links:&nbsp; The Data We Collect and How We Use and Share It.</b></span></p>
<p>As part of the Service, we operate the nRelate platform, which helps website owners provide more relevant third party content to their users. If you are reading this policy, you are probably familiar with the way that nRelate helps content owners display their content on other websites.&nbsp; When you click on Content Links that is enabled on one of our Publisher websites, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information automatically for use on our platform. We may enable Publishers to use all of some of this information through the Platform for analytics purposes and we also may use this information for customizing Content Links to you, as described below.</p>
<p><b>(a)&nbsp;</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The Information We Collect When You View Content Links</b></span></p>

<p>i. The type of browser and operating system you have used to access the website;</p>

<p>iii. The website you visited before clicking and viewing Content Links, or that you viewed while clicking and viewing Content Links;</p>
<p>iv. Information about the Content Links you view and how you use the Services, including what you click and view, how long you view it.&nbsp; We may collect or store this information by using&nbsp;<a href="http://nrelate.com/privacy-policy/#section4">cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.</a>&nbsp;You can learn more about these online technologies in Section 4 below;</p>

<p><b>(a)&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies</span></b>.&nbsp; Cookies are small text files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers. For instance, cookies can be used to store sign-in credentials so that you don’t have to enter them each time you return to a website, or to store other information to make web viewing more customized or efficient upon future visits.&nbsp; Cookies also may store a unique identifier tied to your computer so that web services and content and advertising networks can recognize you across visits to different websites.&nbsp; You can configure your internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse all or certain cookies completely.</p>
<p><b>(b)</b>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>nRelate may use or support cookies as follows</b>:</span></p>
<p>i. To collect information about your browsing activities in order to deliver customized or relevant Content Links, services, or advertising or to you, through its Publishers or this Website;</p>
<p>ii. To relate the information collected by cookies to information we obtain from you directly or from commercially available sources;</p>
<p>iii. To work with third parties that help us serve Content Links (through our Services or across the internet) or provide other services to us, such as providing users the ability to view or comment on content or tracking site usage statistics.</p>
<p><b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Web beacons</span></b>. We may use technologies called Web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server.&nbsp; Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Web beacon was viewed.&nbsp; We may use web beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of the Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide content that is more relevant to you.<br>

<p>We take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. &nbsp;However, no security safeguard is 100 percent foolproof, and we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances.</p>

<p>Our Services contain links to, and allow Marketers to share content on, Publisher Websites and services. The fact that we link to a website or service or allow others to share content on them is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement or acknowledgement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
