					<a href="#2">How will you use my personal information collected online? </a><br>
					<a href="#3">Will NLOP, Inc. share my personal information with any third parties?</a><br>
					<a href="#4">What is NLOP, Inc.’ complaint policy/procedure?</a><br>
					<a href="#5">Can I opt out of your email list? </a><br>
					<a href="#6">What are cookies used for?</a><br>
					<a href="#7">Do you have an age requirement?</a><br>

					<a name="1"></a>
					<h3>What information is collected?</h3>
						<p>All users are required to register via the online form found at poker.NLOP. We ask that you  complete the registration form with accurate information so we can ensure  proper prize and award distributions.</p>
			
						<a name="2"></a>
					<h3>How will you use my personal information collected online? </h3>
					<p>purposes for which it is submitted, such as to register you for participation in a tournament, reply to your emails, handle your complaints, and process awards payment and business requests related to tournament participation.  We may also use such information to provide notifications related to tournament participation.  </p>
					<p>Unless you opt out, NLOP and its sponsors may, from time to time,  send you new offers and product promotions to bring selected retail opportunities to our players via direct mail, email and telemarketing; and we may include your personal information in a database of names of potential tournament participants provided to non-profit organizations running a tournament through NLOP, Inc. or its subsidiaries. By responding to such offers and promotions you may be accessing another website.  In that case, this Privacy Policy will no longer apply.  Instead, you will have to contact those advertisers separately and inform them if you do not wish to receive future mailings from them.  And remember, you may opt out of providing your personal information to third party businesses and non-profit organizations by checking the “opt out” box that will appear next your registration form when you register.</p>
			
					<a name="3"></a>
					<h3>Will Poker Creations or its partners share my personal information with any third parties? </h3>
					<p><strong>Internal Service Providers.</strong><br>
						We may use third parties that we refer to as  internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of  the business, product and service operations that we provide to you on this  site (such as search technology and prize distribution) and therefore we may  provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service  providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality  agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit any use of the  information we provide them for any purpose other than to facilitate the  specific outsourced site-related operation. </p>
					<p><strong>Legal Requests.</strong><br>
						We cooperate with law enforcement agencies and will respond  to all requests related to a law-enforcement activity by providing the  requested information without a subpoena. </p>
					<p><strong>Our Corporate Family.</strong><br>
						From  time to time we may share your data with our parent, affiliates, subsidiary  corporations and entities and joint ventures as well as any other business  entity connected with a planned merger with or acquisition by that business  entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined  entity follows this privacy policy with respect to your personal  information.(called “Corporate Family") that are committed to serving your  online&nbsp; needs and providing related  services. To the extent that these entities have access to your information,  they will agree to treat it at least as protectively as they treat information  they obtain from their other users. Our Corporate Family follows privacy  practices substantially similar to NLOP, Inc.' Privacy Policy. Should any such  a combination, merger or acquisition occur, we will require that the new  combined entity agrees to follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your  personal information.</p>
