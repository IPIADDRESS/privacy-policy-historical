	 <h3><a name="rec"></a>Recording your visit</h3> 
	 <p>When you look at this web site, we make a record of your visit and log
		the following information for statistical purposes:</p> 
	 <ul> 
		<li>Your server address.</li> 
		<li>Your top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk
		  etc).</li> 
		<li>The date and time of your visit to the site.</li> 
		<li>The pages you accessed and documents downloaded.</li> 
		<li>The previous site you visited.</li> 
		<li>The type of browser you used. </li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>No attempt will be made to identify individual users or their browsing
		activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law
		enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Library's logs. </p> 
	 <p>Some sites use "cookies" to track a particular user's access to a site.
		Cookies are not used on this site to gather personal information about users
		except when they are used within a specific web-based application for session
		management purposes.</p> 
	 <h3><a name="em"></a>Recording your e-mail address</h3> 
	 <p>We will only record your e-mail address if you send us a message. It
		will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and will not
		be added to a mailing list. We will not use your e-mail address for any other
		purpose, and will not disclose it, without your consent.</p> 
	 <h3><a name="pi"></a>Collecting personal information</h3> 
	 <p>From time to time we will use electronic forms on this site to gather
		personal information for purposes directly related to a function or activity of
		the Library. When we do so we will let you know the purpose for which the
		information is being collected (including if the information is to be
		published), and the legal authority for the collection if it is authorised or
		required by or under law. </p> 
	 <p>We will not collect or solicit personal information via this site which
		would be unlawful, unnecessary or unrelated to the functions or activities of
		the Library, or unfair or unreasonably intrusive.</p> 
	 <p>Because there are risks associated with using the Internet as a
		transmission medium, when we use electronic forms to collect information we
		will also provide you with other options for providing the information - for
		example, a paper form and mailing address and a telephone contact.</p> 
	 <h3><a name="pu"></a>Publishing personal information</h3> 
	 <p>We will only publish personal information on this site if it has been
		collected for this purpose with your knowledge or if you have consented to the
		disclosure. When giving such consent you should be aware that information
		published on this site is accessible to millions of users from all over the
		world, that it will be indexed by search engines and that it may be copied and
		used by any web user. This means that, once the information is published on
		this site, we will have no control over its subsequent use and disclosure.</p>
