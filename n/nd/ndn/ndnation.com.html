<p></p><h1>NDNation.com Privacy Policy</h1><p></p>
<p><b>Last Updated: January 1, 2015</b></p>

<p>The http://www.NDNation.com website (the "Site") is provided by NDNation.com, Inc. Collectively, this website and NDNation.com, Inc, shall be referred to as "NDN" throughout this and all other agreements pertaining to the use of the Site.</p>

<p>We value the relationship we have with our customers and Site visitors. We take the privacy of our Site visitors very seriously and want you to feel comfortable whenever you visit our Site. This Privacy Policy represents our general privacy approach to the information practices of our Site.</p>

<p><b>NDN Privacy Principles</b></p>

<p>Our approach to responsible information handling is based on the Fair Information Practice Principles, a cornerstone of which is providing notice of our information practices and other privacy aspects in order to allow individuals to make informed decisions regarding their personal information. When you visit our Site, information may be requested of you in order for you to participate more fully in our online offerings and services. When we collect personal information from you, we let you know what information is being collected, how it is collected, for what purpose(s) it is collected, and to whom it may be disclosed. We also identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we request additional or optional information, we inform you that provision of such information is voluntary so that you know it is not required to receive the requested product or service.</p>

<p><b>Personal Information</b></p>

<p>You may browse our Site without providing personal information to us. However, if you want to acquire a registered handle on our site to participate in online activities (e.g., message board postings, ticket exchanges), we may request that you provide us with information about yourself. When you provide personal information to us that may be used for secondary purposes, (i.e., uses not related to the purpose for which the information was collected), we give you the opportunity to opt out of such uses.</p>

<p>If you register for a handle on our Site, you will be asked for information such as your name, email address, and any other information that is necessary to complete your reservation. NDN stores IP address information associated with your registration and any electronic interactions you have with the site.

NDN will not use any email address for any third party advertisements or notices. NDN does not currently engage in marketing email efforts, but in the event such a policy is enabled, you will be given an opportunity to opt out of receiving further emails.</p>

<p>NDN may use your name and contact information to compile aggregated demographic information for market studies, data trending, or similar uses that will make the services offered by NDN more effective and useful. NDN may share the <i>aggregated</i> demographic information with its partners, affiliates, and advertisers. The aggregated information and studies will not be linked to any personal information that can uniquely identify you.</p>

<p>In addition, we may disclose your information (i) if required by law or legal process; (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials; (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary to enforce our Site policies or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety or (iv) to our service providers as necessary in order to provide the services set forth on our Site.  We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.</p>
