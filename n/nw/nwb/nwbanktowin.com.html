						<h2>Collecting, using, and sharing your personal information</h2>
						<p>We require you to share your personal information with us for some of our online activities. These activities include accessing your policies online, applying for products or services, and asking us questions.</p>
						<p>Personal information is any information that identifies you and describes your relationship with us. Some examples of the information that the Nationwide family of companies may collect include:</p>    </article>
    <article class="body-text   col-2">
            <div class="col">
                
						<ul>
							<li>Name, address, and Social Security number</li>
							<li>Assets and income</li>
							<li>Property address and value</li>

							<li>Public information</li>
						</ul>
					
            </div>
    </article>
    <article class="body-text   col-1">

						<p>If you apply for a product or service, we may collect information from your consumer reports, such as your credit report or motor vehicle report. We may use an "insurance score." An insurance score uses information from your credit report to help predict your future claims. Typical items that could affect an insurance score include payment history, number of revolving, new and collection accounts, bankruptcies, and foreclosures.</p>
						<p>You may request the credit report source. Each Nationwide company has different contact information and instructions for requesting this information, so you will want to review the specific privacy statement for the Nationwide product you own. We have included links to these products and companies in the box labeled “<a href="/privacy-security.jsp">Privacy Statement for Your Specific Product</a>.”</p>
						<p>In rare instances, we may also need to collect your medical information. However, we will not use or share your medical information for marketing, unless you give us your permission.</p>
						<p>We collect your personal information when you:</p>    </article>

						<p>We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services (e.g., quoting, re-quoting, account management.) We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
						<h2>Sharing customers’ personal information for servicing</h2>
						<p>We don't sell your information.</p>
						<p>When you buy a product, we may share your information with other Nationwide companies or our business partners to service your product, to conduct research and analytics, and to conduct surveys. We may also share your information with your agent, investment advisor, investment company, broker-dealer, or transfer agent affiliates. They use your information to manage your policy or account.</p>
						<p>We also share your information for everyday business and servicing purposes and as permitted by law. You cannot opt out of these. Some examples include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Mailing your statements or processing transactions that you request.</li>
							<li>Responding to a subpoena or governmental requests</li>
							<li>Investigating fraud</li>
							<li>Disclosing your information in connection with the sale or purchase of a business</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Sharing customers’ personal information for marketing</h2>
						<p>We want our customers to have choices about how and when they do business with us. So Nationwide sells insurance, investment, and banking products through many different sales channels, such as agents, the Internet, or over the phone. All of these different sales channels make it easy for you to buy our products and interact with us.</p>
						<p>Some examples of our sales channels include:</p>    </article>
    <article class="body-text   col-2">
            <div class="col">
                
						<ul>
							<li>Nationwide agents who sell Nationwide auto, home and life insurance</li>
							<li>Independent insurance agents who sell products from many different insurance carriers</li>
							<li>An independent broker-dealer who sells Nationwide annuities</li>
						</ul>
					
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                
						<ul>
							<li>Your bank, or another affinity group that you belong to, might offer Nationwide products</li>
							<li>Your employer may offer a Nationwide retirement plan</li>
						</ul>
					
            </div>
    </article>
    <article class="body-text   col-1">

          <p>Each sales channel has a specific privacy statement. These privacy statements explain how we use your information, including how we share it for marketing purposes.</p>
						<p>For example, we have signed contracts with some of our sales channels that don't allow us to share your information to market other products to you. If you purchase a Nationwide product through one of these sales channels, such as an independent agent, we will share your information only to service your product. Because we do not share your information for marketing purposes, there is no need for you to opt out. We will tell you if this policy should change and provide you with an opportunity to opt out before we share your information.</p>
						<p>We may share your information if our contract with the sales channel allows it. We may share it with other Nationwide companies or our business partners so they can tell you about products that might interest you. If this is the case, you will receive a “share” privacy statement with an opt-out choice. We may also have joint-marketing agreements with our business partners. This means that we may partner with them to offer you a product that might interest you. They may use your information to market their products. If you would like to learn more about opting out, please read the next section.</p>
						<p>To learn more, select your privacy statement from the list included in the box labeled “<a href="/privacy-security.jsp">Privacy Statement for Your Specific Product</a>.”</p>
						<h2>Opt out</h2>
						<p>You can ask us not to share your information with other Nationwide companies or our business partners to market new products to you. Please remember, we offer many different types of products and services. You may not want to opt out if you would like to learn about these products directly from one of our companies. Please call us toll free at 1-866-280-1809 to opt out of this sharing.</p>
						<p><strong>If you have already opted out, you don't need to opt out again.</strong></p>
						<p>If you don't want your registered representative to take your information to a new broker-dealer, please call us toll free at 1-877-223-3370.</p>
						<p><strong>Vermont customers:</strong> We won't share your information with Nationwide Companies or our business partners for marketing purposes without your consent.</p>
						<p>Remember, you don't have to opt out if you receive a "no share" statement because we won't share your information.</p>
						<h2>Confidentiality and security</h2>
						<p>We use reasonable physical and technical safeguards to protect your personal information, both during transmission and once we receive it. You may also choose to correspond with us via email. No method of transmission over the Internet, including via email, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure so, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
						<p>We limit access to your personal information to those who need it to do their jobs. The law requires our business partners to use your personal information only for our purposes. They may not share it or use it in any other way. We comply with all federal and state data security laws.</p>
						<h2>Access to Personal Information</h2>
						<p>If you are a customer, you can ask us for a copy of your personal information and correct or change it if necessary. Each of our companies has different contact information and instructions for requesting this information. You'll want to review the specific privacy statement for the product you own for these instructions. We have included links to these products and companies in the box labeled “<a href="/privacy-security.jsp">Privacy Statement for Your Specific Product</a>.”</p>
						<h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
						<p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our information practices. If we make material changes to our privacy policy, we’ll post the changes right here and notify you by posting a notice on this site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
