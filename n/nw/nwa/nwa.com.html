<p>4.2.&nbsp;<b>Information collected through our App</b></p>
<p>We use push notification tokens in the App to send notifications to your mobile device with updates for flight times, gate changes, and flight cancellations. The App will activate your camera if you choose to take a picture for a parking reminder, and will store the photo for you to look at later. If you choose, the App can access your device calendar to save itinerary information in your personal schedule. It can also bring up your default e-mail program, so you can send notes and reminders while traveling.</p>
<p>At times, we may promote the App via internet advertising on external websites. If you click on these advertisements and navigate directly to a third party application or other platform, information such as your phone’s device identification number may be sent to the advertising network, so that they and we may track the effectiveness of our advertising. This information might also be used for capping the number of times a specific visitor to a website is shown a particular advertisement, estimating the number of unique users, debugging, or security and fraud detection.</p>
<p>4.3.&nbsp;<b>Legal requirements and professional advice</b></p>
<p>We may also use your personal information where this is necessary to comply with a reasonable request by a law enforcement or regulatory authority, body, or agency, or in the defense of legal claims.<br>
<br>
We may also use your personal information when obtaining legal and other professional advice including for audits. We consider this to be in our legitimate interest in the management of our business.</p>
<p>4.4.&nbsp;<b>What if you do not provide information?</b></p>
<p>In some cases, we are legally required to collect certain information from you so we can provide the services you have requested, such as Secure Flight Passenger Data or Advance Passenger Information when you make a reservation to fly within, into, or out of the United States, or for point-to-point international travel. Failure to provide this information will mean we cannot provide the service.<br>
<br>
In some circumstances we need your information to perform our contract with you or to provide products and services, such as payment details and, on occasion, credit checking information. If you do not provide this information, we may not be able to enter into or perform the contract or provide the products and services.</p>
<p>4.5.&nbsp;<b>Authorization on behalf of another passenger</b></p>
<p>When you provide information to us about your travel companions (if, for example, you have arranged to make a booking on their behalf), you confirm to us that you have obtained their authorization to provide us their information and their consent to use their information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you cannot make these confirmations, you must not provide us with any personal information about these individuals.</p>
<p>4.6.&nbsp;<b>Sensitive Information</b></p>
<p>We may collect or receive sensitive personal information, such as that relating to health, disabilities, race, ethnicity, political opinions, biometrics, or religion, where permitted by applicable law. For example, we may collect and receive sensitive personal information from you when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide such information to us, a travel agent, or another third party involved in your travel arrangements at the time of or following your booking;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>disclose to us that you have a specific medical condition, will have an accompanying service animal, or request specific medical care or assistance, such as the provision of an accompanying nurse or wheelchair assistance, from us, an airport, or a third party involved in your travel arrangements; or</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>make a request that implies or suggests something about you which could be interpreted as sensitive personal information, such as a request for a specific type of meal that may suggest that you have a certain medical condition or hold a particular religious belief.</li>
</ul>
<p>By providing any personal information that is or could be sensitive personal information, you agree that you have given us your consent to collect, store, use, and transfer this personal information for the purposes for which it was provided and otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We occasionally receive personal information from law enforcement agencies and other sources relating to criminal activity (or alleged criminal activity) and may use that information where necessary, and where permitted by applicable law, to detect or prevent unlawful activity occurring during air travel. We consider this to be in the substantial public interest.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<b>DATA RETENTION</b></p>
<p>We store your information for as long as legally required or for so long as necessary to support business purposes described in&nbsp;<b>section 4</b>&nbsp;of this Privacy Policy and consistent with our record retention policies. In general, this storage will be (i) at least for the duration of our relationship, (ii) for as long as you can bring a claim against us and for us to be able to defend ourselves, and (iii) for any period required by tax, aviation, and other applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Our App will store user-provided data for as long as you use the related feature of the App, unless you choose to delete the App. Only information provided for travel clearance, purchases, and related activities will be stored in our operational systems as needed to provide your requested services.

We use the information we collect to enhance your visit to the Website and to provide you with information tailored to your needs.<br>

<br>
Delta has engaged third party tracking and advertising providers to act on Delta's behalf to track and analyze your usage of our Website through the use of cookies, pixel tags / web beacons, and similar technologies. At our request, these third parties collect, and share with us, usage information about visits to our Website, measure and research the effectiveness of our advertisements, track page usage and paths followed during visits through our Website, help us target our Internet banner advertisements on our Website and on other sites, and track use of our Internet banner advertisements and other links from our marketing partners' sites to our Website. To learn about the available mechanisms for opting out of cookies and technologies related to interest-based advertising, see the descriptions and links in the table below.<br>

Our Website and App are not configured to read or respond to “do not track” settings or signals in your browser headings or mobile device settings, which vary by provider. In lieu of a browser- or device-based opt-out solution, we have identified in the table below certain Digital Advertising Alliance and other approved methods for placement of “opt-out” cookies. Our Website and those of our third party advertisers or other vendors are configured to read and honor these opt-out cookies, so long as they are present on your computer or device.

<br>
</li>
<li>to persons with whom we are discussing selling any part of our business or to whom we sell any part of our business.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share with third parties anonymous, aggregated information about all our users.<br>
<br>
If your ticket is purchased pursuant to a corporate incentive agreement, we may disclose information concerning your travel to your employer or corporate travel manager.</p>
<p>When you use the App, a unique ID (which varies by device manufacturer and operating system) is read from or associated with your device to be used as an anonymous identifier for analytics and performance purposes. This ID might be generated by or shared with third parties providing us with analytics services, such as Adobe.</p>
<p>7.2.&nbsp;<b>Social Media</b></p>
<p>You may wish to share information regarding your travel or other activities with Delta on social media platforms provided by third parties. To utilize social media sharing features, you will be prompted to grant permissions within those third-party platforms, as you choose. For example, you will need to allow account login and publishing permissions.

</p>
<p>7.3.&nbsp;<b>Disclosure of personal information to passengers travelling under the same booking</b></p>
<p>When you make a booking, you will be provided with a booking reference such as a confirmation number or record locater number. Your booking reference should be kept confidential at all times. Disclosing your booking reference to other passengers may allow them to access your booking details through our systems. If you are travelling with others under the same booking and would not like your individual booking details to be disclosed to them, you may prefer to have each person make and pay for separate bookings.</p>
<p>7.4.&nbsp;<b>Delta Biometrics optional facial recognition technology at participating airports</b></p>
<p>Our customers at certain participating airports in the United States (currently, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Terminal F), including customers flying on Aeromexico, Air France-KLM or Virgin Atlantic, will have the option of using facial recognition technology when flying direct to an international destination to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check-in at the self-service kiosks in the lobby;<br>
</li>
<li>Drop checked baggage at the counters in the lobby;</li>
<li>Serve as identification at the TSA check point;</li>
<li>Board the aircraft at the departure gate; and</li>
<li>Go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processing when arriving into the U.S. on an international flight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any Delta Biometrics experience or biometric test with Delta is optional. If you choose to use facial recognition at a participating airport, your image, once captured, is encrypted and sent to CBP. To protect the security and privacy of your image, no additional information, such as name, document number, or date of birth, is sent with the image. CBP uses your image to verify your identity by comparing your image against images associated with your passport, other travel documents, or prior CBP border inspections, and Delta receives confirmation of your identity from CBP. Delta does not retain your biometric information. If you are a U.S. citizen, CBP deletes your image following verification in accordance with CBP policy. For certain non-U.S. citizens, CBP uses your image as biometric confirmation of departure from the United States.

<p>9.&nbsp;<b>YOUR RIGHTS</b></p>
<p>This section 9 applies only to individuals in the European Union and other countries which grant the rights described here. These rights will apply only in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>9.1.&nbsp;<b>Requesting a copy of your information</b></p>
<p>To the extent you are legally entitled, you can request confirmation of whether or not we process your personal information, and details of the information that we hold about you and how we use it.</p>
<p>You also have a right to access your personal information and to be provided with a copy.</p>
<p>9.2.&nbsp;<b>Right to rectification of personal data</b></p>
<p>If you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct it. You may also request us to complete personal data about you which is incomplete.</p>
<p>9.3.&nbsp;<b>Right to restrict processing of personal data</b></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal information where one of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>You claim that the personal data is not accurate. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to ensure the accuracy of the personal data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase the personal data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still need it in connection with a legal claim.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You have exercised your right to object to the processing. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing</li>
</ul>
<p>9.4.&nbsp;<b>Right to request deletion of personal data ("right to be forgotten")</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may request the erasure of your personal information in certain circumstances. For example, you may<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; request erasure if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>You have withdrawn your consent and we have no other legal basis for processing the personal information.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;You have exercised your right to object to processing the personal information, and we have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under certain circumstances, we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where we need to use the personal data to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, make or defend legal claims.<br>
<br>
If you exercise your right to erasure, this will potentially remove records which we hold for your benefit, such as your SkyMiles account information (including miles that may be in your SkyMiles account) and your presence on a marketing suppression list.</p>
<p>9.5.&nbsp;<b>Right to object to processing of personal data</b></p>
<p>You have a right, at any stage, to object to our using your personal information to send you marketing information.<br>
<br>
You also have the right to object to our using your personal information where our reason is based on our legitimate interests. We will have to stop processing until we can establish that we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or that we need to continue using it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p>9.6.&nbsp;<b>Right to data portability</b></p>
<p>This right applies where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our reason for using your personal information is either that you have given consent or that the processing is necessary for us to perform a contract with you; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We process the personal information by automated means.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a right to receive all the personal information which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this to another controller directly, where this is technically feasible.</p>
<p>9.7.&nbsp;<b>Complaints to regulator</b></p>
<p>You have a right to complain to a supervisory authority (i.e., a regulator which oversees data protection law compliance), in particular, in the European Union country where you live or work or where you consider we have infringed on your privacy rights.</p>
<p>9.8.&nbsp;<b>Exercising these rights</b></p>
<p>We may charge you a small administration fee to respond to your request as allowed by applicable law. In general, we do not charge any fee where the right is based on European Union law. (We can charge an administrative fee for extra copies of your information and in certain exceptional circumstances.)</p>

<p>10.&nbsp;<b>MINORS</b></p>
<p>Other than information required to complete a booking, Delta does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian may by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Privacy@delta.com">Privacy@delta.com</a>. We will remove the information and unsubscribe the child from any of our electronic marketing lists. Where required by applicable law, we may ask children for consent from their parents or guardians before we book their flight or provide a product or service to them.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;<b>LINKS</b></p>
<p>Our Website contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites, and Delta’s Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected from you by those sites.

<p><a name="pro"></a>We want to give you more opportunities to earn miles in the Delta SkyMiles Program. One of the ways we do this is by sharing your information with Promotional Partners. Typically, these promotional offerings are limited in quantity and geographic reach and targeted to specific demographic audiences. If you fall within the audience a Promotional Partner is trying to reach, and (where required under applicable law) you have consented to receive information about their services, you may receive a promotional e-mail or direct mail. Although we select our partners with care, these partners have their own privacy policies that apply to the way they use your personal data.</p>
<p>If you do not want us to share your information with one of these partners, you can always opt out by contacting us by using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.delta.com/contactus/commentComplaint"><b>Email Us</b></a>&nbsp;page&nbsp;or by calling the SkyMiles Service Center at +1-800-323- 2323.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;<b>DATA TRANSFERS</b></p>
<p>Delta is based in Atlanta, Georgia, USA and we may transfer personal information in compliance with applicable law to the US and other jurisdictions where Delta provides services.</p>
<p>For EU Residents: Some of the countries where Delta provides services may not have the equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your location. If we need to transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will take steps to make sure your personal data is protected and safeguarded once it leaves the EEA. In particular, we require third parties to whom we transfer your data to agree to abide by the Model Clauses approved by the European Commission and permitted under Article 46 of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). If you would like to obtain the details of such safeguards, you can request them from the Data Protection Officer at Privacy@delta.com. In some limited circumstances, we may also transfer your information outside the EEA if the GDPR (under Article 49) allows this. This includes where it is necessary for the performance of a contract between us and you and where the transfer is necessary in connection with legal proceedings.</p>
