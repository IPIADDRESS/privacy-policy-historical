<h2>We respect your privacy.</h2>
            <p>We know how   important it is to maintain the confidentiality of your financial information.   &nbsp;This page describes the privacy policy and practices followed by Northwest   Community Credit Union and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Northwest Financial   Resources. &nbsp;Read further for the types of member information we collect and   under what circumstances we may share it.&nbsp; <a href="agreement5.aspx">You may also want to refer to the   policy standards we have in place as part of our Membership and Account   Agreement.</a></p>
            <h3>Member Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We only   collect information about members we might need in order to establish and   maintain accounts and services as required or allowed by law. &nbsp;We may collect   personal and financial information (member information) which is “non public.”   &nbsp;The member information we collect varies depending on which accounts and   services you would want. Such information may come from the following   sources:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong><strong>Application   information</strong></strong>. We retain personal information we   receive on any application that is given to us for membership, deposit accounts,   EFT services, loans, financial planning, securities brokerage, insurance, or   other credit union services. &nbsp;This information includes: name, address, eMail,   social security number, birth date, phone number, employment, financial status,   and credit history.</p>
              <p><strong><strong>Transactions</strong></strong>.   When you make a transaction on your accounts (such as, ATM or debit   transactions, loan advances, On-Line Banking, or conducting business by phone or   at a branch), we retain the transaction information.&nbsp; This includes: account   number, the date, amount, location of the transaction, and other pertinent   information. &nbsp;Northwest Financial&nbsp;Resources (our&nbsp;investments and   insurance&nbsp;services subsidiary)&nbsp;may also provide us with reports on securities or   insurance transactions.</p>
              <p><strong><strong>Credit reports</strong></strong>.   When we evaluate an application for an account or service, we may request a   credit report about from a consumer reporting agency. &nbsp;We retain that personal   and credit history information and may use it to evaluate future requests for   services.</p>
              <p><strong><strong>On-line</strong></strong>. We may   obtain information on-line when you visit our Web site. &nbsp;This may include   information provided to us on any on-line application,&nbsp;On-Line Banking   transaction, or information sent to us by eMail.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3><strong>Member   Information We Share</strong></h3>
            <p>In order to   provide financial services, we may share certain information with our affiliate   and third party service providers. &nbsp;However, we only share information to the   extent necessary to service a member’s account or offer new services. &nbsp;If we   share information, it is with the goal of bringing quality services, more   choice, and greater convenience to our members. &nbsp;Information we may have about   former members is generally only shared or disclosed if necessary to enforce or   administer an account or as required by law.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong><strong>Sharing information with credit union   affiliates</strong></strong>. &nbsp;Northwest Financial Resources, a   wholly-owned subsidiary, provides financial services, including financial   planning, securities brokerage, and insurance products and services. &nbsp;We may   share personal information (such as name, address, account number) and account   information (such as type of accounts, account balances, transaction history)   with our subsidiary so they can serve you more efficiently.&nbsp; Northwest Financial   Resources&nbsp;maintains the same privacy standards as NWCU.</p>
              <p><strong><strong>Sharing information with third party   service providers</strong></strong>.

              <ul>
                <li>Personal information (name, address, and   account number) </li>
                <li> Account information (type of accounts,   account balances, and transaction history)</li><li>Transaction information (dates, amounts,   locations, and type of transaction)</li></ul>
              <p>We do not sell member information nor share your account   numbers with independent third party marketers who offer products and services.   &nbsp;While we may assist in offering financial products and services from our   affiliate or other financial service providers, we control the member   information used to make such offers.</p>
              <p><strong><strong>Sharing information as legally required or   permitted</strong></strong>. We may share your member information in   response to a lawful request issued by a court, government agency, or regulatory   authority or as permitted by law in order to administer or enforce your account.   &nbsp;We may also share our experience information about you with credit bureaus.   &nbsp;Our reporting to credit bureaus is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act,   which affords you the right to make sure that your credit bureau reports are   accurate.</p>
            </blockquote>
