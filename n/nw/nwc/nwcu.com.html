<h2>We respect your privacy.</h2>

<p>We know how important it is to maintain the confidentiality of your financial 
information. &nbsp;This page describes the privacy policy and practices followed 
by Northwest Community Credit Union and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Northwest 
Financial   Resources.&nbsp; Read further for the types of member information we collect 
and under what circumstances we may share it.&nbsp; You may also want to refer to the   
<a href="agreement5.aspx">policy standards</a> we have in place as part of our 
Membership and Account Agreement.</p>

<h3>Member Information We Collect</h3>

<p>We only collect information about members we might need in order to establish and
maintain accounts and services as required or allowed by law. &nbsp;We may collect
personal and financial information (member information) which is “non public.”   
&nbsp;The member information we collect varies depending on which accounts and services 
you would want. Such information may come from the following sources:</p>

<ul>

    <li><strong>Application   information</strong>. We retain personal information we receive 
    on any application that is given to us for membership, deposit accounts,   EFT services, 
    loans, financial planning, securities brokerage, insurance, or other credit union 
    services. &nbsp;This information includes: name, address, eMail, social security number, 
    birth date, phone number, employment, financial status, and credit history.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    
    <li><strong>Transactions</strong>. When you make a transaction on your accounts (such as, 
    ATM or debit transactions, loan advances, On-Line Banking, or conducting business by 
    phone or at a branch), we retain the transaction information.&nbsp; This includes: 
    account number, the date, amount, location of the transaction, and other pertinent   
    information. &nbsp;Northwest Financial&nbsp;Resources (our&nbsp;investments and   
    insurance&nbsp;services subsidiary)&nbsp;may also provide us with reports on securities 
    or insurance transactions.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><strong>Credit reports</strong>. When we evaluate an application for an account 
    or service, we may request a credit report about from a consumer reporting agency.&nbsp; 
    We retain that personal and credit history information and may use it to evaluate 
    future requests for services.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    
    <li><strong>On-line</strong>. We may obtain information on-line when you visit our 
    Web site. &nbsp;This may include information provided to us on any on-line 
    application,&nbsp;On-Line Banking transaction, or information sent to us by eMail.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Member Information We Share</h3>

<p>In order to provide financial services, we may share certain information with our 
affiliate and third party service providers. &nbsp;However, we only share information 
to the extent necessary to service a member’s account or offer new services.&nbsp; 
If we share information, it is with the goal of bringing quality services, more choice, 
and greater convenience to our members. &nbsp;Information we may have about   
former members is generally only shared or disclosed if necessary to enforce or   
administer an account or as required by law.</p>

<ul>

    <li><strong>Sharing information with credit union affiliates</strong>.<br>
    Northwest Financial Resources, a wholly-owned subsidiary, provides financial services, 
    including financial planning, securities brokerage, and insurance products and 
    services. &nbsp;We may share personal information (such as name, address, account 
    number) and account information (such as type of accounts, account balances, 
    transaction history) with our subsidiary so they can serve you more efficiently.&nbsp; 
    Northwest Financial Resources&nbsp;maintains the same privacy standards as NWCU.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    
    <li><strong>Sharing information with third party service providers</strong>.<br>
    In order to conduct our operations, including account service or processing 
    transactions, we need to share information with our service providers, 
    including: data processing companies, check, ATM and other payment processing 
    companies, payment networks, loan service providers, insurance companies, 
    collection agencies, credit reporting agencies, financial planners, securities 
    brokerage, and insurance companies, and financial service providers with whom 
    we have joint marketing agreements. &nbsp;These service providers act on our 
    behalf and have agreed in writing to keep the member information we provide to 
    them confidential. &nbsp;We share the following categories of information to 
    third party service providers depending on the specific services provided:<br>
    &nbsp;
    
        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal information</b> (name, address, and   account number)</li>
            <li><b>Account information</b> (type of accounts,   account balances, and transaction history)</li>   
            <li><b>Transaction information</b> (dates, amounts,   locations, and type of transaction)</li>
        </ul>
    
    </li>
    
</ul>


<p>We do not sell member information nor share your account numbers with independent 
third party marketers who offer products and services.&nbsp; While we may assist 
in offering financial products and services from our affiliate or other financial 
service providers, we control the member information used to make such offers.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing information as legally required or permitted</strong>.<br>
We may share your member information in response to a lawful request issued by a 
court, government agency, or regulatory authority or as permitted by law in order 
to administer or enforce your account.   &nbsp;We may also share our experience 
information about you with credit bureaus.   &nbsp;Our reporting to credit bureaus 
is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which affords you the right to make 
sure that your credit bureau reports are accurate.</p>

<h3>Our Confidentiality and Security Safeguards</h3>

<p>We have strict policies and security controls to assure that member information in 
our computer systems and files is protected. &nbsp;Our employees are permitted access 
to member information that they may need to perform their jobs and to provide   
service to you. &nbsp;Our employees have access to such member information as   
necessary to conduct a transaction or respond to your inquiries. &nbsp;All employees   
are trained to respect member privacy. &nbsp;No one except our employees has regular   
access to the credit union computer system and records storage. &nbsp;The Credit   
Union has established internal security controls, including physical, electronic, and 
procedural safeguards to protect the information you provide us   and the information 
we collect about you. &nbsp;We will continue to review our internal security controls 
to safeguard your member information as we employ new   technology in the future.</p>

<a name="Privacy"></a>

<h3>On-line Privacy Protections</h3>

<p>At our website you may apply for accounts and services and you may communicate with 
us via eMail. To protect the information you provide, we use multiple levels of security.&nbsp; 
The application information we   accept on-line and our On-Line Banking service rely on 
industry leading “Secure   Socket Layering” (SSL) encryption to secure your 
transaction information and   communications. &nbsp;Generally, eMails you might send are 
not secure. &nbsp;However, if   we ask you to eMail us information other than your name, 
address, eMail address   and phone number, it will be obtained using a secure SSL 
encryption eMail form.   &nbsp;When you visit our Web site, you can access site 
information, without revealing   your personal identity. &nbsp;However, in order to 
help us identify you for future   site visits, we may use “cookies” to 
record your visit. &nbsp;A cookie is a piece of   information that our web server stores 
on your computer hard drive and retrieves   later. &nbsp;The cookie will not request, 
require or collect personal identity   information, and you will remain anonymous.&nbsp; 
Your member information is not   accessed by or stored within a cookie in any way.</p>
