<p>Davantage Group Pty Ltd , trading as National Warranty Company, are committed to responsible privacy practices and complying with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“the Act”) as amended, including the Australian Privacy Principles (“APP”) in our dealings with customers and other individuals and entities. The Act and the APP are designed to protect individuals’ personal information by regulating the ways in which personal information may be collected, used, disclosed, managed and stored.</p>
<h2>COMPLYING WITH THE PRIVACY ACT HELPS US TO ENHANCE OUR CLIENT SERVICE.</h2>
<h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>
<p>Personal Information is information or opinion about an individual whose identity is apparent or can easily be ascertained from the information or opinion.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Personal Information</h2>
<p>Sensitive Personal Information is information or opinion about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political, trade or professional association or a trade union, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliations, sexual orientation, criminal record or health information.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Officer, is responsible for all matters to do with privacy.</p>
<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
<p>We collect Personal Information primarily from our clients, but also from other sources as may be necessary. However, we only collect Personal Information that we need and we only use the information that we collect for the primary purpose(s) for which we collect it. These are:<img src="https://www.nwc.com.au/images/miscellaneous/spacer5px.gif" alt="" width="5" height="5"></p>
<ul>
<li>Issuing Warranty Contracts;</li>
<li>Handling claims for Warranty Contracts;</li>
<li>Providing information about Warranty Contract matters;</li>
<li>Dealing with Representatives and Authorised Representatives;</li>
<li>Operating our business.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are entitled to know what information we collect and hold about you. For example, if we collect information from another source then we will make sure that you are aware and have consented to the collection of the information.</p>
<p>We have an obligation to ensure that information that we collect and store is up-to-date and correct.</p>
<h2>How do we use Personal Information?</h2>
<p>We do not use or disclose the information for any other purpose without the person’s consent.<br>
In particular, we do not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade, rent or sell Personal Information; or</li>
<li>Provide Personal Information to anyone without consent other than those we appoint to investigate and manage claims on our behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>We note that stricter regulations apply to any Sensitive Personal Information that we collect, use or hold.<br>
We do not collect or disclose sensitive information without consent unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>The collection is required by law; or</li>
<li>It is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a claim.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases we obtain consent in the usual course of dealing, e.g. in our Warranty Customer Contract &amp; Declaration. In providing products and services to you, we may also share your personal information with other members of our group or any other associated entities or related bodies corporate. We may also use your information to provide you with details of offers and products. Please contact us if you do not wish this to happen.</p>
<h2>What can we disclose?<img src="https://www.nwc.com.au/images/miscellaneous/spacer5px.gif" alt="" width="5" height="5"></h2>
<p>The Privacy Act does allow us to use or disclose information in some circumstances. For example, we can use your information in other ways if you consent to us doing so or if required to do so by law.</p>
<h3>Storage of Information</h3>
<p>All information that is collected in accordance with the APP will be stored on our secure systems and can only be accessed by authorised persons.</p>
<h3>Access to, and correction of, information</h3>
<p>You are entitled to contact us and access the information that we hold about you. You are also entitled to request corrections to the information we hold about you.</p>
<p>We can deny you access to the information we hold about you in certain circumstances.</p>
<h2>What if I am not satisfied with NWC’s response?</h2>
<p>If you believe that we have not dealt with your personal information in accordance with the law, or this policy, or you believe that you have been wrongly denied access to your personal information, you can refer your complaint to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner for further review.</p>
<p>You can contact the Office via their website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/" target="new">www.oaic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;or by writing to Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, GPO Box 5218, Sydney NSW 2001.</p>
