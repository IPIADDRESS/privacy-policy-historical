       <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
						<p class="p2">
                        </p><li><h2>General</h2></li>             
	<ol type="i">
		<li>NcDownloader website (the "Site") and the software available herein such as "plugin" software (the "Plugin"). This Privacy policy applies to your use of the Site, Plugin, or any of our services (the "Services") and is part of our Service Agreement available at NcDownloader</li>
		<li>In this Privacy Policy we explain the type of information we collect through our Site, Plugin and Services, and what We do with such information.</li>
		<li>If you choose to download the Plugin or use our Site or any of our Services, you will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
		<li>If you do not agree to any of the terms herein do not use our Site our Plugin or any of our Services.</li>
		<li>One feature of the plugin that may be enabled for you is displaying relevant coupons, deals, and special offers.  When you visit a website of a merchant or affiliate store that participates in the coupon program, the plugin is designed to recognize the website to determine whether there are coupons, deals, or special offers available. If there are applicable coupons, deals, or special offers available, it will make all reasonable business efforts to display an alert with the coupons, unless the website has opted out. You may then click on the alert displayed to see all specific coupons, deals, and special offers found as you browse the website. The plugin is an optional application and you can always choose whether to use it or not as part of your browsing experience. You can remove or disable the application at any time. When the plugin recognizes that the end user has visited a partner site it will show all available offers for that partner in a slider visible in the top right hand portion of the browser. Clicking on any of the offers within the slider will result in a redirect that will drop affiliate cookies on to the end user computer and resolve the end user to the advertiser page/offer.</li>	</ol>
