We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our sites and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Advertising Practices</strong></p>
<p>
	This section describes certain of our advertising practices, such as the collection and use of information to deliver advertising. We, our service providers, advertisers or partners may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information when you interact with us or visit any of our sites. A representative list of the types of non-personally identifiable information that may be collected include: current Internet protocol address and type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink), the web pages you have visited, the content you have accessed and the advertisements you have been shown and/or clicked on. The non-personally identifiable information collected may be combined with information from other sources and/or shared with third parties.<br>
	The non-personally identifiable information collected may be used to improve the design and content of our sites, and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. This information may also be used to provide you with additional product and service opportunities and to make inferences about your interests in order to deliver more relevant marketing messages and advertisements. We also may use this information to analyze usage of our sites.</p>
<p>
	The practices described in this section are enabled by the technologies and relationships described in the "Cookies &amp; Web Beacons" and "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors" sections below.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cookies &amp; Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>
	To enhance your online experience, we use "cookies" or similar technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once you choose to furnish a site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.<br>
	We use cookies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our sites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising.</p>
<p>
	We, our third party service providers, advertisers or our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or sites. This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising. For more information regarding third-party ad servers, see "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors" below.</p>
<p>
	We, our third party service providers, advertiser or our partners may also use "web beacons" or clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.</p>
<p>
	You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at Turner Network sites. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors</strong></p>
<p>
	Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
<p>
	Turner Network sites covered by this privacy statement sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.</p>
<p>
	We also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting and ad response measurement, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement. For more information on how our sites may use third-party ad servers and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third party ad servers, please see the section below on "Third Party Ad Servers".</p>
<p>
	<strong>Third Party Ad Servers</strong></p>
<p>
	We, our partners and/or our advertisers may use third parties to serve or present the ads that appear on our sites and to conduct research about the advertisements. Below is a representative list of such third parties and a link to their privacy policies. For more information, visit the sites listed below:</p>
<p>
	Atlas<br>
	Bluestreak<br>
	DoubleClick<br>
	Eyeblaster<br>

<p>
	<strong>Flash Cookies</strong></p>
<p>
	The Adobe Flash Player is a powerful application and web tool that allows rapid development of highly dynamic content. Flash (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. Sites on the Turner Network employ Adobe Flash Cookies in certain situations where we use Flash to provide special content such as video on demand, video clips or animation. You can access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s web site directly.</p>
<p>
	<strong>International Transfer</strong></p>
<p>
	Turner operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. In particular, your information will likely be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. The data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using this site you consent to your information being collected, used and transferred as set forth in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Our Commitment to Security</strong></p>
<p>
	We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online.</p>
