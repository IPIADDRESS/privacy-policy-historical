</p><center><b><font size="4" face="Arial">NCR's Position on Privacy
and Data Protection<br>
</font></b></center>
<p>
<font face="Arial">As a leading producer of customer transaction
solutions, NCR has long been concerned about protecting personal
information it gathers about its employees and customers. NCR
(as a member of the national trade association for the information
technology industry - now ITI) adopted its first set of privacy
principles in 1971.<br>
</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial">NCR also considers data protection a customer
satisfaction issue. We seek to meet all customer expectations
in our solutions, products and services-and in our business practices.
We will meet the customer demand for privacy protection.<br>
</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial">NCR believes that individuals have the right
to be informed about the information being collected about them
and about its intended use. People should also have the right
to "opt out" if they do not wish to have personal data
used for other purposes. They should also have the right to review
information being retained and the means to update and correct
it.<br>
</font>
</p><p>
<b><font face="Arial">Our Web Site</font></b>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial">When you visit us at www.ncr.com we want you
to feel secure that NCR is respecting your privacy. In fact, the
only private information we have about you is the information
you choose to give us by filling out a form or providing feedback.
We do not give that information to third parties without notifying
you on the form and getting your consent.<br>
</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial">We may use "cookies" on some pages
of our site, simply to help us serve you better each time you
return. A cookie is a small element of data that a Web site can
send to your browser, which may then store it on your system.
<br>
</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial">The data collected from cookies helps us determine
how many people visit this site and what pages they view. We use
this information to better serve all visitors as we improve our
site content and design. You can set your Web browser to warn
you before you accept a cookie.<br>
</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial">We do collect information on the domains from
which people visit us. Again, we use that data to track trends
in our site traffic and as the basis for making improvements.
We do not share this information with any third parties.<br>
</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial">NCR is committed to protecting personal data
on this site just like we are committed to helping our customers
protect <i>their </i>customers' privacy. NCR realizes it is in
a unique position to deliver the capability for protecting personal
data to its customers and is moving aggressively to provide this
protection in its data warehousing, data mining, retail, financial
and Internet solutions.<br>
