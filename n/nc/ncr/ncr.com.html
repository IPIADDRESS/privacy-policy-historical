<div><h3><strong>NCR Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<h3><strong> (Last Updated:&nbsp; February 7, 2014)</strong></h3>
<p>NCR Corporation, its affiliates  and its subsidiaries (collectively “NCR”) is committed to protecting the  confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information (as defined below) about  you that we collect, use, or disclose or otherwise Process (as defined below),  including Personal Information to which NCR has access in connection with the  provision of products and services to our customers (in this Privacy Policy,  “you” includes any individual about whom NCR collects, uses, or discloses Personal  Information). &nbsp;NCR takes reasonable and appropriate  steps to safeguard this information in accordance with the applicable laws of  the countries in which we conduct business and our contractual requirements.</p>
<h4><span>Scope  of this Privacy Policy</span></h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to  any Personal Information that NCR collects, uses, or discloses regardless of  how or where that information was obtained, or where it is stored or used,  unless otherwise noted either in this Privacy Policy, in a supplement, or in a separate  policy that we make available to you.</p>
<h4><span>Definitions</span></h4>
<p><strong>“Contract Data</strong>” means Personal Information about our customers’  customers or our customers’ personnel that NCR Processes in connection with  providing products and services to a customer under a customer contract. &nbsp;Contract Data is a subset of “Personal  Information.”</p>
<p><strong>“Personal Information”</strong> means information  relating to an identified or identifiable natural person to the extent such  information is afforded the protection of law. An identifiable natural person  is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by  reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to the  individual’s physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social  identity.</p>
<p><strong>“Process” </strong>means any operation or set of operations which is  performed upon Personal Information, whether or not by automatic means, such as  collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration,  retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or  otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure, or  destruction.</p>
<h4><span>NCR Customer Obligations  with Respect to Contract Data</span></h4>
<p>In  furtherance of the provision of products and services under certain of our  customer contracts, NCR  may Process Contract Data covered by this Privacy Policy for, and at the  direction of, our customers. In such situations, NCR acts solely as a processor  and relies on its customers to comply with applicable legal requirements.&nbsp; Except as otherwise noted, the NCR customer’s  privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy, applies to such Processing.</p>
<h4><span>Collection  of Personal Information</span></h4>
<p>The Personal Information NCR may collect  about you includes, but is not limited to, user IDs and passwords; demographic  information; contact details, such as your name, address, email address, or telephone  number; geo-location data; or education or employment data.</p>
<p>You may provide Personal  Information to NCR in a variety of ways, such as by registering for an on-line  account or event, joining a mailing list, purchasing a product or service, applying  for employment, filling out an information form, or otherwise contacting us  with a question, comment, or request.&nbsp;  Additionally, NCR may collect information about you or obtain Personal  Information from third parties. NCR may also use certain technologies to  collect information about you while you are visiting an NCR website, as  described <strong><a href="#cookies">below</a></strong>.&nbsp; NCR will obtain Personal Information about  you only by fair and lawful means.</p>
<p>With respect to Contract Data, it  is our customers’ responsibility to ensure that NCR‘s collection and processing  of their customers’ Personal Information is consistent with the terms of such  customers’ own privacy policies.</p>
<h4><span>Use  of Personal Information</span></h4>
<p>NCR will use Personal Information covered by this  Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with applicable law and that is reasonably  necessary to fulfill its business needs, including facilitating NCR’s  compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. NCR may combine Personal  Information it obtains about you from various other sources to help us improve  its overall accuracy and completeness, and to help us better tailor our  interactions with you. NCR will retain Personal Information only for so  long as it is helpful to support the overall purpose(s) for which NCR collected  the information. NCR’s use may include, but is not limited to, making sales  calls, sending marketing communications, delivering or completing requested  services or transactions, and analyzing a series of transactions.</p>
<p>NCR will use Contract Data consistent with applicable  contractual obligations and applicable law.&nbsp;  &nbsp;NCR also may use Contract Data to  facilitate compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sales and Marketing. </em>NCR may use your </strong>Personal Information for sales and marketing purposes, including contacting  you for feedback in customer satisfaction surveys or for market research  purposes, providing you with marketing literature on products and services,  notifying you of events, and providing you with information about NCR. You may  always change your privacy preferences as set forth below. From time to time, NCR may co-brand  an offering or a communication with a third party, which may also collect your Personal  Information or with whom we may share it. &nbsp;In such cases, the use of your Personal  Information by such third parties is covered by their respective privacy policies,  and not this Privacy Policy. If those cases where you choose to forward a page to  another individual (where such option is available), NCR may request certain  Personal Information about that individual to complete your request, such as their  name and e-mail address, but NCR will not make further use of such information.</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Networking Tools. </em></strong>If NCR uses social networking tools to provide information to you, your  information will be governed by the terms of use and the privacy policy for the  applicable social networking tool.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fulfilling Business Transactions</em></strong>. NCR may use your Personal  Information to fulfill business transaction requests with you or your  organization.&nbsp; With respect to our  customers, such requests may include, but are not limited to, providing products  or services, such as delivering notifications of product fixes and updates, or contacting  you in response to your questions, comments, or requests. With respect to our  suppliers, such requests may include issuing purchase orders, receiving  invoices, or providing other information such as forecasts.&nbsp; If, in providing support (including support  to assist you with the use of our website), we engage you telephonically  through tools such as online chat, we may monitor or record our interaction for  purposes of quality assurance, training, or to document the details of a  transaction.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recruitment. </em></strong>If you seek employment with NCR, you may provide us with information  about yourself, such as a resume. We may use this information throughout NCR in  order to consider you for employment purposes, and may keep your information on  file for future consideration and to support NCR’s compliance with applicable legal  requirements.</p>
<h4><span>Disclosure  of Personal Information</span></h4>
<p>We may share Personal Information  (including Contract Data) within NCR and transfer it to countries around the  world in which we operate in connection with the uses described in this Privacy  Policy and in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p>We may share Personal Information  with third-party suppliers and service providers that help us Process Personal  Information. It is NCR’s practice to enter into contracts with our suppliers and  service providers that require them to handle your information in a manner  consistent with NCR policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>NCR also may provide information that identifies you at an individual  level to third-party business partners, such as resellers.&nbsp; NCR does not, however, sell or rent such  information to these third parties.</p>
<p>From time to time, NCR may contemplate entering into various business  development activities which may include the sale, purchase, merger, or  reorganization of one or more of its businesses.&nbsp; These business development activities may  require the disclosure of Personal Information to the prospective or actual  purchaser(s). When such disclosures are required, NCR will seek appropriate  protections of your Personal Information.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, NCR may use or release Personal Information to third parties when disclosure is required by law (e.g. statute,  judicial proceeding, court order, or subpoena). We also reserve our right to  use or provide your Personal Information to third parties, including law  enforcement, auditors, consultants, and government officials, to protect NCR’s  rights or property, and/or the rights or property of our customers, business  partners, suppliers, or other third parties.</p>
<h4><span>Setting Your Privacy Preferences and Opting  Out</span></h4>
<p>We will provide mechanisms for  opting out of mass marketing communications directed to you. In addition, you  may indicate to us that you no longer wish to receive emailed marketing  communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in  the email communications we may provide to you, and you may always <strong><a href="#contact-us">contact us</a></strong> directly as set forth in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Accessing  and Maintaining the Accuracy of Your Personal Information</span></h4>
<p>NCR strives to maintain the accuracy of any Personal  Information we collect, and we provide several mechanisms to allow you to  review and request correction or deletion of Personal Information related to  you where it is inaccurate (except where the burden or expense of providing  access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the  rights of other persons would be violated).&nbsp; We may, however, take  reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your  Personal Information.&nbsp; With respect to Contract Data, the NCR customer is  responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the Personal Information it  collects about you.</p>
<p>You may use the contact mechanisms specified <strong><a href="#contact-us">below</a></strong> to request that we update, correct, or delete  your Personal Information on file with us (subject to the limitations set forth  in the preceding paragraph). Requests to access, correct, or delete Personal  Information controlled by third parties (such as Contract Data) must be made  through that third party.</p>
<h4><span><a id="cookies" name="cookies"></a>Use of Cookies and Other Technologies</span></h4>
<p>As described in more detail below, NCR websites may  employ a variety of tools to help us improve your experience on our website and  determine the effectiveness of certain of our marketing initiatives.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cookies.</em></strong>&nbsp; A cookie is  a small element of data that a website can send to a Web browser, which is then  stored on the browser user’s computing device. We may use cookies, alone or in  combination with other data we may collect from other technologies (such as  server logs) to make our website work or operate more efficiently, to  personalize a user’s experience, or to make our websites more useful to our  visitors. When NCR places a cookie on your device from an NCR domain, such as <strong><a href="http://www.ncr.com/">www.NCR.com</a></strong>,  this is a called a “first party cookie.” &nbsp;If a third party, such as an advertiser,  places a cookie on your device, those cookies are called “third party  cookies.”&nbsp; NCR’s Privacy Policy only  applies to first party cookies. You can learn more about cookies by visiting <strong><a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/cookies.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/cookies.shtm</a></strong> or <strong><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Internet browsers typically have a default setting  to “automatically accept cookies.”&nbsp; Most browsers,  however, permit users to change their settings either to refuse all cookies or  to selectively accept them.&nbsp;If you would like to change your browser’s  cookies settings, please refer to the online help offered with your browser or  to the manufacturer’s website.&nbsp; Please  note, however, if you decide to turn off cookies, there may be some features of  our websites that may not be available to you and some pages may not display  properly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Technology NCR May Use to Improve  Your Experience.</em></strong>&nbsp; NCR may  also use other technology to improve your experience.</p>
<p><span>Analysis tools</span><em>. </em>NCR may use Google Analytics to help us analyze the  data we obtain from cookies and other technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish to turn off Google Analytics,  Google has provided a browser add-on for many commonly-used browsers.&nbsp; Please visit Google’s website to obtain this  add-on: <strong><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span>Log File Information</span><em>.&nbsp; </em>NCR records log file information whenever you access  our websites.&nbsp; Examples of log file  information include your IP address, your browser type, the page from which you  accessed our website, the pages you viewed while visiting our website, the last  page you viewed before you exited our website, and the page you accessed after  leaving our website. We use this data in the aggregate and do not use it to  identify you individually.</p>
<p><span>Web Beacons</span><em>.</em>&nbsp; This  Privacy Policy covers web beacons placed by NCR.&nbsp; A web beacon is an electronic (and usually  transparent) image that is placed on a website or in an email.&nbsp; Web beacons recognize certain information on  your device such as cookies, the time and date of a page you viewed and the  length of time you viewed the page, the <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html"><strong>IP address</strong></a> of  the device that retrieved the image, the time the web beacon was viewed and for  how long, and the type of <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/browser.html"><strong>browser</strong></a> that retrieved the image.&nbsp; We may use  web beacons, for example, to determine whether you have opened, or accessed  links included in, a marketing communication from NCR. Web beacons often work  with cookies; therefore, if you do not want us to associate your cookie  information with your visits to our website, you must turn off cookies in your  browser.</p>
<p><span>Web Links</span><em>.</em>&nbsp; Emails from  NCR may contain links that are designed to take you to a web page after  redirection through NCR’s servers (or those of its suppliers). We use the  information we obtain during the redirection process to determine whether a  particular marketing initiative is effective, and may collect information  connected to your identity. If you do not want NCR to collect information about  the links that you click, you can choose a text-based version of the message (if  the option is available).&nbsp; You may also  choose not to click the links we provide in the emails we send to you.</p>
<p><span>Local Shared Objects  (“Flash Cookies”)</span>.&nbsp; NCR may  use Adobe Flash Player® to deliver multimedia content, such as a video, to you.&nbsp; To improve your user experience, NCR may use  Flash local shared objects (LSOs) – sometimes called “flash cookies” – to store  your flash content information and preferences, similar to other types of  cookies NCR employs.&nbsp; You can manage flash  cookies by accessing the following link on Adobe’s website:<br> <strong><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a></strong><br> In addition, users of the Mozilla  Firefox browser can install an  extension that detects and deletes flash cookies.&nbsp; You may obtain this add-on by accessing the following link: <br> <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Online  Advertising</span><em>.</em> Third parties do not  advertise on NCR’s websites.&nbsp; NCR, however,  may contract with third parties who collect information  about your online activities over time and across different websites (including  NCR websites).&nbsp; We engage with these  third parties to help us deliver targeted advertisements about NCR on other websites  you visit. These third parties use  cookies or web beacons across multiple websites, including NCR’s websites, to  collect certain information about you to provide you with targeted ads based on  your interests. Your name, address, and other contact information are not  collected.<strong> </strong>You have several choices to control the delivery of  targeted ads to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may turn off cookies in your browser. For more information about this  choice, please refer to the “<strong><a href="#cookies">Use  of Cookies and Other Technologies</a></strong>” section of this  Privacy Policy.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Some browsers permit users to adjust browser settings or may contain add-ons  to help you manage your ad choices.&nbsp; Please  refer to the online help offered with your browser or to  the manufacturer’s website. </li>
<li>You may opt out of the third party’s advertising  network.&nbsp; We have provided the following  information to help you with this choice: 
<ul>
<li>The Network Alliance Initiative and the Digital  Advertising Alliance websites offer opt-out tools to assist you in managing  your choices for participating companies. For more information about these  tools please visit <strong><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">NAI Opt-Out Page</a>&nbsp;</strong>and <strong><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">DAA  Opt-Out Page.</a></strong></li>
<li>You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by  visiting Google's <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">AdsSettings</a></strong>. </li>
<li>You may opt out of DoubleClick's use of cookies by  visiting the <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb#display_optout">DoubleClick Opt-Out Page</a></strong> or the <strong><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">NAI Opt-Out Page</a></strong>.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that, even if  you exercise your choices, you may still receive generic, non-targeted ads from  NCR.</p>
<p>NCR websites do not respond  to Web browser “do not track” browser header (or equivalent). If we do so in  the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Visit the following website,  www.allaboutdnt.org, for more information on this developing area.&nbsp; If, however, your Web browser is set so as not  to accept cookies, your use of our websites will not be tracked.</p>
<h4><span>Protection  of Your Personal Information</span></h4>
<p>NCR takes data security seriously.<strong> </strong>We have implemented reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and  organizational measures that are designed to protect Personal Information  covered by this Privacy Policy, including Contract Data, from loss, misuse, and  unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
