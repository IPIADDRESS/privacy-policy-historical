<h1>NCU Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>Northcentral University is committed to protecting your privacy and
developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online
experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to the NCU family of Web
sites and governs data collection and usage at all NCU sites and services.
Please read the complete Statement of Privacy below to learn additional details
about how some of these sites and services protect your personal information.</p>

<h3>Collection of your Personal Information</h3>

<p>At some sites, NCU collects personally identifiable information, such as
your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. At other
sites, anonymous demographic information is collected, which is not unique to
you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, and preferences. Some sites collect a
combination of the two types of information. Information collected at one
University Web site may be shared within the NCU family of Web sites.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable
information or personally sensitive data through NCU Chats, Communities, or
other public online forums, this information may be collected and used by
others. Your NCU Chat conversations, messages, e-mails, and Web Site Accesses
are completely confidential.</p>

<p>Northcentral University encourages you to review the privacy statements of
other Web sites that you visit so that you can understand how those sites
collect, use and share your information. If you choose to follow links from NCU
Web pages to other “external” Web domains, please note that NCU is not responsible 
for the privacy statements or other content on sites other than those within the
NCU family of web sites.</p>

<p>There may also be information about your computer hardware and software that
is automatically collected by Northcentral University and may be shared with
other Web sites within the NCU family of web sites. This information can
include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and
referring Web site addresses. This information is used for the operation of the
service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics
regarding use of the University Web sites.</p>

<h3>Use of your Personal Information</h3>

<p>NCU Web sites and their operational service partners collect and use your
personal information to operate University Web sites and deliver the services
you have requested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>University sites
also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other
products or services available from NCU and its affiliates. NCU may also
contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current
services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>

<p>Northcentral University does not sell, rent or lease its lead, applicant,
Learner, or mentor lists to third parties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The University may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external
business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you.
In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name,
address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition,
NCU may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical
analysis. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal
information except to provide these services to NCU, and they are required to
maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>

<p>Northcentral University keeps track of the Web sites and pages that its
leads, applicants, Learners, and mentors visit within the University, in order
to determine what sites and services are the most popular. This data is used to
deliver customized content and advertising within the University to leads,
applicants, Learners, or mentors whose behavior indicates that they are
interested in a particular subject area.</p>

<p>Northcentral University Web sites will not disclose your personal
information, except if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief
that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or
comply with legal process served on NCU or the site; (b) protect and defend the
rights or property of NCU, or an NCU Web site; and, (c) act under exigent
circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of NCU, its web sites, or
the public.</p>

<p>Under the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 a
Learner’s academic and financial files at the University will not be released
to any third party without the written consent of the Learner.</p>

<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>

<p>Many of the Northcentral University Web sites use "cookies" to
help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is
placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to
you.</p>

<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature
to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you
have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Northcentral
University's pages, or register with University sites or services, a cookie
helps the University to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as
billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same
NCU Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you
can easily use the features that you customized.</p>

<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting
to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not
be able to fully experience the interactive features of the NCU services or Web
sites you visit.</p>

<h3>Use of Web Beacons</h3>

<p>Northcentral University Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web
beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow the University to
count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.
NCU may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or University
Newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted
upon. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable
information on the NCU network of sites and services; they are a technique use
to compile aggregated statistics about University Web site usage.</p>

<p>Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie
number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which
the Web beacon resides. Northcentral University Web pages may also contain Web
beacons placed there by our advertising partner, Avenue A, to help the
University determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.</p>

<h3>Control your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Northcentral University offers its Learners choices for the collection, use
and sharing of personal information. You may go to the Profile page to
proactively make choices about the use and sharing of your personal
information.</p>

<p>You may also stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from
Northcentral University Web sites by following the specific instructions in the
e-mail you receive. The instructions explain how to stop receiving such
e-mails.</p>

<h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Northcentral University secures your personal information from unauthorized
access, use or disclosure. NCU secures the personally identifiable information
you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected
from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Personal information (such as a
credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites through the use of Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection.</p>

<h3>Changes to this Statement</h3>

Northcentral University will occasionally update
this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and leads, applicants, Learners,
or mentors feedback. When NCU posts changes to this Statement, you will see the
word "updated" next to the Privacy Statement link on the front page of
Northcentral University. If there are material changes to this Statement or in
how Northcentral University will use your personally identifiable information,
the University will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the
change. Northcentral University encourages you to periodically review this
Statement to be informed of how NCU is protecting your information.
