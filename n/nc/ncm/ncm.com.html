registrations for each Site may be required.&nbsp; When accessing the portions
of that Site available to account holders, users may be required to provide
their username and password.<br>

<p><br><b>Personally Identifiable Information.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Personally identifiable
information includes information by which you may be personally identified,
either directly or in combination with other information.&nbsp; We only collect
and share personally identifiable information regarding users of the Sites as
described in this Policy.&nbsp; Except as noted in this Policy, personally
identifiable information collected on the Sites is NOT shared with third parties
without your consent. The definition of what is considered personally
identifiable information is subject to change according to the then applicable
law.<br>
<br>
We may automatically collect personally identifiable information from you when
you access the Sites.&nbsp; We may also collect personally identifiable
information from you through a number of voluntary sources on the Sites, such
as responses, registrations, reviews, comments, emails, postings, photographs,
messages, the interfacing with social networking sites or other electronic
submissions and communications sent by you to NCM or the Sites.&nbsp; The

	</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:.25in">YOU SHOULD NOT PROVIDE NCM WITH
ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (OR SUBMIT OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
INFORMATION TO ANY OF THE SITES) UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE THAT INFORMATION TO BE
USED BY NCM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY. LIKEWISE, YOU SHOULD NOT SUBMIT OR
POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO ANY OF THE SITES UNLESS YOU
WANT THAT INFORMATION TO BE ACCESSIBLE BY OTHER USERS OF THE SITE, AS
INFORMATION POSTED ON A SITE MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER USERS OF THAT SITE.<br>
<br>
The personally identifiable information that NCM collects from users of the
Sites (both registered and unregistered) may be used for a variety of purposes,
for example to provide the services and products offered through the Site to
users of that Site, to customize advertising and other content displayed on the
Site and/or the layout of the Site for each individual user of the Site, to
notify users of the Site about updates to and activities on the Site and about
goods and services that we feel may be of interest to you, to improve the
content of the Site, to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Site,
to contact users of the Site for marketing purposes, and to contact users of
the Site for information verification purposes.<br>
<br>
We may also share certain personally identifiable information we collect
through the Sites with third party companies so that they may offer products
and services to users of our Sites that we believe will be of interest to those
users. &nbsp;We may also share certain personally identifiable information with
third party advertisement serving companies to better target the advertising
and other content displayed on the Sites and provide pertinent offers we think
may be of interest to our users.&nbsp; In addition, third party advertisers may
receive certain personally identifiable information about you if you click on
advertisements displayed on the Sites (and clicking on any advertisement
displayed on the Sites will be considered your consent to “opt in” for this
transfer).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Sites have features that allow you to store and share your information or
content with others.&nbsp; The Sites may include features and functions that
allow you to post and share content, messages and reviews to forums, message
boards, chat rooms or bulletin boards.&nbsp; We may record and store archives
of these communications and content on our servers.&nbsp; You acknowledge and
consent to the recording and storage of such communications and content.&nbsp;
If you choose to provide personally identifiable information through use of
these features, that information may be available to a wider community and
individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other
individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge.&nbsp;
We recommend that you think carefully about sharing this type of information,
including through forums, message boards, chat rooms or bulletin boards.</p>

<p><br><b>Movie Night Out Mobile Application.</b></p>&nbsp;

<p style="margin-left:.25in">If you use our Movie Night Out mobile application 
on a mobile device and your settings allow it, we may collect information about 
your location within participating theatres and retail locations through your 
mobile device's Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or similar capabilities  based on the detection 
of signals from nearby proximity beacons and Wi-Fi networks.&nbsp; We will only gather 
these kinds of location information if you agree to share them with us by opting-in 
within the Movie Night Out mobile application (either during your initial login or 
later) and by enabling these capabilities on your mobile device.&nbsp; Once you have 
opted-in to receive offers and information and consented to our use of location 
information, the Movie Night Out mobile application will continue to collect 
location information (even if it is running in the background) until you opt-out
, log-off or use your phone's or other device's setting to disable your mobile 
device's applicable geolocation, GPS, Bluetooth or similar capabilities for the 
application.  Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section below for more information 
on how to limit the location information that we may collect from your mobile device.</p>

<p><br><b>Personal Profiles.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">We may also provide you with the
ability to create a personal profile on a Site containing personally
identifiable information provided by you and to make your personal profile
available to other users of the Sites.&nbsp; You may adjust the scope and
nature of the information you make available to other users of the Sites
through Your personal profile as indicated on the Sites.&nbsp; YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN YOUR PERSONAL PROFILE AND SHARED
WITH OTHER USERS OF THE SITES. YOU SHOULD NOT CREATE A PERSONAL PROFILE UNLESS
YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH OTHER USERS OF
THE SITES.</p>

<p><br><b>Disclosure as Required by Law.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Though we make every reasonable
effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally
identifiable information of certain users of any Site when we have a reasonable
and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the Terms of
Use for the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal
process, or to otherwise enforce or protect NCM's rights under applicable law,
including, without limitation, NCM's intellectual property rights.&nbsp; In
this situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this
disclosure to all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the
circumstances.</p>

<p><br><b>Enhancement of Personal Information.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">We may combine and enhance our
user database information with third party data and information to better
target our advertising and provide pertinent offers in which we think our users
would be interested.&nbsp; Certain summary demographics are also used in our
research product offerings.&nbsp; Individual personally identifiable
information is never used in our research product offering and is never tied
back to an individual user or resold for any purposes.</p>

<p><br><b>Service Announcements.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">On occasion it is necessary to
send out service related announcements.&nbsp; For instance, if our Sites or any
of the services offered through the Sites are temporarily suspended for maintenance
we might send users an email.&nbsp; Generally, users may not opt-out of these
communications, though they can deactivate their account.&nbsp; These
communications are not promotional in nature.</p>

<p><br><b>Special Offers and Updates.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">We may send new registrants of the
Sites a welcoming email to verify password and username.&nbsp; Established
members may occasionally also receive information on products, services and
special deals, and periodic newsletters.&nbsp; Out of respect for the privacy
of our users we present the option to not receive these types of
communications.&nbsp; Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.</p>

<p><br><b>Your California Privacy Rights.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><br>
California law provides that California residents have a right to request that
businesses tell them how their personally identifiable information has been
shared with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing
purposes.&nbsp; However, there is an exception to this requirement for
businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy
of not disclosing a person’s personally identifiable information to third
parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes if that person has
exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their personally
identifiable information to third parties for such purposes.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
NCM has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your
personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing
purposes and thus falls within this exception.&nbsp; Instructions for opting
out can be found in the section below entitled “Choice and Opt-Out.”</p>

<p><br><b>Choice and Opt-out.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">We provide you with a choice
whether to receive certain emails.<br>
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally
identifiable information used for certain purposes.&nbsp; If you are a user of
the Sites and you no longer wish to receive, email, mail, or telephone calls
from us or have your email address or postal address shared with third parties,
you may opt-out of receiving email, mail or telephone calls from us or having
your email address or postal address shared with third parties.<br>
<br>
If you do not want us to use information that we collect or
that you provide to us to deliver advertisements according to our advertisers'
target-audience preferences, you can opt-out by emailing us as set forth below.
In addition, if you would prefer that we not share your personally
identifiable information with third parties for the third parties’ direct
marketing purposes, you may opt-out of having your personally identifiable information
shared with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing
purposes.<br>
<br>
All opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@ncm.com">unsubscribe@ncm.com</a> or
writing us at Attn:&nbsp; Customer Service, 9110 E. Nichols Ave #200,
Centennial, CO 80112.<br>
<br>
We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain information
when you visit our Sites. These companies may use personally or non-personally
identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time
and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your
visits to the Sites and other web sites or applications in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to
you. &nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">We do not control third parties’ collection or use of
your information to serve interest-based advertising.</span>&nbsp; To learn more
about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of
advertising, you can visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network
Advertising Initiative</a>, a coalition of online advertising networks that
provides an opportunity for consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising by
member companies.&nbsp; It should be noted that opting out does not mean you
will not see advertisements online, but these advertisements will not be
targeted based on your online user interest profile.<br>
<br>
If you access any of our Sites through a mobile device, you may adjust the 
settings on your mobile device to allow or prevent the sharing of location 
information. For example, you can disable “Location” (or “Location Services” 
on iOS-based devices) on your mobile device to prevent sharing your location 
information with NCM, or only disable “Bluetooth” to prevent the sharing of 
information collected via nearby Bluetooth proximity beacons.  Please note 
that if you disable the sharing of location information, you may be unable 
to access some features of our Sites that are designed for mobile devices.</p>

<p><br><b>Children.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">The Sites are not directed to
children under 13 years of age and the Terms of Use for the Sites specifically
prohibits use of the Sites by children under 13 years of age.&nbsp; Children
under 13 may not use or access the Sites under any circumstances.&nbsp; If you
are 13 or older and younger than 18, then you may access and use the Site only
if you have your parents' or guardians' prior permission. NCM does not
knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 13 years
of age.</p>

<p><br><b>Customer Service.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">We communicate with users on a
regular basis to provide requested services and with regard to issues relating
to their account, we reply via email, in accordance with the users'
wishes.</p>

<p><br><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Where possible, our server
automatically recognizes each visitor’s Internet Protocol addresses.&nbsp; We
also collect information about how visitors use the Sites (for example what
pages are viewed and products and services are purchased).&nbsp; This
information allows us to improve the content of the Sites and facilitate market
research.&nbsp; Sometimes, we utilize the services of a third party to help us
understand this information better, although the information that is disclosed
to these entities remains at all times in anonymous and non-personally
identifiable form.&nbsp; Other than improving the Sites and the experience of
visitors to the Sites, we make no other use of this information.&nbsp; The
treatment of non-personally identifiable information is subject to change in
accordance with the then applicable law.</p>

<p><br><b>Cookies, Pixels and Web Beacons.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">"Cookies" are commonly
used pieces of information in the form of small files that are placed on an
individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily
communicate and interact with the Sites.&nbsp; We may use cookies for various
purposes, for example to save user preferences, customize content of the Sites
for individual users, to ensure that users are not repeatedly sent the same
banner ads, to record session information, such as items that users add to
their shopping cart, to alert users to new areas that might be of interest upon
return to the Sites, and to save certain information about users of the Sites
and others who visit the Sites, in order to facilitate and enhance interaction
with the Sites.&nbsp; NCM does not use cookies to retrieve information from a
computer that is unrelated to NCM or the Sites.<br>
<br>
A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other personally identifying
information; however, we may link the information obtained through cookies to
other personally identifiable information to give us a better understanding of
your preferences, so that we can provide a more meaningful experience to you on
our Sites.<br>
<br>
We may use an outside advertisement serving company to display advertisements
on the Sites.&nbsp; The advertisement serving company may place and collect
cookies when it displays an advertisement on the Sites.&nbsp; We do not have
access to information that would confirm the use of cookies by the
advertisement serving company.&nbsp; We may also use a third party provider to
analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Sites and such third party
provider may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, tracking agents or any
other visitor identification technology to collect such information.<br>
<br>
Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive,
block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is
stored.&nbsp; Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn
more about these functions.</p>

<p><br><b>Access, Review, Update.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">The users of the Sites should
email us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@ncm.com">unsubscribe@ncm.com</a> to review, delete/deactivate and update the
personal information that was previously provided to us.</p>

<p><br><b>Other Web Sites; Links; Widgets.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Certain of the web sites of NCM’s
affiliates, promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, and other third-party
web sites and third-party widgets are accessible through the Sites.&nbsp; These
third party web sites and third-party widgets have their own privacy and data
collection policies and practices.&nbsp; NCM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTIONS
OR PRIVACY POLICIES OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES. YOU SHOULD CHECK THE APPLICABLE
PRIVACY POLICIES OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES WHEN PROVIDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
INFORMATION THROUGH LINKED WEB SITES AND WIDGETS.</p>

<p><br><b>Consent to the Use of Third Party Providers.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">In addition to the specific third
parties noted in this Policy, NCM may also contract with other third parties to
provide various services to NCM relating to the Sites on an outsourced basis
rather than performing the services itself.&nbsp; For example, NCM may contract
with an email provider to handle the distribution of email messages to members
of the Sites.&nbsp; Likewise, NCM may contract with a web site hosting provider
to host all or a portion of the Sites for NCM.&nbsp; NCM may also contract with
third party mobile providers to enable the mobile user services provided
through the Sites.&nbsp; We may also use a third party provider to serve
advertisements and collect and analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the
Sites.&nbsp; We contractually require these third parties to
keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for
which we disclose it to them, and to execute international data transfer
agreements with European Union-approved standard contract clauses when
required.&nbsp; By visiting the Sites, all visitors consent to NCM providing both
personal and non-personal information received from those visitors to these
third party providers for the purpose of enabling the third party provider to
provide these outsourced services to NCM.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">In addition, all visitors consent
to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their personal and
non-personal information by NCM and these third party providers as follows:<br>
<br>
<u>Cookie and Pixel Information</u>: Cookies and pixels provide NCM and its
providers with the ability to create an ID in order for NCM and its providers
to match collected data to an anonymous machine including:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style:disc;">
		The URLs (or website address) of web pages which have been viewed;
	</li>
	<li style="list-style:disc;">
		The date and time of visit to a web page;
	</li>
	<li style="list-style:disc;">
		Whether the user has clicked on an ad of one of our advertisers, visited their website, or undertaken a transaction with them.
	</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><u>Session Information</u>: This
information relates to user, campaign and interest-based history and is used
for frequency capping and interest targeting. This information is gathered from
websites visited and clicks registered by the user’s machine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><u>Request-based Information</u>:
This information is passed to NCM and its providers by the user’s computer
browser with every request and is stored entirely anonymously for statistical
purposes only:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style:disc;">
		IP (Internet Protocol) addresses - Every device connected to the Internet has an IP address. This cannot be traced to an individual user but can be used for geographic targeting and statistical measurements;
	</li>
	<li style="list-style:disc;">
		Browser type - e.g. Are you using Microsoft Explorer or Apple’s Safari;
	</li>
	<li style="list-style:disc;">
		Computer Operating System - e.g. Are you using Windows Vista or Apple OS.
	</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><u>Mobile Device Information</u>:
This information is passed to NCM and its providers by the mobile
communications with NCM:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style:disc;">
		Mobile phone number;
	</li>
	<li style="list-style:disc;">
		Mobile carrier's name;
	</li>
	<li style="list-style:disc;">
		Unique identifier for a mobile device;
	</li>
	<li style="list-style:disc;">
		Date, time and content of communication with NCM.
	</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>Consent to the Interface with Social Networking Sites.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">In order to enhance your
experience on the Sites, NCM may retrieve and collect information about you
from your account(s) on various social networking sites, but only if you
voluntarily provide it to us, in accordance with the policies and terms of the
applicable social networking site.&nbsp; The information you allow us to access
varies by social networking site, and it is affected by the privacy settings
you establish with the social networking site.&nbsp; By accessing or using the
Sites in connection with a social networking site(s), you authorize us to
collect, store and use in accordance with this Policy any and all information
that you agreed the social network site could provide us.&nbsp; In addition,
some social networking sites have features which allow you to send information
about your activity on the Sites back to the social networking site (for
example, to be published in your profile).&nbsp; If you choose to use these
features, then your activity on the Sites will be shared with the social
networking site(s).&nbsp; Individuals reading this information on social
networking site(s) may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities
without our control and without your knowledge.</p>

<p><br><b>Location Serving.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">As part of the services offered by
the Sites, we may display a map via the Bing Maps API or Google Maps API.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/privacystatement/en-us/bingandmsn/default.aspx" target="_blank">Click
here</a>&nbsp;to view Microsoft's Privacy Policy and <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to view
Google’s Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If you allow a mobile Site to get your location,
we may collect, depending on the capabilities of your mobile device,
information about the Wi-Fi routers closest to you, cell ids of cell towers
closest to you and the strength of your Wi-Fi or cell signal.&nbsp; While we use
this information to return an estimated location, location data may not be
accurate.  Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section above for more information 
on how to limit the location information that we may collect from your mobile device.</p>

<p><br><b>International Users.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">If you are located outside of the
United States, please note that the Sites are hosted on computer servers
located in the United States.&nbsp; Therefore, your information may be
processed and stored in the United States. As a result, United Sates federal
and state governments, courts or&nbsp; law enforcement or regulatory agencies
may be able to obtain access to your information through applicable United
States laws.&nbsp; Your use of a Site or the your submission of any personally
identifiable information to us will constitute your consent to the transfer of
your personally identifiable information outside of your home country,
including the United States, which may have very different date protection and
privacy rules and regulations than in your home country.</p>

<p><br><b>Notification of Changes.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"> If we decide to change this Policy, we will either notify users by way of an
e-mail or post material changes on the Sites so our users are aware of what information
we collect, how we use it, and if we disclose it.&nbsp; Unless we seek and
receive your consent, we will use information in accordance with the Policy
under which the information was last collected. Users may prevent their
information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was
originally collected by emailing us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@ncm.com">unsubscribe@ncm.com</a>.</p>

<p><br><b>Security.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">We will use reasonable technical
and organizational measures to protect the information under our control
against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration,
unauthorized disclosure or access.&nbsp; While there is no such thing as
"perfect security" on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps
to protect your personal information.&nbsp; For example, our policy is that
only those individuals who need your personally identifiable information to
perform a specific job are granted access to that personally identifiable
information.&nbsp; Likewise, all employees and contractors are kept up-to-date
on our security and privacy practices.&nbsp; Furthermore, when NCM transfers
and receives certain types of sensitive information such as financial or health
information, it redirects visitors to a secure server.&nbsp; Finally, the servers
that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure
environment. &nbsp;While we employ the above steps, we cannot ensure or warrant
the security of any information you transmit to NCM and you do so at your own
risk.</p>

<p><br><b>Contact Information.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">All inquiries concerning this
statement and the Sites in general may be sent to <a href="mailto:customerservice@ncm.com">customerservice@ncm.com</a>.</p>

<p><br><b>Transfer of Information.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">If NCM elects, in its reasonable
discretion, to transfer ownership or control of the Sites to a third party,
whether or not in the context of an acquisition of NCM or a merger of NCM with
a third party, you consent to the transfer of your personally identifiable
information and non-personally identifiable information by NCM to that third
party, provided that all use of your information by that third party remains
subject to the terms of this Policy.</p>

<p><br><b>NCM’s California Do Not Track Notice.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">California Business &amp;
Professions Code Section 22575(b)(as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides
that California residents are entitled to know how NCM responds to “Do Not
Track” browser settings. NCM does not currently take actions to respond to Do
Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been
developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once
one is created.</p>
