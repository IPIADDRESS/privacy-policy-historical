            <br>
            <br>
            Amendments to this Policy will be posted on the Sites and will be effective when
            posted. Your continued use of any of the Sites following the posting of any amendment
            will constitute your acceptance of that amendment, except if your personally identifiable

            <b>REGISTERED USERS.</b>
            <br>
            Registration is not mandatory to access the public areas of the Sites. Registration
            is, however, required for access to certain areas of the Sites and the products
            and services provided through those areas of the Sites. The areas of the Sites requiring
            registration are noted on each Site.

            of that Site available to account holders. A username and password on one of the
            Sites may not be valid on all Sites and separate registrations for each Site may
            be required. When accessing the portions of that Site available to account holders,
            users may be required to provide their username and password.
            <br>
            <br>
            NCM is not responsible for any loss or misuse of your username and password. ALWAYS
            REMEMBER THAT IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR USERNAME
            OR PASSWORD WITH OTHERS.

            <br>
            <b>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</b>
            <br>
            Personally identifiable information includes information by which you may be personally
            identified, either directly or in combination with other information. We only collect
            and share personally identifiable information regarding users of the Sites as described
            in this Policy. Except as noted in this Policy, personally identifiable information
            collected on the Sites is NOT shared with third parties without your consent. The
            definition of what is considered personally identifiable information is subject
            to change according to the then applicable law.
            <br>
            <br>
            We may automatically collect personally identifiable information from you when you
            access the Sites. We may also collect personally identifiable information from you
            through a number of voluntary sources on the Sites, such as responses, registrations,
            reviews, comments, emails, postings, photographs, messages, the interfacing with
            social networking sites or other electronic submissions and communications sent
            by you to NCM or the Sites. The personally identifiable information we may collect
            from you will include, by way of example:
            <ul>
                <li>Domain name and IP address;</li>
                <li>E-mail address;</li>

                <li>Income information;</li>
                <li>Financial information, such as account or credit card numbers;</li>
                <li>Mobile phone number, mobile carrier's name, unique identifier for a mobile device
                    and the date, time and content of mobile communications with NCM;</li>
                <li>GPS or other location-based or geo-positioning information;</li>
                <li>Audit Information;</li>
                <li>User-specific and aggregate information on areas of the Sites accessed;</li>
                <li>Username and password information for each Site; and</li>
                <li>Other information volunteered by You, such as information provided through responses,
                    registrations, reviews, comments, emails, postings, photographs, messages, the interfacing
                    with social networking sites (such as a profile photo, birthday and status), or
                    other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to NCM or the Sites.</li>
            </ul>
            YOU SHOULD NOT PROVIDE NCM WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (OR SUBMIT
            OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO ANY OF THE SITES) UNLESS YOU
            WOULD LIKE THAT INFORMATION TO BE USED BY NCM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY. LIKEWISE,
            YOU SHOULD NOT SUBMIT OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO ANY OF
            THE SITES UNLESS YOU WANT THAT INFORMATION TO BE ACCESSIBLE BY OTHER USERS OF THE
            SITE, AS INFORMATION POSTED ON A SITE MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER USERS OF THAT
            SITE.
            <br>
            <br>
            The personally identifiable information that NCM collects from users of the Sites
            (both registered and unregistered) may be used for a variety of purposes, for example
            to provide the services and products offered through the Site to users of that Site,
            to customize advertising and other content displayed on the Site and/or the layout
            of the Site for each individual user of the Site, to notify users of the Site about
            updates to and activities on the Site and about goods and services that we feel

            We may also share certain personally identifiable information we collect through
            the Sites with third party companies so that they may offer products and services
            to users of our Sites that we believe will be of interest to those users. We may
            also share certain personally identifiable information with third party advertisement
            serving companies to better target the advertising and other content displayed on
            the Sites and provide pertinent offers we think may be of interest to our users.
            In addition, third party advertisers may receive certain personally identifiable
            information about you if you click on advertisements displayed on the Sites (and
            clicking on any advertisement displayed on the Sites will be considered your consent
            to "opt in" for this transfer).

            The Sites have features that allow you to store and share your information or content
            with others. The Sites may include features and functions that allow you to post
            and share content, messages and reviews to forums, message boards, chat rooms or
            bulletin boards. We may record and store archives of these communications and content
            on our servers. You acknowledge and consent to the recording and storage of such
            communications and content. If you choose to provide personally identifiable information
            through use of these features, that information may be available to a wider community

            <b>PERSONAL PROFILES.</b>
            <br>
            We may also provide you with the ability to create a personal profile on a Site
            containing personally identifiable information provided by you and to make your
            personal profile available to other users of the Sites. You may adjust the scope
            and nature of the information you make available to other users of the Sites through
            Your personal profile as indicated on the Sites. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INFORMATION
            INCLUDED IN YOUR PERSONAL PROFILE AND SHARED WITH OTHER USERS OF THE SITES. YOU

            <b>DISCLOSURE AS REQUIRED BY LAW.</b>
            <br>
            Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to
            disclose personally identifiable information of certain users of any Site when we
            have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce
            the Terms of Use for the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or
            other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect NCM's rights under applicable
            law, including, without limitation, NCM's intellectual property rights. In this
            situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure to
            all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.

            <b>ENHANCEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</b>
            <br>
            We may combine and enhance our user database information with third party data and
            information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers in which
            we think our users would be interested. Certain summary demographics are also used
            in our research product offerings. Individual personally identifiable information
            is never used in our research product offering and is never tied back to an individual
            user or resold for any purposes.

            <b>SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS.</b>
            <br>
            On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements. For instance,
            if our Sites or any of the services offered through the Sites are temporarily suspended
            for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of
            these communications, though they can deactivate their account. These communications
            are not promotional in nature.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>SPECIAL OFFERS AND UPDATES.</b>
            <br>
            We may send new registrants of the Sites a welcoming email to verify password and
            username. Established members may occasionally also receive information on products,
            services and special deals, and periodic newsletters. Out of respect for the privacy
            of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
            Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.

            <b>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.</b>
            <br>
            California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses
            tell them how their personally identifiable information has been shared with third
            parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. However, there is an
            exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in
            their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s personally identifiable
            information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes
            if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their personally
            identifiable information to third parties for such purposes.
            <br>
            <br>
            NCM has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your personally
            identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and
            thus falls within this exception. Instructions for opting out can be found in the
            section below entitled "Choice and Opt-Out."
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>CHOICE AND OPT-OUT.</b>
            <br>
            We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails.
            <br>
            <br>
            We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable
            information used for certain purposes. If you are a user of the Sites and you no
            longer wish to receive, email, mail, or telephone calls from us or have your email
            address or postal address shared with third parties, you may opt-out of receiving
            email, mail or telephone calls from us or having your email address or postal address
            shared with third parties.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition, if you would prefer that we not share your personally identifiable
            information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes,
            you may op-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with third
            parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
            <br>
            <br>
            All opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:customerservice@ncm.com" target="_blank">customerservice@ncm.com</a> or writing us at Attn: Customer

            We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain information when

            information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject
            of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Sites and
            other web sites or applications in order to provide advertisements about goods and
            services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral

            for the Sites specifically prohibits use of the Sites by children under 13 years
            of age. Children under 13 may not use or access the Sites under any circumstances.
            If you are 13 or older and younger than 18, then you may access and use the Site
            only if you have your parents' or guardians' prior permission. NCM does not knowingly

            <br>
            Where possible, our server automatically recognizes each visitor’s Internet Protocol
            addresses. We also collect information about how visitors use the Sites (for example
            what pages are viewed and products and services are purchased). This information
            allows us to improve the content of the Sites and facilitate market research. Sometimes,
            we utilize the services of a third party to help us understand this information
            better, although the information that is disclosed to these entities remains at
            all times in anonymous and non-personally identifiable form. Other than improving
            the Sites and the experience of visitors to the Sites, we make no other use of this

            individuals who need your personally identifiable information to perform a specific
            job are granted access to that personally identifiable information. Likewise, all
            employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
            Furthermore, when NCM transfers and receives certain types of sensitive information
            such as financial or health information, it redirects visitors to a secure server.
            Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept
            in a secure environment. While we employ the above steps, we cannot ensure or warrant
            the security of any information you transmit to NCM and you do so at your own risk.

            <br>
            If NCM elects, in its reasonable discretion, to transfer ownership or control of

            or a merger of NCM with a third party, you consent to the transfer of your personally
            identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information by NCM to that
