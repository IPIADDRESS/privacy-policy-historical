            discloses NCM’s information privacy practices for each Site and is intended to inform
            registered users and other visitors to the Sites of the data collection and use
            practices of the Sites.
            <br>
            <br>
            Amendments to this Policy will be posted on the Sites and will be effective when
            posted. Your continued use of any of the Sites following the posting of any amendment
            will constitute your acceptance of that amendment, except if your personally identifiable
            information will be used in a materially different manner. See the Notification
            of Changes section below for further information.

            <b>REGISTERED USERS.</b>
            <br>
            Registration is not mandatory to access the public areas of the Sites. Registration
            is, however, required for access to certain areas of the Sites and the products
            and services provided through those areas of the Sites. The areas of the Sites requiring
            registration are noted on each Site.
            <br>
            <br>
            Users registering to receive an account on one of the Sites will be provided with
            a username and password for purposes of accessing their account and the portions
            of that Site available to account holders. A username and password on one of the
            Sites may not be valid on all Sites and separate registrations for each Site may
            be required. When accessing the portions of that Site available to account holders,
            users may be required to provide their username and password.
            <br>
            <br>
            NCM is not responsible for any loss or misuse of your username and password. ALWAYS
            REMEMBER THAT IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR USERNAME
            OR PASSWORD WITH OTHERS.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</b>
            <br>
            Personally identifiable information includes information by which you may be personally
            identified, either directly or in combination with other information. We only collect
            and share personally identifiable information regarding users of the Sites as described
            in this Policy. Except as noted in this Policy, personally identifiable information
            collected on the Sites is NOT shared with third parties without your consent. The
            definition of what is considered personally identifiable information is subject
            to change according to the then applicable law.
            <br>
            <br>
            We may automatically collect personally identifiable information from you when you
            access the Sites. We may also collect personally identifiable information from you
            through a number of voluntary sources on the Sites, such as responses, registrations,
            reviews, comments, emails, postings, photographs, messages, the interfacing with
            social networking sites or other electronic submissions and communications sent
            by you to NCM or the Sites. The personally identifiable information we may collect
            from you will include, by way of example:
            <ul>
                <li>Domain name and IP address;</li>
                <li>E-mail address;</li>
                <li>Contact information (including, name, address, zip code, country, and phone number);</li>
                <li>Age;</li>
                <li>Gender;</li>
                <li>Marital status;</li>
                <li>Occupation and position;</li>
                <li>Employer;</li>
                <li>Income information;</li>
                <li>Financial information, such as account or credit card numbers;</li>
                <li>Mobile phone number, mobile carrier's name, unique identifier for a mobile device
                    and the date, time and content of mobile communications with NCM;</li>
                <li>GPS or other location-based or geo-positioning information;</li>
                <li>Audit Information;</li>
                <li>User-specific and aggregate information on areas of the Sites accessed;</li>
                <li>Username and password information for each Site; and</li>
                <li>Other information volunteered by You, such as information provided through responses,
                    registrations, reviews, comments, emails, postings, photographs, messages, the interfacing
                    with social networking sites (such as a profile photo, birthday and status), or
                    other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to NCM or the Sites.</li>
            </ul>
            YOU SHOULD NOT PROVIDE NCM WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (OR SUBMIT
            OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO ANY OF THE SITES) UNLESS YOU
            WOULD LIKE THAT INFORMATION TO BE USED BY NCM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY. LIKEWISE,
            YOU SHOULD NOT SUBMIT OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO ANY OF
            THE SITES UNLESS YOU WANT THAT INFORMATION TO BE ACCESSIBLE BY OTHER USERS OF THE
            SITE, AS INFORMATION POSTED ON A SITE MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER USERS OF THAT
            SITE.
            <br>
            <br>
            The personally identifiable information that NCM collects from users of the Sites
            (both registered and unregistered) may be used for a variety of purposes, for example
            to provide the services and products offered through the Site to users of that Site,
            to customize advertising and other content displayed on the Site and/or the layout
            of the Site for each individual user of the Site, to notify users of the Site about
            updates to and activities on the Site and about goods and services that we feel
            may be of interest to you, to improve the content of the Site, to analyze data and
            patterns regarding usage of the Site, to contact users of the Site for marketing
            purposes, and to contact users of the Site for information verification purposes.
            <br>
            <br>
            We may also share certain personally identifiable information we collect through
            the Sites with third party companies so that they may offer products and services
            to users of our Sites that we believe will be of interest to those users. We may
            also share certain personally identifiable information with third party advertisement
            serving companies to better target the advertising and other content displayed on
            the Sites and provide pertinent offers we think may be of interest to our users.
            In addition, third party advertisers may receive certain personally identifiable
            information about you if you click on advertisements displayed on the Sites (and
            clicking on any advertisement displayed on the Sites will be considered your consent
            to "opt in" for this transfer).
            <br>
            <br>
            The Sites have features that allow you to store and share your information or content
            with others. The Sites may include features and functions that allow you to post
            and share content, messages and reviews to forums, message boards, chat rooms or
            bulletin boards. We may record and store archives of these communications and content
            on our servers. You acknowledge and consent to the recording and storage of such
            communications and content. If you choose to provide personally identifiable information
            through use of these features, that information may be available to a wider community
            and individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals
            or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We recommend that you
            think carefully about sharing this type of information, including through forums,
            message boards, chat rooms or bulletin boards.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>PERSONAL PROFILES.</b>
            <br>
            We may also provide you with the ability to create a personal profile on a Site
            containing personally identifiable information provided by you and to make your
            personal profile available to other users of the Sites. You may adjust the scope
            and nature of the information you make available to other users of the Sites through
            Your personal profile as indicated on the Sites. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INFORMATION
            INCLUDED IN YOUR PERSONAL PROFILE AND SHARED WITH OTHER USERS OF THE SITES. YOU
            SHOULD NOT CREATE A PERSONAL PROFILE UNLESS YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
            INFORMATION WITH OTHER USERS OF THE SITES.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>DISCLOSURE AS REQUIRED BY LAW.</b>
            <br>
            Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to
            disclose personally identifiable information of certain users of any Site when we
            have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce
            the Terms of Use for the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or
            other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect NCM's rights under applicable
            law, including, without limitation, NCM's intellectual property rights. In this
            situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure to
            all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>ENHANCEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</b>
            <br>
            We may combine and enhance our user database information with third party data and
            information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers in which
            we think our users would be interested. Certain summary demographics are also used
            in our research product offerings. Individual personally identifiable information
            is never used in our research product offering and is never tied back to an individual
            user or resold for any purposes.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS.</b>
            <br>
            On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements. For instance,
            if our Sites or any of the services offered through the Sites are temporarily suspended
            for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of
            these communications, though they can deactivate their account. These communications
            are not promotional in nature.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>SPECIAL OFFERS AND UPDATES.</b>
            <br>
            We may send new registrants of the Sites a welcoming email to verify password and
            username. Established members may occasionally also receive information on products,
            services and special deals, and periodic newsletters. Out of respect for the privacy
            of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
            Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.</b>
            <br>
            California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses
            tell them how their personally identifiable information has been shared with third
            parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. However, there is an
            exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in
            their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s personally identifiable
            information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes
            if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their personally
            identifiable information to third parties for such purposes.
            <br>
            <br>
            NCM has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your personally
            identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and
            thus falls within this exception. Instructions for opting out can be found in the
            section below entitled "Choice and Opt-Out."
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>CHOICE AND OPT-OUT.</b>
            <br>
            We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails.
            <br>
            <br>
            We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable
            information used for certain purposes. If you are a user of the Sites and you no
            longer wish to receive, email, mail, or telephone calls from us or have your email
            address or postal address shared with third parties, you may opt-out of receiving
            email, mail or telephone calls from us or having your email address or postal address
            shared with third parties.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition, if you would prefer that we not share your personally identifiable
            information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes,
            you may op-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with third
            parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
            <br>
            <br>
            All opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:customerservice@ncm.com" target="_blank">customerservice@ncm.com</a> or writing us at Attn: Customer
            Service, 9110 E. Nichols Ave #200, Centennial, CO 80112.
            <br>
            <br>
            We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain information when
            you visit our Sites. These companies may use personally or non-personally identifiable
            information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject
            of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Sites and
            other web sites or applications in order to provide advertisements about goods and
            services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral
            advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the
            <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network
                Advertising Initiative</a>, a coalition of online advertising networks that
            provides an opportunity for consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising by member
            companies. It should be noted that opting out does not mean you will not see advertisements
            online, but these advertisements will not be targeted based on your online user
            interest profile.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>CHILDREN.</b>
            <br>
            The Sites are not directed to children under 13 years of age and the Terms of Use
            for the Sites specifically prohibits use of the Sites by children under 13 years
            of age. Children under 13 may not use or access the Sites under any circumstances.
            If you are 13 or older and younger than 18, then you may access and use the Site
            only if you have your parents' or guardians' prior permission. NCM does not knowingly
            solicit or collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>CUSTOMER SERVICE.</b>
            <br>
            We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and with
            regard to issues relating to their account, we reply via email, in accordance with
            the users' wishes.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</b>
            <br>
            Where possible, our server automatically recognizes each visitor’s Internet Protocol
            addresses. We also collect information about how visitors use the Sites (for example
            what pages are viewed and products and services are purchased). This information
            allows us to improve the content of the Sites and facilitate market research. Sometimes,
            we utilize the services of a third party to help us understand this information
            better, although the information that is disclosed to these entities remains at
            all times in anonymous and non-personally identifiable form. Other than improving
            the Sites and the experience of visitors to the Sites, we make no other use of this
            information. The treatment of non-personally identifiable information is subject
            to change in accordance with the then applicable law.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS.</b>
            <br>
            "Cookies" are commonly used pieces of information in the form of small files that
            are placed on an individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more
            easily communicate and interact with the Sites. We may use cookies for various purposes,
            for example to save user preferences, customize content of the Sites for individual
            users, to ensure that users are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, to record
            session information, such as items that users add to their shopping cart, to alert
            users to new areas that might be of interest upon return to the Sites, and to save
            certain information about users of the Sites and others who visit the Sites, in
            order to facilitate and enhance interaction with the Sites. NCM does not use cookies
            to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to NCM or the Sites.
            <br>
            <br>
            A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other personally identifying information;
            however, we may link the information obtained through cookies to other personally
            identifiable information to give us a better understanding of your preferences,
            so that we can provide a more meaningful experience to you on our Sites.
            <br>
            <br>
            We may use an outside advertisement serving company to display advertisements on
            the Sites. The advertisement serving company may place and collect cookies when
            it displays an advertisement on the Sites. We do not have access to information
            that would confirm the use of cookies by the advertisement serving company. We may
            also use a third party provider to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of
            the Sites and such third party provider may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels,
            tracking agents or any other visitor identification technology to collect such information.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block
            acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer

            <b>ACCESS, REVIEW, UPDATE.</b>
            <br>
            The users of the Sites should email us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@ncm.com" target="_blank">customerservice@ncm.com</a> to review, delete/deactivate and
            update the personal information that was previously provided to us.

            <b>OTHER WEB SITES; LINKS; WIDGETS.</b>
            <br>
            Certain of the web sites of NCM’s affiliates, promotional partners, advertisers,
            sponsors, and other third-party web sites and third-party widgets are accessible
            through the Sites. These third party web sites and third-party widgets have their
            own privacy and data collection policies and practices. NCM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
            ANY ACTIONS OR PRIVACY POLICIES OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES. YOU SHOULD CHECK THE APPLICABLE
            PRIVACY POLICIES OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES WHEN PROVIDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
            THROUGH LINKED WEB SITES AND WIDGETS.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>CONSENT TO THE USE OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS.</b>
            <br>
            In addition to the specific third parties noted in this Policy, NCM may also contract
            with other third parties to provide various services to NCM relating to the Sites
            on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services itself. For example,
            NCM may contract with an email provider to handle the distribution of email messages
            to members of the Sites. Likewise, NCM may contract with a web site hosting provider
            to host all or a portion of the Sites for NCM. NCM may also contract with third
            party mobile providers to enable the mobile user services provided through the Sites.
            We may also use a third party provider to serve advertisements and collect and analyze
            data and patterns regarding usage of the Sites. By visiting the Sites, all visitors
            consent to NCM providing both personal and non-personal information received from
            those visitors to these third party providers for the purpose of enabling the third
            party provider to provide these outsourced services to NCM. In addition, all visitors
            consent to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their personal and non-personal
            information by NCM and these third party providers as follows:
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Cookie and Pixel Information</u>: Cookies and pixels provide NCM and its providers
            with the ability to create an ID in order for NCM and its providers to match collected
            data to an anonymous machine including:
            <ul>
                <li>The URLs (or website address) of web pages which have been viewed;</li>
                <li>The date and time of visit to a web page;</li>
                <li>Whether the user has clicked on an ad of one of our advertisers, visited their website,
                    or undertaken a transaction with them;</li>
            </ul>
            <u>Session Information</u>: This information relates to user, campaign and interest-based
            history and is used for frequency capping and interest targeting. This information
            is gathered from websites visited and clicks registered by the user’s machine.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Request-based Information</u>: This information is passed to NCM and its providers
            by the user’s computer browser with every request and is stored entirely anonymously
            for statistical purposes only:
            <ul>
                <li>IP (Internet Protocol) addresses - Every device connected to the Internet has an
                    IP address. This cannot be traced to an individual user but can be used for geographic
                    targeting and statistical measurements;</li>
                <li>Browser type - e.g. Are you using Microsoft Explorer or Apple’s Safari;</li>
                <li>Computer Operating System - e.g. Are you using Windows Vista or Apple OS.</li>
            </ul>

            <u>Mobile Device Information</u>: This information is passed to NCM and its providers

                <li>Mobile phone number;</li>
                <li>Mobile carrier's name;</li>
                <li>Unique identifier for a mobile device;</li>
                <li>Date, time and content of communication with NCM.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>CONSENT TO THE INTERFACE WITH SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES.</b>
            <br>
            In order to enhance your experience on the Sites, NCM may retrieve and collect information
            about you from your account(s) on various social networking sites, but only if you
            voluntarily provide it to us, in accordance with the policies and terms of the applicable
            social networking site. The information you allow us to access varies by social
            networking site, and it is affected by the privacy settings you establish with the
            social networking site. By accessing or using the Sites in connection with a social
            networking site(s), you authorize us to collect, store and use in accordance with
            this Policy any and all information that you agreed the social network site could
            provide us. In addition, some social networking sites have features which allow
            you to send information about your activity on the Sites back to the social networking
            site (for example, to be published in your profile). If you choose to use these
            features, then your activity on the Sites will be shared with the social networking
            site(s). Individuals reading this information on social networking site(s) may use
            it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without
            your knowledge.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>LOCATION SERVING.</b>
            <br>
            As part of the services offered by the Sites, we may display a map via the Google
            Maps API. Click <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">here</a>
            to view Google's Privacy Policy. If you allow a mobile Site to get your location,
            we will collect, depending on the capabilities of your mobile device, information
            about the wifi routers closest to you, cell ids of cell towers, closest to you and
            the strength of your wifi or cell signal. While we use this information to return
            an estimated location, location data may not be accurate.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>INTERNATIONAL USERS.</b>
            <br>
            If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the Sites are
            hosted on computer servers located in the United States. Therefore, your information
            may be processed and stored in the United States. As a result, United Sates federal
            and state governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able
            to obtain access to your information through applicable United States laws. Your
            use of a Site or the your submission of any personally identifiable information
            to us will constitute your consent to the transfer of your personally identifiable
            information outside of your home country, including the United States, which may
            have very different date protection and privacy rules and regulations than in your
            home country.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES.</b>
            <br>
            If we decide to change this Policy, we will either notify users by way of an e-mail
            or post material changes on the Sites so our users are aware of what information
            we collect, how we use it, and if we disclose it. Unless we seek and receive your
            consent, we will use information in accordance with the Policy under which the information
            was last collected. Users may prevent their information from being used for purposes
            other than those for which it was originally collected by emailing us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@ncm.com" target="_blank">customerservice@ncm.com</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>SECURITY.</b>
            <br>
            We will use reasonable security measures on the Sites to protect the loss, misuse
            and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing
            as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to insure
            the safety of your personal information. For example, our policy is that only those
            individuals who need your personally identifiable information to perform a specific
            job are granted access to that personally identifiable information. Likewise, all
            employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
            Furthermore, when NCM transfers and receives certain types of sensitive information
            such as financial or health information, it redirects visitors to a secure server.
            Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept
            in a secure environment. While we employ the above steps, we cannot ensure or warrant
            the security of any information you transmit to NCM and you do so at your own risk.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>CONTACT INFORMATION.</b>
            <br>
            All inquiries concerning this statement and the Sites in general may be sent to
            <a href="mailto:customerservice@ncm.com" target="_blank">customerservice@ncm.com</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.</b>
            <br>
            If NCM elects, in its reasonable discretion, to transfer ownership or control of
            the Sites to a third party, whether or not in the context of an acquisition of NCM
            or a merger of NCM with a third party, you consent to the transfer of your personally
            identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information by NCM to that
            third party, provided that all use of your information by that third party remains
            subject to the terms of this Policy.
