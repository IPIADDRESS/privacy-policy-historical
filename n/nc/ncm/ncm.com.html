	<br>
	Amendments to this Policy will be posted on the Sites and will be effective when posted.&nbsp; Your continued use of any of the Sites following the posting of any amendment will constitute your acceptance of that amendment, except if your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner.&nbsp; See the Notification of Changes section below for further information.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should contact NCM by e-mail at <a href="mailto:customerservice@ncm.com">customerservice@ncm.com</a>.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	<strong class="heading">Registered Users.&nbsp; </strong>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		Registration is not mandatory to access the public areas of the Sites.&nbsp; Registration is, however, required for access to certain areas of the Sites and the products and services provided through those areas of the Sites.&nbsp; The areas of the Sites requiring registration are noted on each Site.&nbsp;<br>
		<br>
		Users registering to receive an account on one of the Sites will be provided with a username and password for purposes of accessing their account and the portions of that Site available to account holders.&nbsp; A username and password on one of the Sites may not be valid on all Sites and separate registrations for each Site may be required.&nbsp; When accessing the portions of that Site available to account holders, users may be required to provide their username and password.&nbsp;<br>
		<br>
		NCM is not responsible for any loss or misuse of your username and password.&nbsp; <span class="caps">Always remember that in order to protect your privacy you should not share your username or password with others.&nbsp;</span><br>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<strong class="heading">Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp; </strong>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		Personally identifiable information includes information by which you may be personally identified, either directly or in combination with other information.&nbsp; We only collect and share personally identifiable information regarding users of the Sites as described in this Policy.&nbsp; Except as noted in this Policy, personally identifiable information collected on the Sites is NOT shared with third parties without your consent. The definition of what is considered personally identifiable information is subject to change according to the then applicable law.<br>
		<br>
		We may automatically collect personally identifiable information from you when you access the Sites.&nbsp; We may also collect personally identifiable information from you through a number of voluntary sources on the Sites, such as responses, registrations, reviews, comments, emails, postings, messages, the interfacing with social networking sites or other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to NCM or the Sites.&nbsp; The personally identifiable information we may collect from you will include, by way of example:&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>
		<li style="margin-left: 40px">
			Domain name and IP address;&nbsp;</li>
		<li style="margin-left: 40px">
			E-mail address;&nbsp;</li>
		<li style="margin-left: 40px">
			Contact information (including, name, address, zip code, country, and phone number);&nbsp;</li>

		<li style="margin-left: 40px">
			Username and password information for each Site; and</li>
		<li style="margin-left: 40px">
			Other information volunteered by You, such as information provided through responses, registrations, reviews, comments, emails, postings, messages, the interfacing with social networking sites (such as a profile photo, birthday and status), or other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to NCM or the Sites.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		<span class="caps">You should not provide NCM with any personally identifiable information (or submit or post any personally identifiable information to any of the sites) unless you would like that information to be used by NCM in accordance with this Policy.&nbsp; Likewise, you should not submit or post any personally identifiable information to any of the Sites unless you want that information to be accessible by other users of the Site, as information posted on a Site may be made available to other users of that Site.</span>&nbsp;<br>
		<br>
		The personally identifiable information that NCM collects from users of the Sites (both registered and unregistered) may be used for a variety of purposes, for example to provide the services and products offered through the Site to users of that Site, to customize advertising and other content displayed on the Site and/or the layout of the Site for each individual user of the Site, to notify users of the Site about updates to and activities on the Site and about goods and services that we feel may be of interest to you, to improve the content of the Site, to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Site, to contact users of the Site for marketing purposes, and to contact users of the Site for information verification purposes.&nbsp;<br>
		<br>
		We may also share certain personally identifiable information we collect through the Sites with third party companies so that they may offer products and services to users of our Sites that we believe will be of interest to those users. &nbsp;We may also share certain personally identifiable information with third party advertisement serving companies to better target the advertising and other content displayed on the Sites and provide pertinent offers we think may be of interest to our users.&nbsp; In addition, third party advertisers may receive certain personally identifiable information about you if you click on advertisements displayed on the Sites (and clicking on any advertisement displayed on the Sites will be considered your consent to “opt in” for this transfer).&nbsp;<br>
		<br>
		The Sites have features that allow you to share your information with others.&nbsp; The Sites may include features and functions that allow you to post and share messages and reviews to forums, message boards, chat rooms or bulletin boards.&nbsp; We may record and store archives of these communications and content on our servers.&nbsp; You acknowledge and consent to the recording and storage of such communications.&nbsp; If you choose to provide personally identifiable information through use of these features, that information may be available to a wider community and individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge.&nbsp; We recommend that you think carefully about sharing this type of information, including through forums, message boards, chat rooms or bulletin boards.<br>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<strong class="heading">Personal Profiles.&nbsp; </strong>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		We may also provide you with the ability to create a personal profile on a Site containing personally identifiable information provided by you and to make your personal profile available to other users of the Sites.&nbsp; You may adjust the scope and nature of the information you make available to other users of the Sites through Your personal profile as indicated on the Sites.&nbsp; <span class="caps">you are responsible for the information INcluded in YOUR PERSONAL PROFILE and shared with other users of the sites.&nbsp; you should not create a personal profile unless you want to share your personally identifiable information with other users of the SiteS.&nbsp;</span><br>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<strong class="heading">Disclosure as Required by Law.&nbsp;</strong>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information of certain users of any Site when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the Terms of Use for the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect NCM's rights under applicable law, including, without limitation, NCM's intellectual property rights.&nbsp; In this situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure to all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
	<strong class="heading">Enhancement of Personal Information. </strong>&nbsp;
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		We may combine and enhance our user database information with third party data and information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers in which we think our users would be interested.&nbsp; Certain summary demographics are also used in our research product offerings.&nbsp; Individual personally identifiable information is never used in our research product offering and is never tied back to an individual user or resold for any purposes.&nbsp;</p>
	<strong class="heading">Service Announcements. </strong>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements.&nbsp; For instance, if our Sites or any of the services offered through the Sites are temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.&nbsp; Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.&nbsp; These communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
	<strong class="heading">Special Offers and Updates. </strong>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		We may send new registrants of the Sites a welcoming email to verify password and username.&nbsp; Established members may occasionally also receive information on products, services and special deals, and periodic newsletters.&nbsp; Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.&nbsp; Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<strong class="heading">Your California Privacy Rights.&nbsp; </strong>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their personally identifiable information has been shared with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; However, there is an exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s personally identifiable information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their personally identifiable information to third parties for such purposes.&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		NCM has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and thus falls within this exception.&nbsp; Instructions for opting out can be found in the section below entitled “Choice and Opt-Out.”&nbsp;</p>
	<strong class="heading">Choice and Opt-out.</strong>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails.&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes.&nbsp; If you are a user of the Sites and you no longer wish to receive, email, mail, or telephone calls from us or have your email address or postal address shared with third parties, you may opt-out of receiving email, mail or telephone calls from us or having your email address or postal address shared with third parties.&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		In addition, if you would prefer that we not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, you may op-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">
		All opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:customerservice@ncm.com">customerservice@ncm.com</a> or writing us at Attn:&nbsp; Customer Service, 9110 E. Nichols Ave #200, Centennial, CO 80112.</p>
