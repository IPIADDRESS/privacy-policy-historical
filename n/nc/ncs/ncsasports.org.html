IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS THAT MAY APPLY TO YOU. THE PRIVACY POLICY IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_2" id="eztoc1030915_0_2"></a><h2>OUR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY</h2><p>NCSA Athletic Recruiting is committed to respecting your privacy. We recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of the personally identifiable information (or "Personal Information," as discussed below) you may share with us through this website, and we have established this Privacy Policy so you understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information, how we may use your Personal Information and the choices you have about the way your Personal Information is used. To make this Privacy Policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where Personal Information may be collected.&nbsp;</p><p>This Privacy Policy provides notice regarding our collection and use of Personal Information. You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to us. If you choose not to provide the requested Personal Information, you can still visit most parts of our website, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services that involve our interaction with you.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_3" id="eztoc1030915_0_3"></a><h2>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2><p>"Personal Information" means personally identifiable information, in other words, any information that may be used to identify a specific person, such as: first and last name, home or other physical address, email address, other contact information (whether work or home), date of birth, scholastic information (such as school, class/year, class rank, grade point average, awards/honors and extracurricular activities), athletic information (such as sports, positions, awards/honors and records), physical traits and characteristics (such as height, weight and build) and similar information. This Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information collected or submitted through NCSA Athletic Recruiting's website.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_4" id="eztoc1030915_0_4"></a><h2>PROTECTING CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2><p><b>OUR WEBSITE IS NOT DIRECTED TO, OR INTENDED FOR, CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE.</b> NCSA Athletic Recruiting understands that protecting the privacy of young children is important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain Personal Information through our website from users we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is designed to attract users under 13 years of age. No Personal Information should be submitted through our website by users under 13 years of age. If a user under 13 years of age submits Personal Information to our website, we delete such Personal Information as soon as we discover it was provided by a user under the age of 13 and we do not use it for any purpose. If NCSA Athletic Recruiting were to knowingly collect Personal Information from users under 13 years of age, we would do so in accordance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and modify this Privacy Policy accordingly. We encourage parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet, and to inform them of the potential dangers of providing information about themselves over the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p><b>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, OR IF YOU ARE THE PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN OF A CHILD UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO NCSA ATHLETIC RECRUITING THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. INSTEAD, PLEASE CONTACT NCSA ATHLETIC RECRUITING AT (888) 333-6846 AND ASK TO SPEAK WITH ONE OF OUR RECRUITING COORDINATORS.</b>&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_5" id="eztoc1030915_0_5"></a><h2>USE OF OUR WEBSITE AND COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2><p>In general, you may visit and use NCSA Athletic Recruiting's website without telling us who you are and without revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, you may be asked to provide Personal Information, and we may collect and maintain your Personal Information, if you request that we contact you, if you subscribe to email newsletters or our similar communications, if you apply or register to receive our services or if you wish to participate in or receive other products, services or information through our website. You can decline to provide your Personal Information to us, in which case you may not be able to access certain parts of our website and we may not be able to provide certain services to you.&nbsp;</p><p>We may collect Personal Information from you through our website in various ways, such as by asking you specific questions, by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail or feedback forms or by providing online registration forms, questionnaires or other materials which solicit Personal Information.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_6" id="eztoc1030915_0_6"></a><h2>HOW WE MAY USE OR SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2><p>NCSA Athletic Recruiting may use your Personal Information as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li>To provide our services to you.</li>

<li>To respond to communications, inquiries and requests from you, such as responding to an email you send to us.</li>

<li>To send you newsletters, as well as other advertising, marketing and promotional materials and communications.</li>

<li>To inform you of our products, services and promotions.</li>

<li>To offer you information regarding certain products and services of our partners, sponsors, advertisers and affiliates.</li>

<li>To conduct transactions with you through our website.</li>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, when you apply or register through our website to receive NCSA Athletic Recruiting's services, you are agreeing that NCSA Athletic Recruiting may share your Personal Information with third parties as necessary to provide our services to you (such as when a student-athlete's Personal Information is provided to a college coach or athletic director for evaluation).&nbsp;</p><p>We will not otherwise share your Personal Information with any third parties, without your consent, except in the following circumstances:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li>To help us deliver programs, products, information and services, and to conduct transactions through our website or to support the business operations of our website, when our third party vendors or suppliers (such as transaction processors, financial institutions, application service providers, web hosting providers, Internet service providers and technical support providers) may receive your Personal Information in connection with providing their services to NCSA Athletic Recruiting. (However, such third parties are only authorized to use your Personal Information for the purpose of providing their services to NCSA Athletic Recruiting and are required by us to treat your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>In the event that we are party to a business transition, such as a merger, divestiture, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information, in most instances, will be part of the assets transferred.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>To respond to law enforcement requests or, where required by applicable laws, court orders or government regulations.</li>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, you may "opt out" of receiving promotional communications from NCSA Athletic Recruiting either by choosing to "opt out" where such option is made available on our website or at any time by contacting us at the address, phone number or email address shown at the end of this Privacy Policy. We endeavor to process such "opt out" requests within ten (10) days of receipt.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_7" id="eztoc1030915_0_7"></a><h2>COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2><p>NCSA Athletic Recruiting also may collect and maintain information from you that is not Personal Information. Such non-Personal Information may be used for many purposes, including marketing, demographic and/or statistical purposes, and we may share such non-Personal Information with third parties. We may use aggregate non-Personal Information to better design our website, and we may share such information with our partners, sponsors, advertisers and affiliates. For example, we may tell an advertiser that "X" number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that "Y" number of men and "Z" number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose any Personal Information that could be used to identify those individuals.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_8" id="eztoc1030915_0_8"></a><h2>USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2><p>NCSA Athletic Recruiting's website may use "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file stored on your computer that may be used, for example, to collect information about website activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a user.&nbsp;</p><p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you may be unable to use those services or engage in activities on our website that require the placement of cookies.&nbsp;</p><p>Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser software and operating system types, clickstream patterns and dates and times that our website is accessed.&nbsp;</p><p>Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our website and your experience using our website. We may use this information to understand how our users navigate our website, and to determine trends, statistics and common traffic patterns, including what website you came from before visiting our website.<b> </b>&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_9" id="eztoc1030915_0_9"></a><h2>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</h2><p>An IP address is a number that is assigned automatically to your computer whenever you use the Internet. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. NCSA Athletic Recruiting may collect IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, affiliates and partners and to audit the use of our website. When users request pages from our website, our servers log the users' IP addresses. We typically do not link IP addresses to Personal Information. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a visitor if required by law, when disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of our website or to protect any user's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_10" id="eztoc1030915_0_10"></a><h2>SECURITY</h2><p>Wherever your Personal Information may be held by NCSA Athletic Recruiting or on our behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Information we collect and maintain through our website. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we have taken appropriate steps to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or otherwise warrant the security of any Personal Information you provide to us through our website. For additional information about the security measures we employ please contact us at the address, phone number or email address shown at the end of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_11" id="eztoc1030915_0_11"></a><h2>ACCESS/ACCURACY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2><p>To the extent that you provide us with Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on our website, our goal is to provide a means for updating or correcting that Personal Information. You can access and update your Personal Information by logging into your online account and making the appropriate updates. If you have forgotten your login credentials you can retrieve those via our automated password retrieval system.&nbsp;</p><p>You may also update your Personal Information by contacting us at the address, phone number or email address shown at the end of this Privacy Policy. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before making updates or corrections.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_12" id="eztoc1030915_0_12"></a><h2>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h2><p>Our website may contain links or references to third party owned and/or operated websites that we believe might be of interest to users, including websites of our partners, sponsors, advertisers and affiliates. We do not control the content of these third party websites. These third party websites may send you their own cookies, collect data or solicit Personal Information. Once you have clicked on a link to a third party website and leave our website, you must read the privacy policy of the third party website to see how your Personal Information will be handled.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_13" id="eztoc1030915_0_13"></a><h2>UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2><p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the bottom of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1030915_0_14" id="eztoc1030915_0_14"></a><h2>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2><p>A business subject to California Civil Code section 1798.83 is required to disclose to its California customers, upon request, the identity of any third parties to whom the business has disclosed personal information within the previous calendar year, along with the type of personal information disclosed, for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:&nbsp;</p><p>
