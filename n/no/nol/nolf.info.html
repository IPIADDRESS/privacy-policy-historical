                  <p>Nolf.info has implemented following principles in privacy 
                    policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally 
                    identifiable information ("PII") (that is, information 
                    such as your full name, email address, mailing address or 
                    telephone number) we obtain from and about individuals visiting 
                    our site.<br>
                    We do not collect information online via our web site from 
                    children under 13. In addition, we will not obtain PII of 
                    children under 13 from third parties unless those third parties 
                    have complied with the Children's Online Privacy Protection 
                    Act ("COPPA").<br>
                    From time to time Nolf.info may revise this privacy policy 
                    to reflect changes in the law, technology or industry initiatives. 
                    Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are 
                    up to date on our most current policies and practices.</p>
                  <p><b>COLLECTION:<br>
                    Collection of personally identifiable information ("PII") 
                    by Nolf.info<br>
                    </b><i>General.</i> Nolf.info does not collect PII through 
                    internet site located at www.nolf.info. We may, however, collect 
                    PII from you manually in order to create or enhance our relationship 
                    with you. We may also obtain PII about you from a third party, 
                    whether in connection with some form of registration, contest, 
                    poll or otherwise. When we collect PII from you or obtain 
                    PII about you it is because you are voluntarily submitting 
                    the information to us or a third party in order to participate 
                    in activities like contests, games, surveys, forums or some 
                    form of registration, or because you want us to furnish you 
                    with products, services or information. On those occasions 
                    when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable 
                    sources of such information.<br>
                    <i>Cookies.</i> Cookies are small bits of information that 
                    our internet site could place (but there are no cookies present 
                    on our site at this time...) on the hard drive of your computer. 
                    Cookies remember information about your activities on our 
                    site and enable Nolf.info to make your visits to our site 
                    more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your password 
                    for easy logon to a site you have previously visited, can 
                    save your preferences for a personalized home page or can 
                    track the items you have placed in your "shopping cart" 
                    during a visit to online store. Since Nolf.info does not collect 
                    PII online via web site at this time, Nolf.info does not combine 
                    cookies with PII. However, some affiliated sites are (or could 
                    be) run by third party(s), such third party(s) may combine 
                    cookies and other similar tools with your PII.<br>
                    You can also program your computer to warn you each time a 
                    cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, 
                    without cookies you won't (or couldn´t) have access to certain 
                    features available only through this technology (but there 
                    are no such features on our site at this time).</p>
                  <p><b>NOTICE:<br>
                    Nolf.info will provide you with notice about its PII collection 
                    practices<br>
                    </b>When Nolf.info collects PII from you, we will make sure 
                    you are informed about how and why the information is being 
                    collected and the types of uses Nolf.info will make of the 
                    information.<br>
                    This policy also describes the types of other companies that 
                    may want to send you information about their products and 
                    services and therefore want to share your PII (See "Use" 
                    below). However, at the time your PII is collected, Nolf.info 
                    will notify you of your options regarding our use of your 
                    PII, including whether we can share it with other companies 
                    (See "Choice" below).<br>
                    When we collect PII from consumers in manual format, such 
                    as a post card or subscription form, providing detailed notice 
                    sometimes proves impractical. So, instead, consumers will 
                    be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain 
                    the full text of this policy and other relevant information 
                    from us. Even when PII is collected manually, consumers will 
                    always be informed up front how and why the information is 
                    being collected and the types of uses Nolf.info will make 
                    of the information. They will also be given the ability to 
                    choose whether such information may be used for purposes other 
                    than the one for which it was submitted or may be shared with

                    linked to our site(s) or for the privacy practices of third 
                    party(s). Once you've left our Nolf.info site via such a link, 
                    you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third 
                    party to determine how they will handle any PII they collect 
                    from you.<br>
                    Nolf.info web site may also be linked to sites operated by 
                    companies affiliated with our site. Visitors to those affiliated 
                    sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies

                    with this policy and only for the purpose for which it is 
                    submitted, unless other uses are disclosed at the time of

                    Nolf.info may share your PII with companies that are affiliated 
                    with us. Nolf.info may also share your PII with companies 
                    that are not affiliated with us, but would like to send you 
                    information about their products and services. However, you 
                    will always have the opportunity up front to choose whether 
                    we may share your information with such unaffiliated third 
                    parties.<br>
                    Our employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate 
                    business reason to obtain access to your PII. Outside contractors 
                    or agents who help us manage our information activities may 
                    only use PII to provide Nolf.info with a specific service 
                    and not for any other purpose.<br>
                    If Nolf.info obtains PII from a third party, such as a business 
                    partner, our use of this information is governed by this policy.<br>
                    Nolf.info may be required to disclose PII to comply with legal 
                    requirements, such as a court order, and to protect the safety

                    Nolf.info protects the security of PII<br>
                    </b>Nolf.info uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel 
                    and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against
