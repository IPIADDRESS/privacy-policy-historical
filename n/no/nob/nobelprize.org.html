  Privacy Policy </h2>
  
  <h4> Introduction </h4>
 
  <p> Nobel Web AB is responsible for producing the official website
    of the Nobel Foundation, Nobelprize.org. We recognize that privacy
    is important and are committed to protecting your privacy. The
    Nobel Web Privacy Policy applies to data collected by Nobel Web
    through Nobelprize.org. Please read it carefully and feel free
    to contact us, at the address last in this document, with questions
    or comments.</p>
  <p> Nobel Web adheres to all applicable Swedish and EG/EU law. </p>
  <h4><br>
    Information
        we collect and how we use it</h4>
  <p> We offer a number of services that do not require you to sign
    up, register, or provide any personal information to us. In order
    to provide our full range of services, however, we may in certain
    cases ask for and collect personal information in different ways. </p>

  <h4><br>
    How we collect your personal information </h4>
  <p> Some of the services at Nobelprize.org, such as certain educational
    games and interactive services, require registration. To use these
    services, we may ask you for personal information and an account
    password.</p>
  <p> Other services (such as the options to evaluate and rate our
    content) may give you the option of providing personal or demographic
    information, such as your e-mail address, name, address, ZIP or
    postcode, age, gender, preferences or favourites. You can decline
    to submit personal information to any of our services, in which
    case Nobelprize.org may not be able to fully provide those services
    to you.</p>
  <p> E-mails or other communications that you send to Nobel
      Web may be retained in order to process your inquiries,
      respond to your requests or improve our services.</p>
  <p> We collect information about your visit, including the pages
    you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection
    with Nobelprize.org sites and services. We also collect certain
    standard information that your browser sends to every website
    you visit. See 'Web analytics' below.</p>
  <p> Information collected through one Nobelprize.org service may
    be combined with information obtained through any other Nobelprize.org
    service. Except in connection with the Tell a Friend-service,
    as described below, we do not combine data entered by you (such
    as an opinion or rating) with personal data provided by the browser
    (such as the IP address). </p>
  
  <h4><br>
    How we use your personal information </h4>
  <p> Nobelprize.org collects and processes personal information for
    the purposes described in this Privacy
    Policy. Such purposes include: </p>
  <ul>
   
      <li> providing our services to users, including the display
        of customized content; </li>
      <li> providing audits, research and analyses in order to maintain,
        protect and improve our services and technologies; </li>
      <li> aiding the development of new services; </li>
      <li> making services easier to use by eliminating the need for
        you to repeatedly enter the same information; and </li>
      <li> operating and improving our site to deliver the services
        you have requested. These uses may include providing you with
        more effective customer service. </li>
    </ul>

  <p> Personal information collected on Nobelprize.org sites and services
    may be stored and processed in Sweden or any other country in
    which Nobel Web or its affiliates or agents maintain facilities,
    and by using a Nobelprize.org site or service you consent to any
    such transfer of information outside of your country. </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <h4> Newsletters </h4>
  <p> If you have subscribed to News from Nobelprize.org, we will
    send you newsletters . You can stop the delivery of newsletters
    from Nobelprize.org by following the specific instructions in
    the e-mail you receive. </p>
  <p> Nobelprize.org maintains a strict privacy policy for the information
    we collect in order to be able to distribute our newsletters.
    Your e-mail address will not be used for any other purposes than
    the newsletter service and will not be sold or given to any third
    party, or traded in any way.</p>
  <p> We use a double opt-in technique for subscribing to News from
    Nobelprize.org, designed as follows. We send an e-mail for confirmation
    to the entered e-mail address. In order to become a subscriber,
    you have to respond to this e-mail. The purpose is to ensure that
    you are the valid owner of the entered e-mail address and to prevent
    people from subscribing by using other peopleâ€™s e-mail addresses. </p>
  
  <h4><br>
    Cookies</h4>
  <p> When you visit Nobelprize.org, we send one or more cookies to
    your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A cookie
    is a small file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page
    server. The cookie contains a string of characters that can later
    be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to
    you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses
    to your computer. We only use standard first-party cookies, which
    are a communication tag only viewable by Nobelprize.org in the
    same nature as session ids. They are not a third-party cookies,
    which may provide information outside our domain, violating our
    privacy policy. </p>
 
  <h4> <br>
    Nobel Web uses cookies</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> to improve the quality of our service by tracking user trends
      and paths using standard Web analytics software. </li>
    <li> to store your preferences and other information on your computer
      in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly
      enter the same information and to display your personalized
      content on your current and later visits to Nobelprize.org. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you
    can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when
    a cookie is being sent. However, some Nobelprize.org features
    and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. </p>
 
  <h4><br>
    Web analytics</h4>
  <p> When you visit Nobelprize.org, we record some standard information
    about your visit. This information helps us to measure the popularity
    of our documents and to understand how traffic flows through our
    site as well as to assist us in planning new content materials.
    We do not create individual profiles of visitors but only collect
    aggregate data.</p>
  <p> These server logs include information such as your web request,
    IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time
    of your request, referring webpage, plug-ins installed, screen
    size, search terms and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify
    your browser.</p>
  <p> The log files are analysed by standard Web analytics programs.
    In this process the information is non-personalized. We do not
    track individual visits unless you specifically ask us to do so
    (i.e. for solving certain problems) or if our security is violated.</p>
  <p> The log files are retained for as long as is necessary to perform
    the analysis described above, but in no case for a period longer
    than 18 months. </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <h4>'Tell a Friend'</h4>
  <p> Nobel Web has a Tell a Friend service that allows you to inform
    a friend about a page on Nobelprize.org. In this process you enter
    the e-mail address of your friend and possibly your own e-mail
    address, together with a short message. Nobel Web will include
    certain personal information from you, such as the IP address,
    into the e-mail sent to your friend. The same information will
    be stored at Nobel Web for 5 days. The purpose is to protect the
    integrity of the receiver of the e-mail. If the receiver feels
    abused by a sent e-mail, we want to be able to assist in providing
    the information about the sender we know about. Nobel Web does
    not look at this information unless we are specifically asked
    to do so. After 5 days all data is erased, the purpose of which
    is to protect the integrity of both the sender and the receiver,
    since the message sent may contain personal information. </p>
 
  <h4> <br>
    Affiliated sites and links</h4>

  <p> This policy applies to web sites and services that are owned
    and operated by Nobel Web. We do not exercise control over sites
    displayed as links from within Nobelprize.org.</p>
  <p> Nobelprize.org may present links in a format that enables us
    to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use
    this information to improve the quality of our services.</p>
  <h4><br>
    Information sharing </h4>

  <p> Nobel Web only&nbsp;would only share personal information with
    other companies or individuals outside of Nobel Web in situations
    in which we&nbsp;(i) explicitly say we are doing so&nbsp;and&nbsp;include
    a description of the purpose for sharing personal information
    in the form where the information would be collected; or&nbsp;(ii)
    in the following limited circumstances:</p>
  <p> We have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or
    disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a)
    satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
    governmental request; (b) detect, prevent, or otherwise address
    fraud, security or technical issues; and (c) protect against imminent
    harm to the rights, property or safety of Nobel Web, its users
    or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
  <p> We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated,
    non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched
    for a particular term, for example, or how many users used a particular
    service. Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
  <h4> <br>
    Information security</h4>
 
  <p> Nobel Web is committed to protecting the security of your personal
    information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures
    to help protect your personal information and data from unauthorized
    alteration access, use, destruction or disclosure.</p>
  <p> Our measures to protect the security of your personal information
    include: </p>
  <ul>
  
      <li> storing the personal information you provide on computer
        systems with limited access, which are located in controlled
        facilities; </li>
      <li> restricting access to personal information to Nobel Web
        employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information
        in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These
        individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may
        be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal
        prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations; and </li>
      <li> performing internal reviews of our data collection, storage
        and processing practices and security measures, as well as
        physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access
        to systems in which we store personal data. </li>
    </ul>
  

  <p> If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal
    information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.
    If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log
    out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your
    information from subsequent users.</p>
  <h4><br>
    Data integrity</h4>
 
  <p> Nobel Web collects, stores and processes personal information
    only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance
    with this Privacy Policy, and we regularly review our practices
    to ensure that their adherence to this Privacy Policy is maintained.</p>
  <h4><br>
    Accessing and updating your personal information</h4>

  <p> You may have the ability to view or edit your personal information
    online. The appropriate method for accessing your personal information
    will depend on which services you have used.</p>

    the site and to reflect your feedback. When we post changes to
    this policy, we will revise the â€˜last updatedâ€™ date
    at the top of this document. We will post any policy changes on
    this page prior to implementing the change. We encourage you to

    your information.</p>
