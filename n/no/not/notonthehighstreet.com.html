  <h3>what we do with the stuff we know</h3>

<p>At Notonthehighstreet Enterprises Limited (NOTHS), we recognise that privacy and security is a major concern. We have therefore set out below the guidelines we use for protecting your personal information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and check it periodically since it may change from time to time. </p>

<h3>notonthehighstreet's privacy commitment</h3>

<p>The notonthehighstreet.com website is owned and operated by NOTHS. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. We will only collect, store and use your personal information for specific purposes. We use your personal information to support and enhance our relationship with you. We only share your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable laws. You may contact NOTHS at any time with any privacy questions or concerns and to see the personal information you have given us and request correction or deletion.</p>

<h3>consent</h3>

<p>Your use of the notonthehighstreet.com website and any disclosure of personal information via the website signifies your consent to us collecting and using personal information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h3>information about you</h3>

<p>When a customer or partner (this is what we call our sellers) registers at notonthehighstreet.com we ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, and contact details, and then we keep a record of this information. All this is necessary so we can recognise you as a registered customer, pass on the correct details with your order, and ensure that you are happy with the service you receive. 
We keep a record of any purchase you make from any of the partners’ stores at notonthehighstreet.com. This means both they and (in some instances) we can help to deal more quickly with any queries or problems you may have, and also so we can ensure that any information that we send to you is relevant. </p>

<p>We keep a record of any e-mail correspondence you send us, so we can track any problems or concerns you've had with any of the partners' stores on our website. </p>

<p>We'll also ask you questions at registration, and from time to time by email, that will give us information that will be used to improve your experience of shopping at notonthehighstreet.com. You do not have to answer these questions, but if you do we can communicate with you in a more relevant way. </p>

<p>If you would like to revise the information you have provided to us, or feel that what we currently have on record is incorrect, you may update the information by emailing: <a href="mailto:updateme@notonthehighstreet.com">updateme@notonthehighstreet.com</a></p>

<h3>how we use your personal data</h3>

<p>All the information we collect via our website or through correspondence with you is used to operate and improve the service we offer you and to personalise our service. We are committed to using your personal information only for: </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 22px">
<li>Passing on your orders to your chosen notonthehighstreet.com partner(s) so they can supply goods and services to you and for customer administration. </li>
<li>Planning and managing notonthehighstreet.com's business activities, including analysis of customers' shopping habits, product and style preferences. </li>
<li>Technical administration of our website. </li>
<li>Research. </li>
<li>Providing you with information about the services we offer. </li>
<li>Letting you know about offers and news from notonthehighstreet.com. </li>
<li>Letting you know about offers, news and products from partner stores on our site. </li>
<li>Occasionally letting you know about offers from other companies who we believe may interest you, either by sending out the information ourselves to you directly, or by providing certain details to other companies so they may contact you directly. </li>
<li>To verify details of your payment method or credit card account. </li>
</ol>

<p>During your registration process you are given the opportunity to select some of the ways in which we may use your details. See ‘your permission’ and ‘helping us to grow’ below to keep us in touch with anything you specifically don’t want to be informed about.</p>

<p>There are only four circumstances where we may share some of your data with others:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 22px">
<li>In the unlikely event that our business assets are ever sold to or purchased by another company (our data records are part of our business). You will receive notice of any such event and we will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure that the new combined entity will follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy. </li>
<li>To outside research companies whom we may ask to contact you directly for your opinions on our service, and our partners' products and services (in which case we provide them with only the information they need to perform their function). </li>
<li>We occasionally make names, addresses and email addresses available to companies whose products we think may interest you, unless you have subsequently withdrawn that permission. (See 'helping us to grow' below).</li>
<li>If we are requested by the police or a regulatory or government authority investigating illegal activities to provide information concerning your activities whilst using the network we shall do so. </li>
</ol><p>

</p><h3>cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that a website can send to your computer's browser. It's like an internet user's identification card, which tells a website when a user is re-visiting the site. Their ability is limited to containing and transferring to the website as much information as the users have disclosed to that site. Cookies can't read or interfere with other information saved on your hard drive. The notonthehighstreet.com website (in common with most other shopping websites) will not work without cookie</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
