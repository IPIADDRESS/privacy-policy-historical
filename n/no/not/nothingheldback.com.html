<br>
<br>Last Updated: July 29, 2004
<br>
<br>NothingHeldBack.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet 
technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use 
Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, 
telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, 
barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period."
<br>
<br>How we gather information from users
<br>
<br>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the 
activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, 
you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain 
portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when 
you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes 
and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our 
site. Like most Web sites, NothingHeldBack.com also collects information automatically 
and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. 
For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie 
technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other 
things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having 
to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of 
times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we 
adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. 
In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example 
by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be 
unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your 
user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features 
according to your preferences.
<br>
<br>What we do with the information we collect
<br>
<br>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver 
more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not 
share your information with anyone.
<br>
<br>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may 
be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage 
patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our 
site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features 
are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our 
advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any 
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you 
individually.
<br>
<br>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on NothingHeldBack.com 
to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; 
our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by NothingHeldBack.com 
and other topics we think you might find of interest. 
<br>
<br>Personally Identifiable Information collected by NothingHeldBack.com may also 
be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, 
troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes 
and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide 
technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) 
may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by 
law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we 
may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, 
user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your 
information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are 
reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts 
you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate 
or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure 
in such cases.
<br>
<br>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements
<br>
<br>NothingHeldBack.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect 
the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our 
partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through 
our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. 
For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of 
a frame on a NothingHeldBack.com page, certain content that is actually created 
or hosted by a third party. Also, through NothingHeldBack.com you may be introduced 
to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes 
offered by other parties. NothingHeldBack.com is not responsible for the actions 
or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies 
of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated 
by a third party.
<br>
<br>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties 
may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences 
or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served 
by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine 
whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available 
on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or 
other technology to gather information. NothingHeldBack.com does not control the 
use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not 
responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
<br>
<br>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable 
Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed 
publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge 
and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. 
Such activities are beyond the control of NothingHeldBack.com and this policy.
<br>
<br>Children
<br>
<br>NothingHeldBack.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable 
Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we 
discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of 
this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe NothingHeldBack.com 
has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address 
listed below.

<br>
<br>Changes to this Policy
<br>
<br>NothingHeldBack.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please 
check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following 
the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information 
collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the 
rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.
<br>
<br>Governing law
<br>
<br>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Texas law. If a dispute 
arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the help of 
a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Dallas, Texas. Any 
costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be 
shared equally by each of us.
<br>
<br>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through 
mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the following 
location: Dallas, Texas, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. 
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court 
with jurisdiction to do so.
<br>
<br>NothingHeldBack.com is controlled, operated and administered entirely within 
Texas. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and 
do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</font> </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>
