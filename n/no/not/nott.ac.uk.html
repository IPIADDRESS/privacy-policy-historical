   <strong>General</strong><br>
<br>
References in this privacy policy to “we”, “our” and “us”,
etc. are references to us, The University of Nottingham.<br>
We are committed to protecting your privacy and respecting the confidentiality
of information which you provide when you visit our website at <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/">www.nottingham.ac.uk</a>.
At the same time, we want to try to ensure that you obtain full value from our
website and from the services which you may want to receive via our website.<br>
<br>
We are registered as a data controller under the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “1998
Act”). You can see a copy of our entry on the <a href="http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/">Data
Protection Register</a> at. We uphold the relevant
data protection principles and process all personally identifiable information
about you (“personal data”) in accordance with the 1998 Act and other
relevant legislation. This privacy policy explains what information we may collect
about you when you visit our website and how we may use it. <br>
<br>
You should read this privacy policy in conjunction with our website <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/general/terms.phtml">terms
of use</a>, of which this privacy policy forms a part. By agreeing to our
terms of use, you are consenting to our processing of your personal data in accordance
with this privacy policy. Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted on
our web site and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.
<p><strong>The information we collect</strong> <br>
  <br>
  It is possible to use our website without providing any personal data. However,
    we may automatically collect certain information about you when you use our
    website, including by our use of “cookies” (see below), such
    as the IP address of your computer and the dates and times of your visits. <br>
    <br>
  In some areas of our website we may ask you for personal data, such as your
  name, address and e-mail details, that will enable us to make your site visit
  a more rewarding experience for you and/or to contact you after your visit.
  Examples of this might be where you complete an online form asking for a copy
  of a prospectus or to book a place on an open day with us, where you ask for
  information about a job vacancy, or where you subscribe to an online newsletter. <br>
  <br>
  In some other areas of our website, where you can register as an online user,
  we may ask you for more detailed information about yourself. An example of
  this is Nottingham Alumni Online, which, amongst its various other services,
  enables former students to make contact with each other. In order to provide
  these types of services, it may be necessary for us to collect and process
  additional personal data, such as information about your educational history. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How we may use this information</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Personal data which we collect about you via our website is held on and processed
  by computers situated at The University of Nottingham. We will retain this
  data for a reasonable period or for as long as the law requires.<br>
  <br>
  We will not disclose any of your personal data collected via our website to
  any third party, other than in circumstances set out in this privacy policy
  and/or where you have given us permission to do so, unless we are required
  to do so by law.<br>
  <br>
  We may use personal data collected from you via our website to manage and monitor
  use of our website. Otherwise, we will only use this personal data for the
  purposes for which it was collected, unless you have given us permission to
  use it for other stated purposes. For example, if you supply us with your name
  and address so we can send you a prospectus for a particular department, and
  at the same time you agree that we may send you similar information in the
  future, we may subsequently invite you to an open day at that department.<br>
  <br>
  There may be circumstances in which we will ask you to agree to us disclosing
  your personal data to certain third parties, or transferring it outside the
  United Kingdom. However, we will not do this without your permission. For example,
  if you use Nottingham Alumni Online, we may ask you to agree to us transferring
  your personal data to countries outside the United Kingdom, including those
  which do not have equivalent data protection legislation to the 1998 Act. This
  is because some alumni are likely to be located outside the United Kingdom,
  and the global nature of the Internet is such that making personal data available
  to others on our website is likely to involve the transfer of this personal
  data to other countries. However, before transferring your personal data in
  these circumstances, we will do our best to ensure that appropriate arrangements
  are in place to protect your privacy. <br>
  <br>
  If at any time you want to withdraw any permission you have given us to provide
  you with services, or to use your personal data in any other way, please inform
  us by e-mail at 

 
  <a href="mailto:data.protection@nottingham.ac.uk">data.protection@nottingham.ac.uk </a> .<br> 
  <br>
  <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  <br>
  When you visit our website we may send “cookies” to the browser
  on your computer, even if you do not provide us with any personal data. Cookies
  enable us to recognise you (by a unique number allocated to you) when you return
  to our website and so to personalise your return by, for example, customising
  web pages based on which areas of the website were previously of interest to
  you. If you have previously provided us with personal data, then cookies may
  enable us automatically to fill in your name and other information when, for
  example, you complete an online form.<br>
  <br>
  Cookies also enable us to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics which help
  us understand how our website is used and so how we may improve it. It is not
  possible for cookies to read personal information on your computer and/or to
  find out any personal information about you. However, you can refuse to accept
  cookies by modifying the settings in your browser, but this may limit the
  functionality of web pages on our website, or your access to our website. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Subject Access Requests</strong><br>
  <br>
  Under the 1998 Act you are entitled to be told if we hold any personal data
  about you. If we do hold any personal data about you, you are entitled to be
  given a description of the data, to be told for what purposes the data are
  processed, and the people (or classes of people) to whom the data may have
  been disclosed. A request for a copy of information held about you is called
  a “Subject Access Request”. To make a subject access request, please
  contact our Data Protection Officer at the address below. Please note that
  we are entitled to, and do, charge a fee for providing this information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Security</strong><br>
  <br>
  Our website and our computer systems have security measures in place with the
  aim of protecting the loss, misuse or alteration of personal data held by us.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Other websites</strong><br>
  <br>
  Our website may contain links to other websites which are outside our control
  and are not covered by this privacy policy. We are not responsible for the
  privacy policies of any such linked websites.<br>
