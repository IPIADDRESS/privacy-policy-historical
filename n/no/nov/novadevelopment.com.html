			<h1 class="title">Privacy Policy</h1><p>Your privacy is extremely important to us. To better protect your privacy, we are making this privacy policy available to you so you can learn about our online information practices and the way we collect and use your information.</p>

<h2>How Your Information is Collected</h2>

<p>Nova Development ("Nova," "our," "us" or "we") licenses access to our software, services and websites (the "Sites") (collectively, the "Services") to you ("you" or "your"), under our <a href="/company/legal-privacy/terms.html">Terms of Use</a> and any applicable End User License Agreement.</p>

<p>When you place an order on our website ("Sites") or by using our Services, or download, activate or register a product or Service with us, you will be prompted to provide (and we will collect) certain types of personally identifiable information, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, financial information (such as your credit card number) and other unique information such as unique device identifiers, geo-location, user IDs and passwords, transaction information and product and service preferences. We also collect the e-mail addresses of customers who communicate with us via e-mail and those who provide their e-mail address when joining our mailing list. In addition, we collect personally identifiable information that is voluntarily provided to us by visitors to our Sites or who use our Services in connection with activities such as contest participations, survey information and member account registrations.</p>

<p>We may collect non-personally identifiable (anonymous) information from all visitors to our Sites and users of our Services, regardless of whether they place an order with us or download software, volunteer such information, communicate with us, join our mailing list or otherwise. We may use such information and aggregate it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Sites and Services, the number of visitors to each page of our Sites and Services, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Sites and Services. We may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners, or disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Sites and Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

<p>We may also collect information about you from commercially available sources. Such information may include your name, address, email address and demographic data. The information that we may collect from these sources may be used along with the information that we collect from you when you visit the Sites or use the Services.</p>

<h2>Cookies and Other Information Gathering Tools</h2>

<p>Like many sites, we use "cookies." Cookies are small text files that reside on your device and identify you as a unique user. Cookies allow us to, among other things, measure activity on our Sites and Services and to personalize your experience.

We also use other common information gathering tools such as web beacons and embedded web links.</p>

<p>We may also make use of log files in order to track information such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), platform type and date/time stamps. The log files may also contain information we gather that can be used in trend analysis, administration of the site, and overall demography tracking; this information is gathered through the counting of clicks and not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

We may share your information with select business partners so that they may offer products and services that we believe will be attractive to our customers and to those who have subscribed to our mailing list.</p>

<p>In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties in order to: (i) respond to the requests of police and governmental authorities, (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order, (iii) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect our rights or (iv) protect the personal safety of our employees and third parties. We may also share your information with or transfer it to third parties for business reasons, such as in the context of the sale or merger of our company or business.</p>
