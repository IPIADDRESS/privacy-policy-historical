	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p>
		Noodle.org connects people with educational options and opportunities. To do a good job at this, we learn about you by asking you questions, paying attention to what you do on the site, and, with your consent, by bringing over information from Facebook or other social networks. If you request us to, we will forward some of this information to education providers. As with most sites, you may also elect to be contacted by service providers we think offer you something of value, without having to select that option each time.
	</p>

	<p>
		Noodle also offers tutoring services, and allows you to enroll in our programs as well as those of others. Enrolling in a course or program may require additional information related specifically to that transaction.
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, we allow all our users to share with others (on Noodle and on social networks like Facebook) information about themselves, the results of their Noodle activities, and to invite their friends to join them. Whether and how much to participate is up to you.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this document, we’ll attempt to explain as clearly as possible what we do with your personal information, and how you can control those uses.
	</p>

	<h3>What information do we collect?</h3>

	<p>
		You don’t have to register to use the site, but many of its features require an account to which we can save information about you. When you attempt to use one of those features, you’ll be asked to register.
	</p>

	<p>
		We collect information from you when you register, and then as you engage in Noodle searches. Setting up an account requires a valid email address, and a name by which we can address you. We may also ask what sex you are, whether you’re a student, a parent, or an educator, and your zip code, so we can get a sense of who you are, and tailor your experience more closely to your needs.
	</p>

	<p>
		Depending on what you’re searching for (an elementary school or test prep for your child, a college or grad school for yourself, study abroad, etc.) we may ask questions about where you live, what your needs or interests are, and other similar things. In some searches we may ask you a question that seems strange. (“If you were a flower, how would you smell?”) Almost always it’s because the answer says something about what you’ll find rewarding or enjoyable in an educational experience. All of these questions are optional, though the more you answer the better our suggestions become.
	</p>

	<h3>Cookies and Tracking</h3>

	<p>
		Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer through your Web browser that enables the sites to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information in order to track visits, gather general visitor information, and customize and enhance your experience.
	</p>

	<p>
		Every browser allows you to control which cookies you’ll accept, or to reject them entirely. As with many sites, Noodle requires you to accept cookies in order to perform its most useful functions.
	</p>

	<h3>What do we use your information for?</h3>

	<p>
		The information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To personalize your experience.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If we know you’re interested in grad schools we won’t waste your time with college info. If you tell us you’re a parent, we’ll try to show you educational opportunities your kids will enjoy.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To make Noodle better.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We continually strive to improve our service based on what our users tell us and how they use the site.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To send you periodic emails.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		With your permission, we may send you information and updates pertaining to what you’re looking for. We may also send occasional company news, updates, promotions, related product or service information, etc. You can tell us not to at any time by going here and we also include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email we send. You can also get these updates through our Twitter feed or Facebook page rather than by email.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To stay in business.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Noodle makes money by matching people who are looking for an education-related service with the most appropriate providers. When you click the “Contact” or “I’m Interested” button, we forward relevant information about you, including what you’re looking for, where you live, and how to get in touch with you. Depending on what you’re seeking (particularly in the case of colleges and grad schools) we may send more, like the name of your high school, your interests, GPA, etc. You can control what we send here; in general the more info you share, the more interested (and, potentially, interesting) schools will consider you, and treat you accordingly.
	</p>

	<p>
		For service providers like prep courses, tutors, summer camps, and the like we send your basic contact information along with what you’re seeking. If you enroll with a provider on our site (including with Noodle’s own tutors) we may ask for payment information, typically a credit card, so we can complete the transaction.
	</p>

	<h3>How do we protect your information?</h3>

	<p>
		We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you access your personal information.
	</p>

	<p>
		These security measures include: password protected directories and databases to safeguard your information and SSL (Secure Sockets Layered) technology to ensure that your information is fully encrypted and sent across the Internet securely.
	</p>

	<p>
		We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our database to be only accessed by those authorized with special access rights to our systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
	</p>
	<p>No credit card numbers are stored on our site.</p>

	<h3>Third-party links</h3>

	<p>
		On our site you’ll find links to information providers and partners. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies that may differ from ours, and we have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our users and welcome any feedback about these sites that you can provide.
	</p>

	<p>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</p>
	<p>
		Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.
	</p>

	<p>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</p>
	<p>
		We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) and do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.
	</p>

	<h3>Your Consent, and changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>

	<p>
		If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page and on our Twitter and Facebook accounts, send an email notifying you of any changes, and/or update the Privacy Policy modification date below. Policy changes will apply only to information collected after the date of the change.
	</p>

	<p>This policy was last modified on 01/18/11</p>

	<h3>Contacting us</h3>

	<p>
