NoodleTools, Inc. is the sole owner of any information collected on our site or 
for subscription registration purposes, including all customer and billing contact 
information.  Usernames, passwords, and IP ranges collected for the purpose of site

<b>Cookies</b>
<br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user.
Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies ARE required for certain parts

<b>Log Files &amp; Usage Statistics</b>
<br>
Log files are generated by the ISP that hosts the NoodleTools Web site. These log files contain 
information about the users that access the site, including IP addresses. In order to compile usage
statistics for subscribing organizations, we also record the date and time that users log in to the
system, and from what IP address they log in from.

<b>Sharing</b>
<br>
We share no data or information with any of our partners or advertisers.

<b>Links</b>
<br>
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that NoodleTools, Inc. is 
not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We 
encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable

<b>Tell-A-Friend</b>
<br>
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, 
we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. NoodleTools, Inc. will 
automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the 
site. NoodleTools, Inc. sends the email immediately, and does not store the name

<b>Security</b>
<br>
NoodleTools, Inc. does not consider the data transmitted on the Web site to be confidential, 
so there is no need at this time to handle the transmitted data in a secure fashion (SSL). 
Bibliographies generated by NoodleBib, for example, are stored in a non-secure location 
of the Web server, and are potentially (although not easily) accessible to any other Internet user. For this 
reason, NoodleBib should not be used for sensitive or confidential material. If you have any 
questions about the security at our website, you can contact us via the 
<a href="contact.php" target="_blank">NoodleTools Contact Form</a>.
