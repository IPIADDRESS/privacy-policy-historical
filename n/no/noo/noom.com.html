Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser User uses will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe’s web site www.adobe.com.

The code is temporarily downloaded onto User’s Device from Noom’s web server and/or Mobile App or a third party service provider, is active only while User is connected to the Website and/or Mobile App, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p>•<strong> ETag, or entity tag</strong>. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.<br>
Noom may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<p>• <strong>Strictly Necessary</strong>. Noom may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that Noom considers is strictly necessary to allow User to use and access Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services, including cookies required for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, or to improve.</p>

To the extent Noom combines any non-personally identifiable information Noom receives from those sources with User’s Personal Information Noom collect on the Website, Mobile App and Services, it will be treated as Personal Information and Noom will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless Noom has disclosed otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Interactions with Third-Party Websites</strong></p>
<p>The Website, Mobile App and Services may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Website, Mobile App and Services and User’s account on a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to Noom. For example, when User registers with the Website and/or Mobile App, User may have an option to use User’s Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Website, Mobile App and Services or otherwise link accounts. If Noom offers and User chooses to use this functionality to access Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about User to the Website and/or Mobile App. If so, Noom will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since Noom is collecting it as a result of User’s accessing of and interaction on Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services. In addition, Noom may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Website, Mobile App and Services to facilitate User’s sending a communication from the Website, Mobile App and Services. For example, Noom may use third parties to facilitate emails, text messages, blog postings, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to Noom’s Privacy Policy. Noom may not control or have access to User’s communications through these third parties. Further, when User use third-party sites or services, User is using their services and not Noom’s services and they, not Noom, are responsible for their practices. User should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on Noom’s Website.</p>
<p><strong>How Noom Uses the Personal Information</strong></p>

Noom does not share User’s Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Noom may provide to third parties information about User that does not allow User to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services. For example, Noom might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit and/or use Noom’s Services, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of Noom’s Services, or the activities that users engage in while on Noom’s Website and/or Mobile App.</p>
<p>In connection with the Business Premium Services, the Business Customer may disclose certain Personal Information to Noom. To the extent that Noom collects and processes Personal Information supplied by the Business Customer, Noom is considered to be the data controller for the purposes of European data protection legislation and Noom will process User’s Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

• to provide User with information relating to any events held by Noom, where User has consented to be contacted for such purposes; and<br>
• to provide User with access to User’s personal account.</p>

Personal Information may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for Noom for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which User has subsequently consented. For example, sometimes a third party may have access to User’s Personal Information in order to support Noom’s information technology or to handle mailings on Noom’s behalf.

<p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice</strong><br>
On September 27, 2013, California enacted A.B. 370, amending the California Online Privacy Protection Act to require website operators like us to disclose how we respond to “Do Not Track Signals”; and whether third parties collect personally identifiable information about users when they visit us.</p>
<p>(1) We do not track users, who do not interact with its sharing functionality across the web, and therefore do not use “do not track” signals.<br>
(2) We do not authorize the collection of personally identifiable information from our users for third party use through advertising technologies without separate member consent.</p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 also permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@noom.com">support@noom.com</a>. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year.<br>
Personal Information Access and Corrections</p>
<p>Upon receipt of User’s written request and upon Noom’s receipt of enough information to permit Noom to identify User’s Personal Information, Noom will disclose to User the Personal Information Noom holds about User. Noom will also correct, amend or delete any Personal Information that is inaccurate and notify any third party recipients of the necessary changes. User may update any information User has given to Noom by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@noom.com">support@noom.com</a>. Requests to delete Personal Information are subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations imposed on Noom.</p>
<p><strong>Our Accountability/Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Noom uses a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this Privacy Policy and periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the promises in this policy. Noom encourages interested persons to raise any concerns using the contact information provided and Noom will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with this policy.</p>
<p><strong>Noom International Website Visitors</strong></p>
<p>Noom’s Service is operated in the United States. If User is located outside of the United States, please be aware that information Noom collects, including Personal Information, will be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which User is located, and User’s Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. U.S. law may not provide the degree of protection for Personal Information that is available in other countries. Noom takes commercially reasonable steps to ensure that User’s data is treated securely, including entering into appropriate data transfer agreements. By using the Service or providing Noom with any information, User consents to the transfer to, and processing, usage, sharing and storage of User’s information, including Personal Information, in the United States as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If User does not consent to such transfer, User may not use this Website.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transitions</strong></p>
<p>In the event Noom goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another organization, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, User’s Personal Information might be among the assets transferred. User will be notified via this Website of any such change in ownership or control of User’s Personal Information.</p>
