<span class="black_head">Cookies</span><br><br>
A "cookie" is a small text file that a website can place on your computer's hard drive in order to collect information about your activities on the website. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you have the option to change your browser settings to decline them.

<span class="black_head">Website</span>  <span class="brown_head"> Tracking Software</span><br><br>

In addition, if you click on certain "banner ads" or other third-party advertisements on our Website that link you to third-party owned and/or operated websites (please also see "Other Websites," below), we may use tracking software provided by third-party vendors to track your "clicks" and/or your other responses to such third-party advertisements (including whether you make purchases from any such third-party advertiser through the third-party's website), to help calculate commissions that we may have earned from such third-party advertisers for such "clicks" and other responses to third-party advertisements on our Website. This tracking software may also help us and third-party advertisers measure the effectiveness of third-party advertisements on our Website. This tracking software captures certain information about your IP address and also uses "cookies." As noted in the "Cookies" section, above, you have the option to adjust your browser settings to decline certain "cookies." <br><br>
