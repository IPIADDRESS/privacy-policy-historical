We collect information about you when you provide us your information through forms, requests for information, applications for a school (i.e., Apply Online Program), use of our service to store your data on the THOTMATRIX.com profile, or through other communications and interactions you have with us via our website, email or telephone. When you submit information to us, you are doing so on a completely voluntary basis, at your sole discretion and will. Many times the information you submit is required to obtain the benefit, assistance or service you are requesting or would like to obtain from us-for instance, to use our form completion services on THOTMATRIX.com, or to obtain information about a school.

<span class="black_head">IP</span>  <span class="green_head">Addresses</span><br><br>
We collect IP addresses. Your IP address is used to gather broad and specific demographic information as well as for validation purposes. In addition, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. (Please also see “Web Site Tracking Software,” below.)<br><br>


<span class="black_head">Cookies</span><br><br>
A "cookie" is a small text file that a website can place on your computer's hard drive in order to collect information about your activities on the website. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you have the option to change your browser settings to decline them. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so that you do not have to re-enter it each time that you visit our Website (if you choose), and for other purposes. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. (Please also see “Web Site Tracking Software,” below.)<br><br>


<span class="black_head">Website</span>  <span class="green_head"> Tracking Software</span><br><br>
Web servers, or those of third-party vendors, utilize certain tracking software to capture your domain name address (the address of your Internet service provider) for purposes of tracking Website statistics. However, we do not capture any personally identifiable information in our website tracking software.  The capture of your domain name is a common practice among websites for measuring the number of hits, pages visited, and length of user session. We use this information to measure the effectiveness of the Website offerings in order to service you better.<br>

In addition, if you click on certain “banner ads” or other third-party advertisements on our Website that link you to third-party owned and/or operated websites (please also see “Other Websites,” below), we may use tracking software provided by third-party vendors to track your “clicks” and/or your other responses to such third-party advertisements (including whether you make purchases from any such third-party advertiser through the third-party’s website), to help calculate commissions that we may have earned from such third-party advertisers for such “clicks” and other responses to third-party advertisements on our Website. This tracking software may also help us and third-party advertisers measure the effectiveness of third-party advertisements on our Website. This tracking software captures certain information about your IP address and also uses “cookies.” As noted in the “Cookies” section, above, you have the option to adjust your browser settings to decline certain “cookies.” <br><br>

<span class="black_head">Security </span><br><br>
Information we maintain about you is stored in a secure manner. We use security features to collect the information you provide to us via our Website in a secure manner. However, if you send us an email, that type of transmission of information is not secure, and is traveling though the Internet unprotected and can be intercepted.  The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information on our registration or profile forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
