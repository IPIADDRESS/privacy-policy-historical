							<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
							<h3>Privacy Code</h3> <p>At Loblaw Companies Limited and its subsidiaries and divisions, including President's Choice Financial (collectively, "Loblaw", "we", "us", "our"), the protection of personal information has always been of great importance.&nbsp; Loblaw is committed to maintaining the accuracy, confidentiality, integrity and security of your personal information.&nbsp; This Privacy Code is based on the requirements of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA"), as well as applicable provincial privacy laws and is part of our commitment to ensuring that personal information in our possession is protected and is only collected, used and disclosed in accordance with applicable laws.</p> <p>Certain subsidiaries and divisions of Loblaw Companies Limited may develop a privacy policy (each a "Privacy Policy"), to explain in greater detail how they collect, use and disclose personal information in accordance with this Privacy Code.&nbsp; An example of such a policy is the Privacy Policy that applies to President's Choice Financial products and services (which Privacy Policy is available online at <a href="http://www.pcfinancial.ca">www.pcfinancial.ca</a>).&nbsp; In addition, some providers of products and services are companies with whom we have a co-venture relationship and in those cases, the co-venturer's privacy policy applies to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by that co-venturer.&nbsp; </p>  <h3>What is personal information?</h3> <p>Personal information is any information about an identifiable person, other than certain business contact information.&nbsp; It can include such things as a person's home address, date of birth, social insurance number, medical and financial information.&nbsp; The type of personal information that is collected from you also depends on the nature of the transaction.&nbsp; Here are some examples of the type of personal information we collect, use and/or disclose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p><strong>Retail</strong>:&nbsp; In stores, Loblaw will collect and use such personal information as is necessary to process your transaction, including verifying your identity when required.&nbsp; You may be asked to provide personal information when returning products which information is only used in the protection of Loblaw's business.&nbsp; You may also be asked to provide your prescription and non-prescription use, home address and telephone number, date of birth, health insurance information and the name of your health care provider in order to receive prescription services from us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>  <p><strong>Online</strong>:&nbsp; Loblaw asks for your name, address, email address, and other personal information when you create an account online.&nbsp; You will also be asked for personal information when you make an online purchase (so that we can process your order) and when you enter contests; and if your personal information is to be used for other purposes, your consent will be obtained.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h3>The 10 Privacy Principles</h3> <p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Accountability</strong> </p> <p>Loblaw is responsible for personal information under its control, including any personal information disclosed to third parties for handling or administrative purposes.&nbsp; Loblaw has designated a national Privacy Officer and other privacy officers at the local, area, subdivision or division specific level, who are accountable for Loblaw's compliance with this Privacy Code, with any Privacy Policy that applies to you and with privacy legislation.</p> <p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Identifying Purposes </strong></p> <p>The purposes for which personal information is collected will be identified by Loblaw at or before the time the information is collected, unless such purposes are obvious.&nbsp; When we intend to use your personal information for a purpose not identified to you when the information was collected, we will identify the new purpose to you prior to use.</p> <p>With your consent, we collect personal information about you for various purposes, including the following: </p><ul> <li>To verify your identity and protect each party from error and fraud </li> <li>To verify your eligibility for, and to provide you with, products and services </li> <li>To track and analyze your use of products and services (including the number of transactions by type, product code information, brand, etc.), shopping patterns, and the channels you use to obtain those products and services, to help us serve you better, and to provide you with information about other products and services which Loblaw believes may be of interest to you </li> <li>To manage and develop Loblaw's business and operations </li> <li>To generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use </li> <li>To meet legal and regulatory requirements </li> <li>To fulfill any other purpose set out in the Privacy Policy of any subsidiary or division of Loblaw Companies Limited that applies to you. <br></li></ul><p></p> <p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Consent</strong> </p> <p>Loblaw will only collect, use or disclose your personal information with your knowledge and consent, except where otherwise required or permitted by law.&nbsp; Consent means voluntary agreement to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information for defined purposes.&nbsp; Loblaw will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, unreasonably require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond what is required in the circumstances.&nbsp; The way in which consent is obtained may vary depending on the circumstances and the type of personal information involved.&nbsp; </p>  <p>Consent may be express (given orally, electronically or in writing) or implied (provided by an action or inaction), and can be provided directly by you or by an authorized representative.&nbsp; For instance, in a Loblaw pharmacy, with some medications, we will ask for written consent to provide your personal information for the purpose of providing direct mailings to assist you with your medication.&nbsp; On the other hand, when you provide us with your personal information and prescription drug plan information for the purpose of processing insurance payment of prescription drug costs by third parties, this constitutes implied consent.&nbsp; In the same way, when you order flowers for delivery, certain basic information will be collected from you and this also will constitute implied consent for Loblaw to use that information for the purpose of processing your order and delivering the flowers. </p> <p><strong>Refusal or Withdrawal of Consent</strong>:&nbsp; You may refuse to consent or you may withdraw your consent to the continued collection, use or disclosure of your personal information or tell us that you do not wish to receive any marketing communications from us at any time on sufficient notice to Loblaw.&nbsp; We will do our best to accommodate your request, subject to legal or contractual restrictions, current industry standards and our technical abilities.&nbsp; Your withdrawal of consent may result in Loblaw becoming unable to provide or continue to provide you with certain services, products or benefits, and in such case you will be given notice of the implications of the withdrawal of your consent so that you can make an informed decision.&nbsp; Due to printing and distribution schedules, you may continue to receive some communications that were in process before we received your request.&nbsp; If you have a product or service with a subsidiary or division of Loblaw Companies Limited or with a co-venturer, you also may have to refuse to consent or withdraw your consent with that subsidiary, division or co-venturer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>  <p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Limiting Collection </strong></p> <p>Loblaw will only collect personal information which is necessary for the purposes identified and will only collect such information by lawful means.</p> <p><strong>Collection of Information over the Phone</strong>:&nbsp; We may monitor and / or record your telephone discussions with our representatives for our mutual protection, to establish a record of the information you provide, to take or verify instructions from you, to maintain quality service levels, and to assist in staff training.&nbsp; If you are not comfortable with having your telephone calls recorded, you will, where possible, have the option of communicating with us by other means. </p> <p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention </strong></p> <p>Personal information will not be used for purposes other than those for which it was collected without your consent.&nbsp; </p> <p>Loblaw may disclose your personal information, including as follows: </p><ul> <li>With your consent; </li> <li>To carefully select third party service providers that perform services for us or on our behalf and that we have confirmed use security and privacy standards comparable to ours;
