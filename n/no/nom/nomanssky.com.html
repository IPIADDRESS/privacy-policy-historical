<h3>3. WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h3>
<p class="text--centered"><strong>To provide the Online Services to you</strong></p>
<p>We will use information about you (including Basic Information, Registration Information, Analytics and User Content) for delivering our Games to you under the terms of use agreed between us. The processing of information in this way is necessary for us to record your progress and current status within a Game, and to ensure the Games deliver the features promised and function properly, so that you have the best experience when playing any one of our Games and using the Online Services.</p>
<p class="text--centered"><strong>To record discoveries in No Man’s Sky</strong></p>
<p>On of the key elements of our Game No Man’s Sky is exploration. When exploring the No Man’s Sky environment, you may discover planets, alien bases, flora and fauna. If you are the first to do so, your discovery will be named after you, based on your No Man’s Sky username. Those names are viewable by other players.</p>
<p>As this is a feature of No Man’s Sky, we process this information in order to deliver No Man’s Sky to you under the terms of use agreed between us.</p>
<p>If you decide to stop playing No Man’s Sky, we will continue to use your username as the basis of the name of your discoveries. We do this in the pursuit of our legitimate interests.</p>
<p class="text--centered"><strong>To help us improve the Online Services and fix any problems</strong></p>
<p>We may process information about you (including Basic Information, User Content, Registration Information, and Analytics) so that we can analyse and improve our Games and Online Services.</p>
<p>This processing is also necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests of (i) ensuring that our Online Services function properly so that you and other users have the best experience when playing any of our Game(s) and using the other Online Services; (ii) improving the quality of our Online Services and providing a better experience to our users; and (iii) identifying and correcting any bugs in the Games and Online Services.</p>
<p class="text--centered"><strong>To respond to your enquiries and requests for support and to enable you to use the Forums and Help Centre</strong></p>
<p>We may process Support Information and User Content so that we are able to properly respond to your enquiries and support requests either via the Help Centre and we may process Forum Information and User Content so you are able to use the Forums, in accordance with the terms of use agreed between us.</p>
<p>Zendesk helps us to operate our Help Centre and process Support Information for us.&nbsp; Studios Alice &amp; Smith and Moov2 help us offer our Forums and process Forum Information and User Content for us.</p>
<p class="text--centered"><strong>For recruitment</strong></p>
