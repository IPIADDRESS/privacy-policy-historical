      <p> Two features make Insanity Deals™ extremely easy to spot.  First, the purple box.  These deals will appear in a purple box on top of one of the 9 nomorerack deal spots.  As soon as the deal sells out that box will disappear andthe original nomorerack deal will take its spot.  Second, the mind blowing discounts.  We don't call these Insanity Deals™ for nothing.  These discounts on high ticket fashion and electronics are unheard of anywhere else on the Web. </p>

      	<strong>When do Insanity Deals appear on the site?</strong>
        Due to their completely insane nature, there is no set time or day when these deals appear. Keep checking back to make sure you don’t miss out on a great bargain.
        <strong>How many of each product do you sell each month?</strong>
        There are at least 30 of each item and thousands can be sold at different times. The numbers sold on each day or week vary.
        <strong>What are the rules on how many Insanity Deals I can buy?</strong>
Limit is one Insanity Deal WIN per location (based on IP Verification through our system) in 30 Days and a total of 2 within 90 Days (once the 30 days has passed). FOR COMPLETE rules on Insanity Deal Wins, please refer to our FAQ's.
      </div>
      <div class="col">
       <strong> How long do Insanity Deals stay live on the site?</strong>
        This varies from deal to deal, but considering our large customer base and the exclusive prices of these must-have products, most only stay on the site for a few minutes before they’re sold out.
        <strong>How can I improve my chances of getting an Insanity Deal?</strong>
        Keep your eyes on the site regularly and register as a nomorerack™ member so you can login in advance and save your billing and shipping information. That way, when you spot an insanity deal, you can check out really quickly.
        <strong>I added an Insanity Deal to my cart, but when I tried to check out it said it was sold out. Why?</strong>
        As with all our deals, products are not exclusively yours until you have finished the check-out process. While they’re in your cart other users can also pick them up. Be speedy and check out as soon as you click on the deal to make sure you don’t lose it.
