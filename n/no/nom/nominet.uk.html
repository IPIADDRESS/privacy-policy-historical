<p>MARKETING</p>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.</p>
<p>PROMOTIONAL OFFERS FROM US</p>
<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>
<p>THIRD-PARTY MARKETING</p>
<p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the Nominet group of companies for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>OPTING OUT</p>
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.</p>
<p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of registering a domain name in a registry that we administer.</p>
<p>IP ADDRESSES AND COOKIES</p>
<p>We use cookies (small files placed on your computer) in order to improve the performance of our websites, the services we offer, and provide tailored advertising. In particular we use Google’s analytics products and features including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remarketing</li>
<li>Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
<li>Demographics and Interest Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>We also use cookies from the following services to track the analytics of our websites and provide tailored advertising:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>HotJar</li>
<li>HubSpot</li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect information about your computer, such as IP address, operating system and browser type, and we may also track which pages on our website you visit and how long you spend on each page.</p>
<p>You can find more information about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nominet.uk/resources/how-we-use-cookies/">how we use cookies</a>, including information about how to control what cookies are set including opt out when you visit our <a href="https://www.nominet.uk/resources/how-we-use-cookies/">cookies policy</a>.</p>
<p>ANALYSING .UK DOMAIN NAME USAGE</p>
<p>So we can monitor usage of .uk domains, Nominet collects data, on a regular basis, on whether .uk domain names resolve, where they are hosted, whether they are used for email and whether a website is in place. As part of this, we collect information about the landing page and About Us or Contact Us pages of your website so that we can categorise the website type (e.g. blog, parking page etc). We may also check whether you have an SSL certificate and whether there is a matching domain name in a different top level domain (e.g. .com), and collect similar information about them in order to see how they differ from the .uk domain name. We also collect information on which content management systems (CMS) websites are using along with version numbers in an attempt to identify security vulnerabilities. The information we gather is used to help Nominet better understand the .uk market,&nbsp;identify security vulnerabilities and identify changes over time. To keep bandwidth to a minimum, we will restrict the number of times we visit websites which use the same IP address. Any information gathered is used to help Nominet better understand how .uk domains are used by registrants.</p>
<p>If you want to, you can stop us from collecting data about your website(s) by adding the following to a “robots.txt” file:</p>
<p>User-agent: http://www.nominet.org.uk/privacypolicy<br>
Disallow: /</p>
<p>You can find more information about “robots.txt” files&nbsp;<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>CHANGE OF PURPOSE</p>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please <a href="#co_anchor_a599551_1">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</li>
</ol>
<p>We may disclose your personal data in accordance with our <a href="https://www.nominet.uk/resources/privacy-notice/releasing-your-personal-data-to-third-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data release policy.</a></p>
<p>In order to fulfil the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above, we may share your personal data with internal and external third parties. We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p>In addition, we will share your personal data where we are under a legal obligation to do so.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</li>
</ol>
<p>We may transfer and store personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the processing or fulfilment of applications, and the provision of support services. We will take all steps necessary to ensure that personal data is handled lawfully and securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>DATA SECURITY</li>
</ol>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>DATA RETENTION</li>
</ol>
<p>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</li>
</ol>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>
<p>NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
