                <p class="privacy-policy-content mbl">
                    We will collect information which will help us to verify your identity, such as email addresses, usernames and passwords,
                    along with other personal information we will need in order to provide you with a copy of your credit file. This will include,
                    for example, your name, date of birth, your residential address and postcode. This information will be checked against external
                    databases, such as the electoral roll and your credit file, to which we have access for this purpose. We will collect and
                    store a record of the check as well as any additional information you provide, including (but not limited to) aliases, previous
                    addresses and financial associations. This information may be disclosed to authorised third parties through our credit referencing,

                    Occasionally we may ask you to provide documentation for the purpose of verifying your identity, such as utility bills or

                    the privacy of such personal information. We store such documentation securely, and it will be destroyed once verification
                    is complete.

                    may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when: checking details on applications
                    for credit and credit-related or other facilities; managing credit and credit-related accounts or facilities; recovering

                    from the ranked list of offers, then the third party credit provider will proceed to carry out its own identification and
