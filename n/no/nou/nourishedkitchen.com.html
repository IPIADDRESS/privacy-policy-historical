⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you're lucky, you can find their little yellow caps peeking above the forest floor in the fall. Or, if you might find them at your farmers market or tucked in boxes at a local gourmet shop.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Mushrooms aren't quite plants, and they're certainly not animal.  Rather, they're eukaryotes  like yeast.  And, like yeast, they can be potent sources of B vitamins.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Mushrooms, in general, are immunomodulants.  That is, they may help to regulate and normalize the immune system.  And chanterelles in particular have neuroprotective effects. 💛⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Chanterelles have a mildly floral aroma with notes of citrus. I like to dice and sauté them with olive oil and shallots, and then fold them into butter.  Or simmer them in cream to serve over chicken or fish.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
What would you do with these beauties?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Of course you do. 💛⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Every morning, my toddler wakes up starving. That means I’ve got about 20 minutes (or less) to get food on the table before he completely loses his cool⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Most mornings it’s pan-scrambled eggs, avocado and sourdough toast. And, as you can imagine, that gets boring pretty quickly.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So, the other day I made this super simple Coconut Rice Breakfast Pudding instead. And it’s magical - creamy, sweetened with the lightest swirl of maple syrup, perfumed by cardamom and topped with plenty of seasonal fruit. Berries and plums work well in summer, but roasted pears would be dreamy for autumn.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My grandmother made rice pudding - but it would take HOURS. This one? Less than 20 minutes. I promise.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You start by warming coconut milk and maple syrup together with salt and cardamom, then toss in some of @lundbergfarms ready-to-heat Organic Coconut Rice. [ad] Simmer, and then toss in some fruit.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
EASY!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Now, I’m usually a harcdore DIYer, but from time-to-time it’s really nice to have something fast and wholesome that you can pull out in a pinch. Plus they’re a 4th generation producer that uses organic and eco-positive farming methods. 💚⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Here’s what you need:⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1 can light coconut milk⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1/4 cup maple syrup⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1 package Lundberg ready-to-heat Organic Coconut Rice⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Fruit and Nuts or Seeds⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Warm the coconut milk, maple, salt and cardamom together over medium heat. Then break up the rice, open the package, dump it in and stir about 10 minutes. Let it stand about 5 minutes to cool, and then top with fruit, nuts or seeds.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
P.S. The ingredients in the coconut rice are SUPER simple.  If you're curious, check out the link in my profile. ❤️⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

There's this magical and inextricable connection between the animals, the land they graze, and people. 💚⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And what's particularly beautiful is that, when we move with intention and thought for the whole, one nourishes the other.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Meet Cloe. 💛⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I've known her since she was a little girl, and she brought her first motherless lamb to our farmers market years ago.  She wrapped a blue ribbon arounds its neck, and sat bottle-feeding the lamb each week until it was strong enough to stay on the pasture.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
She's a teen now.  And what's more, a regenerative rancher. But she doesn't just tend lambs. Instead, she practices planned holistic management - a regenerative agricultural system that holds powerful promise in the fight against climate change.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
She also produces amazing, grass-fed lamb that's fed on green pasture and rangeland.  Lamb is rich in protein, healthy fats, B vitamins and key minerals like zinc which supports immunity and reproductive health. 💚⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And we're GIVING AWAY $250 of her grass-fed lamb! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
While we're firmly in the EAT YOUR MEAT camp, we also eat a ton of pulses. Partly because they're mercifully inexpensive, partly because they're really nutritious, but mostly because they're so, so delicious.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I first stumbled across this beautiful blend of slow-cooked onions and vibrant tomatoes with oregano in the Agva me Domates recipe by @ful.filled.  But, I'm sensitive to eggwhites, so dropping eggs to simmer away in that gorgeous tomato sauce wouldn't work - and it quickly inspired a simple chickpea stew.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Pulses like chickpeas need other flavor-forward foods for balance. Their earthiness depends upon salty cheeses and cured meats, robust sweet-tart tomatoes or vibrant green herbs.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This stew is really easy to make.  You'll need:⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Extra virgin olive oil⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Onions⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Garlic⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Some dried herbs and spices⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Diced tomatoes and Cherry Tomatoes⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Chickpeas⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Chicken Bone Broth⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Feta⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Plenty of herbs and a squeeze of lemon⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You can make this recipe with dry chickpeas. But, if you're in a pinch, you can grab a jar of @jovial's chickpeas.  They're *soaked* overnight, cooked and packed in glass jars to minimize exposure to BPA and plasticizers that you often find in metal cans.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I first stumbled across this beautiful blend of slow-cooked onions and vibrant tomatoes with oregano in the Agva me Domates recipe by @ful.filled.  But, I'm sensitive to eggwhites, so dropping eggs to simmer away in that gorgeous tomato sauce wouldn't work - and it quickly inspired a simple chickpea stew.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Natural, real foods are so wonderfully vibrant.  There's a life force behind them.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This gorgeous drink is beet kvass.  Kvass is a naturally fermented probiotic drink from Eastern Europe, and there's so many varieties! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Here's the beautiful thing: Unlike most fermented drinks which retain a fairly high sugar content even post fermentation, kvass doesn't need added sugars to ferment properly. That's because the natural carbohydrates in beets are sufficient to support fermentation, and it tends to be dryer and definitely less sweet than ferments like water kefir, jun, kombucha, or homemade soda.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So, for people who need support with blood sugar balance, kvass is a really good option.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Beets are also naturally high in nitrates, and when you consume them, your body converts them to nitric acid which  increases blood flow and supports oxygenation.  So it's an awesome choice for people who need cardiovascular support, and a particularly good choice for athletes.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And it's super easy to make, too. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You'll need:⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Beets (duh!) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Water⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Sea salt⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- A starter culture like a bit of kombucha, whey, sauerkraut juice etc.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Whatever extras you like (ginger is awesome!)⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
That's it! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Now there's a bit of controversy surrounding the use of starter cultures with beet kvass. Traditionally, kvass is made with a starter culture and while your kvass will ferment fine in its absence, you may need extra salt. So, you often get better palatability and faster results.  But YOU DO YOU!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
