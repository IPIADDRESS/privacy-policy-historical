When you download the products we require you to fill out a form with your name and email address.</p><p>Nox may also collect personal information about individuals indirectly from third parties, such as from our business partners, from third party providers of marketing lists, and through various other methods, including:</p><ul><li>Cookies</li><li>Referrers</li><li>IP addresses</li><li>System information</li></ul><p>None of these methods can be used to identify, or reasonably identify, you with the exception of cookies, which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our Web Sites.</p><h2>How and why is your information used?</h2><p>You have complete control over your personal information. In general, you can visit our website without providing us with any personal information. However, there are instances where we must have your personal information in order for us to grant you access to our protected and secured sites. This information may include registration data (your name, address, email address, phone number, title, etc.), information request data and response data ("User Information"). When you receive your confirmation email or when you receive any email from the list server, you will be given instructions on how to remove yourself from the list.</p><h3>Use of User Information</h3><p>We intend to use such information for purposes of supporting your relationship with Nox by designing content that is suitable to your needs and alerting you to new product and service offerings as they become available. This User Information may be retained by Nox to verify compliance with the agreement between Nox and your employer, to keep track of the domains from which people visit us, to create a user profile to better serve you, or to simply contact you either electronically or otherwise.

You can still access most of the features on our website even without accepting a cookie.</p><h3>Links to other websites</h3><p>Nox’s website provides links to other third party websites.

The length of time we retain your personal information for is determined by operational and legal considerations. For example, we are legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory and regulatory obligations .<br>We review our retention periods on a regular basis.</p><h2>Your Rights</h2><p>We provides you with the ability to exercise certain choices and controls in connection with our treatment of your information.
