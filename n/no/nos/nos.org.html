<p class="MsoNormal"><b>INFORMATION COLLECTION &amp; USE</b><br>
NIOS is the sole owner of the Personal Information collected through our Web
Sites or in connection with the Services. <br>
<br>
<u>Data Collected from non-Registered Users</u> <br>
<br>
You may visit the Web Sites without providing any Personal Information. <br>
<br>
<u>Data Collected from Registered Users</u> <br>
<br>
We need to collect Personal Information such as name, phone number, email
address, state, and country in order for you to register for Services or to
respond to your requests for information that you may submit to us through the
Web Site. We use this information to process your requests, to administer the
Services in which you have expressed interest, and to provide information to
you relating to our Services. You may have the option to provide additional
demographic information (such as job title, corporation affiliation, geographic
location, or other data) through the Web Sites. We use this information to
analyze interest in the Web Site and to improve the information we make
available through the Web Sites. <br>
<br>
<u><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Data Collected through Referrals </u><br>
<br>
We provide a mechanism for you to refer other persons whom you believe may be
interested in our Services. In such cases, we will send the referral a one-time
email inviting him or her to visit our Web Site. We maintain this information
for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the
success of our referral program, but will not send further unsolicited
communications. <br>
<br>
We engage third party services such as TechTarget and KnowledgeStorm to
identify potential users of our Services. These services employ their own
mechanisms to enable individuals to opt out of email distribution lists. <br>
<br>
<u>External Links </u><br>
<br>
Our Web Site may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled
by NIOS t. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy
practices of such other sites that you may access from our Web Site. We
encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy
statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable
information. <br>
<br>
<u>Automated Web Site Tracking </u><br>
<br>
When you visit one of our Web Sites, statistics about your visit are
automatically collected. This information does not identify you personally, but
rather identifies information about a visit to the Web Site. This information
may include how many people visit the Web Site, the user's Internet Protocol
(IP) address, which pages are visited, from which domains our visitors come and
which types of browsers these persons use. We use these statistics about your
visit for aggregate, analytical purposes only, to help us improve the
performance and effectiveness of our Web Site. <br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><br>
<u>Cookies</u> <br>
<br>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for
record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on our Web Sites. We do/do not link the
information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit through
our Web Sites. We use both session cookies and permanent cookies. A session
cookie expires when you close you browser. A permanent cookie remains on your
hard drive for an extended period of time. You may decline to accept cookies or
may remove permanent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet
browser's "help" file. <br>
<br>
We use temporary cookies to help your browser navigate our Web Site, to determine
which visitors reach our Web Site from sites of our business partners, and to
record during a user's session that the user is properly authenticated. We use
permanent cookies to recall your information to save you time in filling out
forms and/or revisiting our Web Site and to determine which visitors to our Web
Sites have visited them before and if so, for what purposes. <br>
<br>
If you reject cookies, you may still generally access the informational
material on our Web Sites, but you may be unable to obtain some of our Services
or access some portions of our Web Sites. <br>
<br>
<u>Certificate Application Information</u> <br>
<br>
In order to issue digital certificates and provide our Services, we must
collect and maintain Personal Information about prospective Certificate Holders.

certificates or provide Services. We require documentation establishing that
certificate applicants have expressly consented to the use of their Personal
Information in connection with our Services. <br>
<br>
<u>Subscriber Information </u><br>
<br>
We must also collect Personal Information from officers and other
representatives of companies that subscribe to our Services and designate

<br>
<b>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Aggregate Information</u> <br>

</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Certificate Information</u> <br>
<br>
All information that you provide us that forms the content of a certificate

No person should have any expectation of privacy in the contents of a

<br>
<u>International Data Transfer</u> <br>
<br>
We maintain and process Personal Information in the United States. Accordingly,
information obtained elsewhere will be transferred to, maintained in, and

of our Services, you must consent to such transfer and processing of your
information in the United States. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>SECURITY</b> <br>
<br>
We consider the protection of all personal information we receive from our Web
Site visitors, Subscribers, Relying Parties, and Certificate Holders as a core
responsibility. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss,
misuse, and alteration of Personal Information. As with any transmission over
the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved in sending
personal information. In order to try to minimize this risk, we encrypt
information that you submit to us electronically when submitting requests or
ordering certificates. <br>
<br>
We implement data security safeguards based upon generally accepted industry
standards to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, alteration, or loss. Nonetheless, no data security techniques are
100% effective, and we cannot guarantee its security. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</b> <br>
<br>
If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy
Policy on our Web Site. We may change this Privacy Policy at any time without
prior notice. If we make material revisions to this Policy that change the ways
in which we use or disclose previously collected Personal Information, we will
post a notice on our Web Site and, if appropriate, by email.</p>
