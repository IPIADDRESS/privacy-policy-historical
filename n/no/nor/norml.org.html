        <p> NORML understands your concerns about your privacy, both on and off 
          the Internet. We have provided this privacy statement so that you will 
          know what information NORML gathers, how we use that information, and 
          what you can do to correct it if necessary.

          The value in identifying your state to NORML and the NORML Foundation
