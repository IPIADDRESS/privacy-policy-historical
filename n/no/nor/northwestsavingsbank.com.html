       Northwest Savings Bank does not knowingly solicit data from children and we do not knowingly market to children. We recognize that protecting children’s identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with the Internet industry and with parents.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Internet is a public network. Children’s access to the Internet can allow them to visit inappropriate websites and be exposed to unwanted risks. COPPA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, protects children under the age of 13 from the online collect of personal information. For more information about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act visit the FTC website at <a target="_self" href="http://www.northwestsavingsbank.com/notice.htm?http:www.ftc.gov/">http://www.ftc.gov/ .</a>

       DO NOT CALL POLICY</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Northwest Savings Bank (NSB) complies with the law and regulations and is committed to protecting and respecting consumers' rights to privacy.
      </li>
      <li>
        NSB maintains a record of the name and telephone number(s) (both customers and non-customers) will be added to the NSB Internal Do Not Call List within five (5) business days of receipt of such request.&nbsp; This record will be retained for at least five (5) years.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consumers are responsible for notifying NSB of any changes in name or telephone number if they move or wish to place a new telephone number on the NSB Internal Do Not Call List.&nbsp; Consumers are responsible for notifying NSB if there is more than one telephone line or number that they wish to place on the NSB Internal Do Not Call List.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consumers have additional avenues to them which will help reduce or eliminate unwanted telephone solicitations.&nbsp; Consumers may place their telephone number(s) on the National Do Not Call Registry by calling 1-888-382-1222 or online at <a target="_self" href="http://www.northwestsavingsbank.com/notice.htm?http://www.donotcall.gov/">http://www.donotcall.gov/</a>.&nbsp; The Direct marketing Association also offers a free service called "Telephone Preference Service".&nbsp; Consumers may register for this service online at <a target="_self" href="http://www.northwestsavingsbank.com/notice.htm?http://www.dmaconsumers.org/">http://www.dmaconsumers.org/</a> or by sending a written request to:

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As a general rule, NSB does not currently engage in telemarketing activities.&nbsp; However, NSB has established and implemented written procedures to honor consumers' requests that they not be solicited, and appropriate personnel have received training.&nbsp; Procedures include consultation of both the National Do Not Call Registry and the NSB Internal Do Not Call List prior to making any telephone solicitation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Telephone solicitation calls to consumers with whom NSB has an established business relationship are permitted unless they have asked to be included on the NSB Internal Do Not Call List.&nbsp; Calling customers regarding their existing accounts with NSB does not constitute a telephone solicitation call.
      </li>
      <li>
        No unsolicited facsimile solicitations will be initiated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consumers may request a copy of the Policy.&nbsp; Upon receipt of request, we will send a copy via U.S. mail within a reasonable time period of thirty (30) days.
      </li>
