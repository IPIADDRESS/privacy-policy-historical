<p dir="ltr">Privacy Policy</p></font></b>
<p dir="ltr">NoRedInk, LLC. ("NoRedInk," "we," "us," "our"), knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting NoRedInk's website at www.noredink.com or any of NoRedInk's other websites, applications, domain names or other linked pages, (collectively the "Website"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. By using the Website, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You post any Content (as that term is defined in NoRedInk's <a href="http://noredink.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>) on the Website at your own risk. Although we may allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Content you post on the Website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Content. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any improper collection or misuse of Content or other information accessible on the Website is a violation of NoRedInk's Terms of Service and should be reported to <a href="mailto:info@noredink.com">info@noredink.com</a>.
</p><p dir="ltr">WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</p>
<p dir="ltr">This Privacy Policy explains how NoRedInk collects and uses information from its users who access the Website and use our services, including NoRedInk's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). Also, this Privacy Policy covers NoRedInk's treatment of any Personal Information that NoRedInk's business partners share with NoRedInk, or that you provide to NoRedInk through a third party website. <b>This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that NoRedInk does not own or control, or to individuals that NoRedInk does not employ or manage, including providers of third party software that may be offered on NoRedInk's Website ("Third Party Software").</b></p><b><font size="5">
<p dir="ltr">HOW IS CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION TREATED?</p></font></b>
<p dir="ltr">If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may only use this service and disclose Personal Information with your parent or guardian's express consent. NoRedInk collects limited Personal Information from students ("Children's Personal Information"), but only where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has contracted with NoRedInk to collect Children's Personal Information from students for the use and benefit of the learning environment. NoRedInk requires schools, districts, and/or teachers to obtain parental consent from students' parents before collecting any such Children's Personal Information. If you are a student, please do not send any Children's Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Children's Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student has provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for the Website, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student may have provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Website, or that a student's school, district, or teacher has not obtained parental consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@noredink.com">info@noredink.com</a>.
</p><p dir="ltr">Hereinafter, references to "Personal Information" shall apply to personal information of individual Website users who are not student registrants. References to "Children's Personal Information" shall only apply to personal information of student users of the Website. General references to "information" shall apply to all users.</p><b><font size="5">
<p dir="ltr">WHAT INFORMATION DOES NOREDINK DISPLAY OR COLLECT?</p></font></b>
<p dir="ltr">When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile and interests, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels, depending on the category of user ("User Category") you are, and as permitted by the functionality of the Website. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services. In most cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your connections list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. In addition to the foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.</p><b><font size="4">
<p dir="ltr">Information You Provide to Us:</p></font></b>
<p dir="ltr">We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Website, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way. This information may include, without limitation, Personal Information such as your name, email address, and your school affiliation, Children's Personal Information (which shall be limited to your name, and the contact information necessary to receive notifications via the Website from your teacher, school, and/or district ("Notifications")), billing and payment information, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. The Children's Personal Information you provide shall only be used for creating your individual account (which will identify you within the user group(s) for which you have been granted an access code ("Limited-access User Group")), and for sending you Notifications. You may modify or remove your Personal Information or Children's Personal Information identified below at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and/or account information.</p><b><font size="4">
<p dir="ltr">Information Collected Automatically:</p></font></b>
<p dir="ltr">We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or our services. NoRedInk automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, NoRedInk cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Website. This information is not Personal Information or Children's Personal Information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components. NoRedInk only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our partners' services and the Website to help provide you with an optimal online experience.</p><b>
</b><p dir="ltr"><b>Email Communications:</b> </p>
<p dir="ltr">If you provide us your email address, we may send you email communications. If you are a student, we will only use your email address to send you Notifications. If you are not a student, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from NoRedInk if your computer supports this type of program. NoRedInk uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our non-student user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.</p><b><font size="5">
<p dir="ltr">WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?</p></font></b>
<p dir="ltr">Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. NoRedInk cookies do not collect Personal Information or Children's Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information or Children's Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Website's most attractive features without cookies enabled.</p><b><font size="5">
<p dir="ltr">WILL NOREDINK SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</p></font></b>
<p dir="ltr">Personal Information and Children's Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information or Children's Personal Information to anyone. However, we share your Personal Information and Children's Personal Information in personally identifiable form as described below. Again, please note that references to "Personal Information" only apply to personal information of individuals who are not students.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Businesses We Do Not Control: In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we're affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us), including Third Party Software. We may, for example, sell products or provide services jointly with other businesses, or work with third party websites to enhance your online experience. These transactions or services may or may not be commercial in nature. You can recognize when such a business is associated with such a transaction or service. We will share your Personal Information or Children's Personal Information with that business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. Such services may include the ability for you to automatically transmit information you input on the Website to your profile or account on a third party website, or to automatically transmit information you input on a third party website to your Website profile.

Moreover, if NoRedInk, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that NoRedInk goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of NoRedInk may continue to use your Personal Information and Children's Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Protection of NoRedInk and Others: We may release Personal Information or Children's Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of NoRedInk, our employees, our users, or others.
