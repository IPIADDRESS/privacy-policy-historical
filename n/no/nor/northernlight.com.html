<img src="/gif/blt_blue.gif" width="400" height="1" border="0" vspace="2"><br>
<span class="default">
This Site enables users to search divine's Special Collection, a large 
collection of premium materials including books, magazines, databases, and newswires 
not available from any other search engine.  The Site and our search services may be 
used by any user, but Special Collection materials generally are made available for 
a fee on a per document basis or as part of paid subscription.<br><br><br>

<img src="/gif/blt_blue.gif" width="400" height="1" border="0" vspace="2"><br>
<span class="default">
<font color="#0033cc"><b>PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</b></font><br>
Personally identifying information is generally available to us only if you supply 
it voluntarily through our Web site or in connection with a purchase.  For instance, 
in setting up your Member Account or a Promotional Account, we collect certain types 
of personal information such as your name, credit card number for Member Accounts, 
and e-mail address.  For our corporate or Enterprise Accounts, we collect information 
such as name, phone number, fax number, company address, industry type, and number of 
potential users, related to the particular authorized user for billing and reporting 
purposes for the corporate account holder.  Other information that identifies you 
personally may be collected by us through comments or suggestions submitted through 
our site.  We do not collect any additional information from third parties.<br><br>

You are required to establish an account in order to fully access and purchase Special 
Collection materials or other pay-per-view content.  Any personal information that you 
share with Northern Light速 will be used for limited internal purposes, including 
processing your transactions, customer service, marketing, development, content 
processing, content classification and providing you with information regarding our 
services, and our monthly newsletter.  Please note that if you do not wish to receive 
our monthly newsletter, you can <a href="#optout">opt out</a>.  With Member or 
Promotional Accounts, we do not share your name, e-mail address, credit card numbers, 
mailing address, purchasing history or any other personal identifying information that 
is collected from this Site with any third parties, except as necessary to process your 
transactions.  However, you should be aware that for certain co-branded sites, some 
information may be shared with a <a href="#allies">Strategic Ally</a> as further 
described below.  For Enterprise Accounts, personal information such as the user name 
or identification and purchasing history may be shared with the Enterprise Account holder.
<br><br>

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, 
or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with 
legal process, respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our 
company, our employees, customers, or the public.<br><br>

<font color="#0033cc"><b>E-MAIL ADDRESSES</b></font><br>
We collect e-mail addresses as part of providing services.  We may send you e-mails from 
time-to-time for customer service or our own marketing purposes.  In limited circumstances, 
your e-mail address may be shared with our Strategic Allies, where Northern Light's 
technology is used to power the searches for the Web site of another company, as described 
further below.  Except as is described in this policy, we will not disclose your email 
address to any third party without your consent.  If you do not want us or one of the 
Strategic Allies listed below to contact you about any promotional opportunities you can 
let us know by <a href="#optout">opting out</a>.<br><br>

<font color="#0033cc"><b>INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</b></font><br>
We do not intend, and this site is not designed, to collect personal information from 
children under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13, you should not provide 
information on this Site, and should ask a parent to do so for you.  Member and 
Enterprise Accounts are only available for individuals that are 18 years old or older.
<br><br>

<font color="#0033cc"><b>AGGREGATE AND "CLICK STREAM" INFORMATION</b></font><br>
We collect aggregate information about you and your use of our services, whether you 
have an account or not.  For instance, we may collect various forms of click stream 
information such as IP address information, entry and exit points for our Site (i.e., 
referring URLs or domains), search terms, site traffic, page views, impressions, and 
operating system and browser type.  Such aggregate information generally will not 
personally identify you or be correlated to you.  If we do correlate any aggregate 
information to you specifically, we will do so for our internal use only and will not 
disclose such information to any third party.  We may collect, compile, store, publish, 
promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all aggregate information, 
provided that, such information does not personally identify you.<br><br>

<font color="#0033cc"><b>COOKIES</b></font><br>
We may make use of "cookies" on our Site or those of our Strategic Allies.  Cookies are 
small text files that are stored on a user's computer by the Web server through a user's 
browser.  A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from your 
computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the 
Web site that originally placed it on your hard drive.  The actual contents of the cookie 
information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently 
to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of the site based on information stored in the 
cookie or host server.  Therefore, cookies allow us to automate access and data entry 
functions of our Site such as login information, correlate online ordering information for 
purchases you may make while at the Site (if any), tailor the Site to your preferences or 
interests, or customize promotions or marketing.  In addition, cookies allow us to track 
usage of the Site to determine those areas of the Site which are useful or popular and those 
that are not thereby enabling us to improve and update the Site effectively.  <br><br>

You may adjust your Web browsers to either alert you of the use of cookies or refuse to 
accept cookies entirely.  For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can click on the "Start" 
button and then select Control Panel, Internet Options and the Security tab.  If you click 
on the "Custom" button, you will be able to see the cookie options.  For Netscape users, 
in the browser, select File, Preferences and then Advanced to view the cookie options.  
Be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of the Site may not function 
properly or permit access.<br><br>

<span class="default">
We have entered into a variety of strategic relationships with other organizations, such as 
those listed on our <a href="/enterprise/clients.html">Allies Page</a>, often to provide 
Northern Light's search and content technology.  As part of our service, we may provide 
aggregate information for accounting purposes to our Strategic Allies.  In addition, we may 
be required in limited circumstances to share some personal information with a Strategic Ally 
for certain custom sites or other specialty service offerings.  Such sites and services 
typically are maintained under a different or sub-level domain name (e.g., usgovsearch.com 
or usgovsearch.northernlight.com).  For such specialty sites or services, we will notify you 
as to whether personal information is shared with our Strategic Ally in a separate privacy 
policy on that specialty site or service.  Therefore, whenever you access a new domain or 
sub-domain name or see a specialty site or service containing the Northern Light速 name or 
logo and that of a third party, you should refer to the privacy policy for that site since 
its terms may vary from this policy.<br><br>

In no event will we share any credit card or similar financial information that we collect from 
our Site with our Strategic Allies.  Any personal information that is shared with a Strategic 
Ally is considered confidential information to be held in confidence by us and the Strategic 
Ally, and will not be sold, used or otherwise disclosed to a third party.<br><br>
