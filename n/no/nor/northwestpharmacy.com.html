        <h2>The Types of Personal Information We Collect 
        </h2>
        <p>
            To order from this website, we request certain personally identifiable information
                                                from you on the registration form. During registration and account creation, you
                                                are required to provide your contact information (such as name, address, phone number
                                                and email address) and you are also required to create a password. We use this information
                                                to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have created an account, you are then able to order prescription drugs
                                                as well as over the counter drugs. For orders for over the counter drugs, we request
                                                no additional information other than that which has been provided during the registration
                                                and account creation process as mentioned above. To order prescription medications,
                                                we will require additional medical information about the patient (which may be you
                                                or a family member) for whom the prescription has been ordered. This information
                                                includes: height, weight, date of birth, gender, the existence and types of drug
                                                allergies, medications requested, medical history information, details of your existing
                                                medications, prescription information and the name of your primary physician and
                                                his or her contact information. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The choice to provide us with personal information is always yours. However, your
                                                decision to withhold particular details may limit the products and services we are
                                                able to provide and makes it more difficult for us to advise you or suggest appropriate
                                                alternatives. If we are unable to accommodate your request based on the information
                                                that has been provided, we may ask for additional details in order to serve you
                                                best. We may also maintain a file containing contact history that is used for customer
                                                inquiry purposes. We may collect anonymous/non-personal information. Anonymous/non-personal
                                                information is information that cannot be associated with or traced back to a specific
                                                individual or business entity.

                                                provide the products and services you have requested. We may provide your or your
                                                family members personal information to a Canadian or other physician to review and
                                                approve your prescription. We may use personal information to send you notices and
                                                special offers via email. You may opt out of these emails at any time by clicking

        <p>
            We will not furnish personal information to an outside organization for its use

        </p>
        <p>
            We use personal information only for the purposes that we have disclosed to you.
                                                If for any reason your information is required to further a different purpose, we
                                                will notify you and ask you for your consent before we proceed. Only the information
                                                specifically requested is disclosed and we will take precautions to satisfy ourselves
                                                that the authorities who make the request have legitimate grounds to do so. We may
                                                disclose personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure
                                                is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding,

                                                collect on a delinquent account. We sometimes contract outside organizations to
                                                perform specialized services. Our trusted service suppliers may at times be responsible

        </h2>
        <p>
            We use current technologies and maintain security standards to ensure that your
                                                personal information is protected against unauthorized access, disclosure, inappropriate
                                                alteration or misuse. All safety and security measures are also appropriate to the
                                                sensitivity level of your information. Electronic client files are kept in a secure

                                                reviewed periodically and we employ current technologies to assist us in protecting
                                                the confidentiality and privacy of your information. In the course of daily operations,
                                                we attempt to restrict access to personal information to authorized employees who
                                                have a legitimate business purpose and reason for accessing it. As a condition of

                                                the privacy standards we have established and to follow all applicable laws and
                                                regulations. Unauthorized access to and/or disclosure of client information by an
                                                employee of NorthWestPharmacy.com is strictly prohibited. All employees are expected
                                                to maintain the confidentiality of personal information at all times and failing
                                                to do so will result in appropriate disciplinary measures, which may include dismissal.

                We understand how difficult and frustrating it can be if a member of your family is in desperate need of a specific medication but it is not available from a certain country.  NorthWestPharmacy.com is here to help and we are pleased to announce that we can now accept international prescriptions and ship products internationally as well.  A prescription written by a Non-U.S. physician can be provided by fax, email or mail.  Any international prescription that is provided is subject to review and approval by our pharmacist before any order can be processed and shipped.  A customer may be required to complete additional forms before an order can be placed and sent to the desired destination country.  For answers to some common questions please visit our FAQ section or email our International Department at <a href="mailto:intl@northwestpharmacy.com">Intl@NorthWestPharmacy.com</a>
                <br>
