<p>We are committed to protecting Your Information and providing You with a safe, efficient and customised experience. To this effect, We have created this Privacy Policy to let You know what Information We collect when You use the Services, why We collect this Information and how We use the collected Information. The defined terms used in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as specified in the Terms of Service.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Last updated: 1 July 2014</p>
<h3>1. ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY (the “Privacy Policy” or the “Policy”)</h3>
<p>1.1. This Policy represents an agreement between you (“<b>You</b>” or “<b>Your</b>”) and Nordeus Limited, 53 Merrion Square, Dublin 2, Ireland (“<b>Nordeus</b>”, “<b>We</b>”, “<b>Us</b>” or “<b>Our</b>”). This Policy sets out the ways that We use the personal information which we may gather in providing you with games, software, updates, add-ons (including virtual goods and virtual currency) and services that are offered to you by us as well as any Nordeus website which you access to avail of any of the above (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”). </p>
<p>1.2. References to Nordeus in these Terms shall include any Nordeus affiliates which shall include subsidiaries, parent companies and any other entities under common ownership. Where you receive or participate in a Service provided directly by Nordeus, Nordeus is the data controller of your personal data.</p>
<p>1.3. Our Services may be accessed through one or more third party websites, services or platforms (such as Facebook or the App Store). In addition, payments are processed through third party payment processors (for example, through a third party service or platform which you are using to access the Services, such as Facebook). Our Services may also contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your Information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.</p>
<h3>2. AGREEING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time and You shall be notified of any such amendment via the platform through which You access the Services and/or by Us publishing the modified Privacy Policy on any platform through which You access the Services. We recommend that You revisit this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. For the avoidance of doubt, Your continued use of the Services shall be interpreted as deemed acceptance of any modifications to the Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>3.7. Should You purchase a licence to use Virtual Items through a third party platform, and that purchase is processed by or on behalf of a third party (e.g. Apple Inc. where You have made a purchase on an iOS device), We may receive payment information which You provide to that third party but only in order to allow us to provide you with the licence to use Virtual Items. Any purchases which You make through a third party in this manner may be subject to their policies and it is Your sole responsibility to ensure Your compliance with those policies. We do not collect, nor do we have access to any of your billing or credit information.

<p>4.6. We may disclose Your Information, and the contents of all Your online communications, if required to do so by law, or if We believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable laws or regulations or any legal process served on Us, the Services or in circumstances where We are under a substantially similar legal obligation; (ii) protect and defend Our rights or property; (iii) act to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public; or (iv) if, in Our sole determination, You are found to have cheated or attempted to defraud Us or any other user of the Services in any way, or if We suspect You of any fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>4.7. We may further provide Your Information to any third parties and data processors providing services to Us, including but not limited to, payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, customer service, hosting and marketing services, and by helping us to administer and provide the Services.

<p>4.12. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Privacy Policy shall prevent Us from retaining Your Information where We are required to do so by law. If You have sent or posted content on the Service, We may not be able to delete it.</p>
<h3>5. COOKIES AND AUTOMATED INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>
<p>5.1. By accessing or using the Services You authorise Us to collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyse usage of the Services; (ii) provide a more personalised experience; and (iii) manage advertising. We, and our third party service providers, may use server log files or web log files and tracking technologies to collect and analyse certain types of technical information, including but not limited to, cookies, IP addresses, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, URLs, domain names, landing pages, game state, the date and time of usage of the Service, and other similar information.</p>
<p>5.2. We may also use other technologies, including but not limited to, web bugs, tracking pixels and cookies. Web bugs allow Us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an email was opened, while tracking pixels allow Us to advertise more efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to You on other websites. Cookies allow Us to improve the quality of the Services, make recommendations, and make the Services easier to use for You. A cookie is a small text file recorded on Your hard drive that identifies You as a unique user and contains certain information about Your particular login session and/or Your use of the Services. Please note that companies delivering advertisements within the Services may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.</p>
<p>5.3. We use Facebook’s Custom Audience feature to target users with advertising from time to time. Custom Audiences allow us to target ads to a specific set of people through Facebook. You can manage your privacy settings in the privacy tab of your Facebook account. </p>
<p>5.4. In the case the websites www.topeleven.com and www.nordeus.com:</p>
<p>(i) These sites uses Google Analytics including its Remarketing feature based on Display Advertising (www.google.com/analytics/) for online advertising and for website analytics purposes – meaning that We use them to see how many visitors come to Our Site, the pages that generate interest and the links that visitors most often click on (amongst other things). Google Analytics uses cookies – small text files that are placed on your computer that store certain limited information about you. The cookies we use do not enable any visitor to Our Site to be individually identified and will only be used for online advertising and website analytics purposes. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Preferences Manager.</p>
<p>(ii) In addition, the sites mentioned above use cookies, flash cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect information about you. This enables Us to tailor Our service offering (including Our Site) to provide you with products and services which are more relevant to your individual tastes. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to Our Site. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. You may change your website browser settings to reject cookies, although please note that if you do this it may impair the functionality of Our Site. For further information about cookies, including how to refuse cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

The Services provided by Nordeus (including the game Top Eleven) may only be used by a person over the age of 16 or a person between the age of 13 and 16 where that person’s parent or guardian has reviewed and consents to the Terms and this Policy on their behalf. Any person who provides Information to Nordeus through any part of the Services represents to Nordeus that they are 16 years of age or older or that they are between 13 years of age and 16 years of age and their parent or guardian has reviewed the Terms and this Policy and has consented on their behalf. </p>
<h3>7. SAFETY MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<p>7.1. We take reasonable measures to protect the Information that we collect from or about you (including your personally identifiable information) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>
<h3>8. DISCLAIMER</h3>
<p>8.1. You expressly agree that the Services are provided on an “as is” basis without warranties of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond Our direct control. Because of the complex and constantly changing nature of Our technology and business, We cannot guarantee, nor do We represent, that there will be an error-free performance regarding the privacy of Your Information, and We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to the use or release of Your Information.</p>
<h3>9. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h3>
<p>9.1. Your Information collected by Us may be stored and processed in any country in which We or Our affiliates, suppliers, ESPs or agents maintain facilities (see section 4.6). By using the Service, You expressly consent to any transfer of Information outside of Your country (including to third countries outside the EEA that may not have been assessed as having adequate privacy laws). </p>
<h3>10. MERGERS AND OTHER EVENTS REQUIRING TRANSFER</h3>
<p>10.1. If We should ever file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent, or be acquired by a third party, merge with a third party, sell all or part of Our assets, or transfer substantially all or part of Our relevant assets to a third party, We are entitled to share Your Information You have provided through the Services to potential and subsequent business and merger partners. By agreeing to the Terms of Service, You give Your consent to such transfer of this Information.</p>
<h3>11. YOUR RIGHTS</h3>

<h3>12. DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h3>
<p>If you are a California based user of the Services, please note that there is no consensus on how companies like ours should interpret “Do Not Track” signals in the context of recent amendments to the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We do not currently respond to Do Not Track signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device. You can learn more about Do Not Track here: http://www.allaboutdnt.com/.</p>
