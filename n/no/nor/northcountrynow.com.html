     <h3>NorthCountryNow.com Privacy Notice</h3><br>

      <p><b>Our Commitment To Privacy</b><br><br>Your privacy is important to us.
      To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online
      information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information
      is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available
      in the tool bar on the homepage and in the toolbar on every page where personally
      identifiable information may be requested.</p><br>

      <p><b>The Information We Collect:</b> <br><br>
      This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the
      NorthCountryNow.com website. On some pages, you can place a classified ad,
      make requests for advertising information and submit news items, photos,
      links and comment. The types of personal information collected at these pages
      may include:<br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Address<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email address<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone number<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit/Debit Card Information</p><br>

      <p><b>The Way We Use Information: </b><br><br>
      We use the information you provide about yourself when placing a classified
      ad only to complete that order and charge for the ad. We do not share this
      information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete
      that order.</p>

      <p>We use the information you provide when requesting advertising information
      or submitting news items, photos, links and comment only to confirm the
      identity of the submitter. We do not share this information with outside
      parties.</p>

      <p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our
      website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser
      that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that
      Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but
      we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>

      <p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information
      provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without
      also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such
      unrelated uses.</p><br>

      <p><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b><br><br>
      To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct
      use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic,
      and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect
      online. </p><br>
