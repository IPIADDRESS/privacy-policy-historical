For a customer, such information does not include that which is aggregated in such a manner that it cannot be connected to him/her and/or information which is publicly listed in a written or online directory or typically made available through directory assistance.<br><br>Use: <br>the treatment, handling and management of Personal Information by and within NowCrowd.<br><br><strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br><br>We only collect Personal Information that you consciously provide or that we otherwise receive in connection with our provision of the Services. Such information would typically include name, address (optional), E-mail, Smartphone number, push notification token taken from your device to enable push alerts to work, unique device ID (if different from push notification number), and encrypted data and visuals for cards, including Template Cards, that may be stored in your NowCrowd.<br>We may also collect Personal Information if you contact us, through e-mail, telephone conversations or the completion of forms, for support and other inquiries, or otherwise subscribe to or utilize ancillary Services to NowCrowd.<br>When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on your computer or Smartphone device. We send a "session cookie" to your computer or device when you log in to your account or browse our webpages. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't need to ask you for your password on each page, or to otherwise assist in associating one request with another in the same browser session. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.<br>We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't need to retype the e-mail address each time you log in to your account. We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.<br><br><strong>Accountability</strong><br>NowCrowd is responsible for Personal Information under its control and has designated its Privacy Officer as accountable for the company's compliance with the following principles.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; NowCrowd is responsible for Personal Information in its possession or custody.<br><br>2)&nbsp; In the event that we disclose your Personal Information to third parties or to a data storage or processing company with access to your Personal Information, as appropriate, NowCrowd commits to contractually bind such entities to abide by, or otherwise ensure that such entities will abide by, the fundamental terms of this policy and applicable laws, including with respect to their capability to use, disclose and retain such Personal Information.<br><br><br>3)&nbsp; NowCrowd shall implement policies and practices to give effect to:<br><br>a. Implementing procedures to protect Personal Information;<br><br>b. Establishing procedures to receive and respond to complaints and inquiries;<br><br>c.

When information is being collected for the detection and prevention of fraud or for law enforcement, seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information.<br><br>2)&nbsp; In obtaining consent, NowCrowd will use reasonable efforts to ensure that you are advised of the identified purposes for which Personal Information collected will be used or disclosed.<br><br>3)&nbsp; Your use of the Services in seeking to download and otherwise use and leverage NowCrowd will be considered consent to collect, use and disclose the associated Personal Information for all identified purposes described herein.

NowCrowd may inform the individual of the implications of such withdrawal.<br><br><strong>Use and Retention of Personal Information</strong><br><br>Personal Information will be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes listed herein or otherwise consented to.<br>1)&nbsp; Generally, all Personal Information collected by NowCrowd is to provide you with the Services (i.e., communicating between the NowCrowd application to be downloaded to or in your Smartphone and our centralized NowCrowd platform) as well as for such reasonably ancillary use in connection with such Services and your use and enjoyment of NowCrowd.

It is NowCrowd's practice to retain your account registration information after you have registered as well as encrypted card data and visuals so as to support you and provide future Services to you as you may direct from time to time.<br><br>4)&nbsp; Except as provided for in this policy, we will not sell, rent, lease, commercially exploit or otherwise disclose your Personal Information or data to third parties unless: (i) required by law or to cooperate with any bona fide legal investigation; (ii) required to protect the legal interests of NowCrowd, including in connection with a potential financing, merger or acquisition in which case the applicable counterparties shall be placed under obligations of confidentiality; or (iii) you provide consent to such disclosure where such consent may not reasonably be implied according to this Policy or otherwise. Please note that the laws on processing and otherwise concerning personal information may differ between countries, and as NowCrowd may hold and process Personal Information in Canada and the United States, the laws and standards in those two countries may diverge and possibly conflict.<br><br><strong>Accuracy</strong><br><br>At your request and notification, NowCrowd will update Personal Information as necessary to fulfill the identified purposes. You always have the right to request that we delete, destroy, return, amend or update your Personal Information in our possession as you may direct, subject to reasonable notice and your acceptance of the implications as to NowCrowd's ability to provide the Services to you.<br>Security<br>Personal Information will be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.<br><br>1)&nbsp; Any Personal Information in our possession is stored electronically, either on our server (which may be hosted offsite) or on other electronic storage media that may be retained as part of your files or otherwise.<br><br>2)&nbsp; We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, access to or alteration of your Personal Information and data under our control.<br><br>3)&nbsp; We operate computer networks that are protected by industry standard firewalls and password protection. Appropriate physical and managerial security is also in place, including but not limited to selected encryption as identified above and the execution by our employees and contractors of a confidentiality/non-disclosure agreement as a standard practice of our hiring, employment and contracting.<br><br>4)&nbsp; While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to your data will not occur, we will use our resources and expertise to attempt to prevent such occurrences.<br><br>5)&nbsp; We commit to providing a minimum of an annual review and training with respect to this policy among our staff with potential access to your Personal Information.<br><br><br><strong>Openness and Access</strong><br><br>NowCrowd will make readily available to you information about its policies and practices relating to the management of Personal Information. NowCrowd will make this Privacy Policy available to you prior to providing the Services.<br>You may access or inquire about your Personal Information in our possession at any time during our business hours.
