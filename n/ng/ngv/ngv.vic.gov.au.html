        <p><em>A cookie </em> is a packet of information sent by a server to a World Wide Web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses that server. Cookies are used on this Web site to remember visitors within a session to facilitate transaction functions. They are automatically deleted an hour after you leave this site. The following services on this site depend on cookies: </p>
        <blockquote>

        <h2>Detecting and preventing cookies </h2>
        <p>Many web surfers object to having files, like cookies, placed onto their hard drive without their permission. There are various things you can do to avoid cookies if you do not trust them, these include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Setting the browser cookie file to be Read Only. Whether you can do this or not may depend on what sort of Operating System (OS) or browser you are using. But if you can do this then the cookies will only last for as long as your browser is running. </li>
          <li>Setting up your computer to delete the cookies file whenever you start your browser. </li>
          <li>Many browsers allow you to set them up so that you are notified when a cookie is to be written to your computer. However there may be instances where there are so many cookies that it becomes annoying to reject them all. </li>
          <li>Installing a software product which will reject or manage cookies for you, these include Cookie Crusher, Cookie Pal and Cookie Cruncher. You can perform an internet search to find them. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disabling the cookies will impact on your ability to undertake the cookie related services listed above. </p>
        <p><em>Web beacons </em> are a means of determining who accessed a certain web page and when he or she did so. Web beacons are not used on this website and no third party collects information from this website. </p>
        <h2>Detecting and preventing Web beacons </h2>
 		<p>A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the site. <br>
  <br>
  Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking the user's activity. The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded. </p>
        <h2>Linking to Other Sites </h2>
        <p>This website privacy statement does not extend beyond the NGV website. When linking to other sites you should familiarise yourself with their website privacy statements. </p>
        <h2>How to contact the NGV to enquire about a website privacy issue </h2>
        <p>If you wish to enquire about the use of your personal information contact <a href="mailto:privacy@ngv.vic.gov.au">privacy@ngv.vic.gov.au</a></p>
        <h2>How to gain access to your personal information</h2>
        <p>The NGV will provide you with access to personal information acquired or presented about you on the NGV website for the purpose of verification and correction. Victoria's Information Privacy Act requires you to use the processes established by the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to access personal information. &nbsp; </p>
        <h2>Freedom of Information </h2>
        <p>Freedom of information requests should be made in writing, describing the documents requested. An application fee of $21 is required and other charges may apply to Freedom of Information requests. Charges other than the application fee may be waived if the request is a routine request or for access to a document related to the applicant's personal affairs. The application fee can be reduced or waived if the applicant would be caused hardship because he/she had to pay the fee. &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Requests should be forwarded to the Head of Corporate Office, NGV PO Box 7259, Melbourne VIC 8004 AUSTRALIA. </p>
