<h3>Privacy Policy </h3>
<p>Thank you for visiting the National Gallery of Art Web site and reviewing our privacy policy. As an independent establishment of the United States, the National Gallery of Art is not covered by the Privacy Act of 1974.  As a matter of policy, however, the Gallery uses that Act as a guide in providing services to the public.</p>
<p>We will collect no personally identifying information about you when you visit our Web site unless you choose to provide that information to us. The information we collect depends upon what you do when visiting our site.</p>
<p><b>If you visit our site to browse, read, or download, we automatically  collect and store only the following information about you:</b><br>
</p><ul>
<li>The IP address from which you access our Web site (an IP address is the number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web);</li>
<li>The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;</li>
<li>The date and time you access our site;</li>
<li>The pages you visit; and</li>
<li>The Internet address of the Web site from which you accessed our site</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors--to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits. We may compile and report aggregate statistics about our users--numbers, traffic patterns, and related site information--but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.</p>
<p><b>If you identify yourself by sending an e-mail containing personal information:</b><br>
You may choose to provide us with personal information in an e-mail message to one of the addresses listed throughout our site (for example, webfeedback, art information, photo requests), or by filling out a survey form with your personal information and submitting it to us through our Web site.  We use that information only to respond to your message and to help us provide you with the material you have requested.</p>
<p><b>If you identify yourself by submitting customer information forms to purchase merchandise in our online Gallery shop: </b><br>
We do not collect or store any information about you that we gather from the customer information form (your name, address, telephone numbers, credit card information, and e-mail address). We use this information only to process your order.</p>
<p>We do not collect or store any information about you that we gather from using "cookies" on our site. A cookie is a snippet of information that our server sends to your browser when you first visit our site.  Our server uses cookies to let you build a shopping order in our online Gallery Shop. Each time you connect, your browser sends the cookie back to our server. We use cookies only to keep track of the items in your shopping order. We do not use cookies to determine where you have been or to store any information about you. </p>
<p><b>Submitting your credit card number:</b><br>
When you submit your credit card number to purchase merchandise from our online Gallery Shop, we offer the use of a secure server.  If you choose to use the secure server, the secure server software (SSL) encrypts the credit card information you submit before it is sent to us. This helps assure that the information is protected against unauthorized access.</p>
<p><b>Site Security</b><br>
For site security purposes and to ensure that this Web site remains available to all users, the Gallery computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
