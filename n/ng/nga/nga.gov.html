<p> We will collect no personally identifying information about you when you
  visit our Web site unless you choose to provide that information to us. The
  information we collect depends upon what you do when visiting our site. </p>
<p> <strong>If you visit our site to browse, read, or download, we automatically collect
  and store only non-personally identifiable information about you, consisting

<p><strong>If you identify yourself by sending an e-mail containing personal
    information:</strong></p>
<p>You may choose to provide us with personal information in an e-mail message
  to one of the addresses listed throughout our site (for example, webfeedback,
  art information, photo requests), or by filling out a survey form with your
  personal information and submitting it to us through our Web site.&nbsp; We
  use that information only to respond to your message and to help us provide
  you with the material you have requested.</p>
