<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Acendre Pty Ltd (ACN 079 099 282) (“Acendre”) respects and upholds
your rights under the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the
Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“Privacy Act”). This Privacy Policy for Acendre
lets you know what personal information of yours we hold, what we do
with it, who we will disclose it to and how you can access the personal
information we hold about you. You can also find out here how to change
inaccurate personal information and how to opt out of receiving
communications from us.</p>
<h3>What personal information about you does Acendre collect and hold?</h3>
<p>Acendre does not collect Personal Information about you when you
visit our website unless you choose to provide us with such information
by submitting an online application to us or make an email enquiry. In
relation to an online application, the information we collect will
include any personal and sensitive information you provide to us to
assess and process your application. In relation to email inquiries,
this information will include your name, email address, address,
employment or company details and any other information you provide to
us in your inquiry.</p>
<p>If you decide to complete an online application form, the information
you enter into the online form will only be collected by us if you
submit your online application.</p>
<h3>How does Acendre collect and hold your personal information?</h3>
<p>Where possible, Acendre will generally collect your personal
information directly from you. Acendre also collects personal
information from its clients in the course of providing services to
them. We may also collect personal information from our website, in
promotional activities such as promotional events and competitions, from
other directly related companies and, where you have provided your
consent, from the organisers of events that we sponsor.</p>
<h3>What does Acendre do with your personal information?</h3>
<p>We will only use and disclose your personal information for the
purposes which you provide it. In relation to inquiries you submit to
us, we will use the information for the purposes of responding to your
inquiry. In respect of online applications submitted to us, we will use
this information to assess and process your application. In respect of
personal information provided to us by our clients, we will use this
information for the purpose of operating and maintaining our clients’
accounts, managing our services and fulfilling our legal and contractual
obligations. <strong></strong></p>
<h3>Who will Acendre disclose your personal information to?</h3>
<p>Acendre may disclose your personal information to Acendre staff
involved in processing your application or inquiry as well as referees
and other third parties who may be required to assist us in processing
your application. We may also disclose your personal information to
advisors, consultants and contractors we ordinarily engage for the above
purposes (such as lawyers, accountants and IT service providers). Due
to the sensitive nature of some of the information that is gathered on
behalf of our clients, we may also require applicants to undertake
security and background clearance checks. Where this is necessary we
will obtain your prior consent.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to third party service
providers overseas who are not subject to similar laws to the Australian
Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). However, where your personal information is
disclosed to an overseas recipient, we will also take adequate measures
to ensure that the personal information is handled by the overseas
recipient in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and our
instructions for the purposes described above. By providing Acendre with
your personal information, you consent to this disclosure of your
personal information.</p>
<h3>Openness</h3>
<p>You may request access to personal information (including your credit
information) we hold about you by contacting the Privacy Officer at the
address below. Where we hold information that you are entitled to
access, we will endeavour to provide you with a suitable range of
choices as to how access is provided (eg emailing or mailing it to you).
A fee may be charged to cover the cost of retrieval.</p>
<p>If at any time you believe that personal information we hold about
you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request
amendment of it and we will either amend the information or make a
record of your comment, as we think appropriate.</p>
<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>Where we have obtained your consent to do so, or in circumstances
where you would reasonably expect that your personal information would
be used or disclosed for this purpose, we may contact you from time to
time with marketing material about our other products or services. At
any time, you may opt out of receiving this material at any time by
contacting us by email to Marketing@Acendre. Your consent to receiving
this information will remain current until you advise us otherwise.
</p>
<h3>Questions and complaints</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or believe that
we have at any time failed to keep one of our commitments to you to
handle your personal information in the manner required by the Privacy
Act, then we ask that you contact us immediately using the following
contact details <a href="mailto:privacy@acendre.net">privacy@acendre.net.</a></p>
<p>We will respond and advise whether we agree with your complaint or
not. If we do not agree, we will provide reasons. If we do agree, we
will advise what (if any) action we consider it appropriate to take in
response. If you are still not satisfied after having contacted us and
given us a reasonable time to respond, then we suggest that you contact
