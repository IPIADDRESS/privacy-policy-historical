<p>NGWeb Solutions wants you to understand how we collect, protect and use your personal information and the choices
  you have about how that information is used. This notice covers all of the information handling practices for the
  NGWeb Solutions companies listed at the end of this notice. However, certain departments and/or products within
these companies may have more restrictive information handling practices.</p>
<h4>Online information
  </h4>
<p>We at NGWeb Solutions are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience, and to protecting
  your personal information during your visit. When you access a NGWeb Solutions Web site (NGWeb Solutions Site),
  you can be sure that your information is protected by the latest security and authentication techniques. We may collect
  information from your visit, in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, but all personally
  identifiable information we collect is held to the standards of this privacy policy.
  </p>
<p>To access NGWeb Solutions products via the NGWeb Solutions Sites, you will need a browser that supports the use of
  Secure Sockets Layer (Netscape 4.0or greater, MS Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater, etc). This encryption technology
  helps ensure the authenticity of your online sessions and secures data being transmitted over the public Internet.
  </p>
<p>If you are using Netscape Navigator, your session is secured if a key appears in the lower left corner of your screen;
  when the session is not secure, the key will appear broken. Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in a locked position
  on the status bar when you enter a secure site. When you leave a secure Web site, Internet Explorer displays a lock in
  an unlocked position on the status bar. If the page you are viewing uses frames, you may not see the key or lock, but
  can simply right-click anywhere in the frame and select “Properties”. If the Web site address (URL) starts with “https”
  the “s” indicates a secure site or area of the site.
</p>
<p>When you enter a NGWeb Solutions Site, you will pass through our security “firewall” and we identify the Internet
  Protocol (IP) address of you computer or handheld device, the IP address won’t identify you personally, but it will let
  us identify the device you’re using and we store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security
  purposes.
  </p>
<p>NGWeb Solutions Sites use cookies in several applications for navigational purposes. A cookie is a small text file
  placed on your hard drive (not on the NGWeb Solutions Site) by a Web page server. Cookies make your Internet
  experience quicker and more convenient. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some
  parts of the NGWeb Solutions Sites may not work properly if you do. Accepting a cookie from a NGWeb Solutions
  Site does not give NGWeb Solutions access to any of your personally identifiable information. Also, the types of
  cookies we use don’t get stored permanently in your computer – they expire immediately after you close your browser
  and are deleted. You may be able to set up your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies
  from being set.
  </p>
<p>If you e-mail questions or comments to us, we will use your e-mail address to reply to you and we will temporarily
  store your e-mail address, your message and our reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and
  regulations. When we collect your e-mail address this way, we won’t use it for marketing our products and services.
  </p>
<p>We don’t knowingly collect, maintain or use personally identifiable information on the NGWeb Solutions Sites from

  unknowingly collected such information we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information from our
  system as soon as possible. We are not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or
  individuals unaffiliated with us whose Web sites may contain links to ours, including vendors where you may shop.
