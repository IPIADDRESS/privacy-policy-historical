During the process of delivering an ad to you, NGOHQ.com does not
collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name,
address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, NGOHQ.com does
obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as
the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your
browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use</small></small></small></big></big></big></p>
<p><big><big><big><small><small><small style="font-weight: bold;">Cookies</small><br>
<small>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied
to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to
any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both
session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie,
once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates (an example
would be the customer login). A persistent cookie is a small text file
stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time.
Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help
file directions.</small></small></small></big></big></big></p>
<p><big><big><big><small><small><small>By setting a cookie on our site,
users would not have to type in a username more than once, thereby
saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may
still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be
limited in most areas of our site. Persistent cookies enable us to
track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience
on our site.</small></small></small></big></big></big></p>

<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>

information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these
surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has

<b>Security</b><br>
This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.
When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their
information is protected both online and off-line
On our site we have programs implemented to protect your email address
in our forums. The only way that your email will be publicly avaliable
is if you choose to "show" your email address in our forums so other
users can contact you.
On the Internet there are "Spam Bots", which surf the Internet and
collect every email address they find and place them in a database,
then they send junk email to all of these users. We have taken it a
step higher in security and
have blocked spam bots from our site.

collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we
disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy
policy under which the information was collected.<br>
