<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting the New York State Unified Court System’s 
  (UCS) web site at <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/">www.courts.state.ny.us</a>. 
  This web site is designed to make it easier and more efficient for the public 
  to interact with the UCS. The UCS recognizes that it is critical for members 
  of the public to be confident that their privacy is protected when they visit 
  the UCS web site and that they are aware of any possible uses of personal information.</p>
<p>Consistent with the provisions of the New York State Internet 
  Security and Privacy Act, State Technology Law 201 et. seq., this policy describes 
  the UCS’s practices regarding information collected from users of this 
  web site. This policy describes what information is collected and how that information 
  is used. Because this privacy policy applies only to this web site, you should 
  examine the privacy policy of other web sites that you access using links from 
  this web site.</p>
<p><b>The UCS does not collect any personal information about 
  you unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an e-mail or

  form.</b></p>
<p>Use of this web site signifies agreement with the terms of 
  this policy.</p>

<p><b><a name="a"></a>INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY WHEN 
  YOU VISIT THIS WEB SITE</b></p>
<p>When you visit this web site, the UCS automatically collects 
  and stores the following information about your visit:</p>
<p>(i) The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used, but 
  not the e-mail address. The Internet Protocol Address is a numerical identifier 
  assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer;</p>
<p>(ii) The type of browser and operating system you used;</p>
<p>(iii) The date and time you visit this site;</p>
<p>(iv) The web pages or services you accessed at this site;</p>
<p>(v) The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site;</p>
<p>(vi) The web site you visit as you leave this web site; and</p>
<p>(vii) Any form or information that you downloaded.</p>
<p>None of the foregoing information is deemed to constitute personal 
  information.</p>
<p>The information that is collected automatically is used to 
  improve this web site’s content and to help the UCS understand how users 
  are interacting with the web site. This information is collected for statistical 
  analysis, to determine what information is of most and least interest to users 
  of the site and to improve the utility of the material available on the web 
  site. This information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes, and 
  the UCS is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose the information collected 
  from the web site for commercial purposes.</p>

<p><b><a name="b"></a>INFORMATION COLLECTED WHEN YOU E-MAIL THIS 
  WEB SITE OR INITIATE AN ONLINE TRANSACTION</b></p>
<p>During your visit to this web site you may send an e-mail to 
  the UCS. Your e-mail address and the contents of your message will be collected. 
  The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include 
  audio, video and graphic information formats included in the message. Your e-mail 
  address and the information included in your message will be used to respond 
  to you, to address issues you identify, to improve this web site, or, where 
  appropriate, to forward your message to another public agency for follow-up. 
  Your e-mail address is not collected for commercial purposes, and the UCS is 
  not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose your e-mail address for commercial 
  purposes.</p>
  During your 
visit to this web site you may initiate a transaction such as a survey, registration 
or order. The information, including personal information, volunteered by you 
in initiating the transaction is used by the UCS to operate UCS programs, which 
may include the provision of goods, services and information. The information 
collected by the UCS may be disclosed by the UCS for those purposes that may be 
reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in connection 
with which the information was submitted. (For example, responses to a survey 
regarding the operation of the UCS web site may be used to improve services offered 
on the web site.) Except for ongoing voluntary transactions, the UCS does not 
store information that allows the web site to recognize users when they visit 
the web site again. 
<p>The UCS, in general, 
  does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles 
  of children through this web site. To the extent that UCS provides the opportunity 
  for children to e-mail questions or comments, the UCS does not share the information 
  received with third parties or create profiles of children using such information. 
  Users are cautioned, however, that, other than in a special program directed 
  at questions and comments by children, the collection of personal information 
  submitted in an e-mail will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, 
  and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to 
  public access. The UCS strongly encourages parents, guardians, and teachers 
  to be involved in children’s Internet activities and to provide guidance 
  whenever children are asked to provide personal information online.</p>

<p><b><a name="c"></a>INFORMATION 
  AND CHOICE</b></p>
<p>As noted above, 
  the UCS does not collect any personal information about you during your visit 
  to this web site unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending 
  an e-mail or initiating an online transaction such as a survey, registration 
  or order. You may choose not to send an e-mail, respond to a survey, or complete 
  an order form. While your choice not to participate in these activities may 
  limit your ability to receive specific services, products, publications, or 
  information through this web site, it will not prevent you from requesting services, 
  products, publications, or information from UCS by other means and will not 
  normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features 
  of the web site, including browsing or downloading publicly available information.</p>

<p><b><a name="d"></a>DISCLOSURE 
  OF INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THIS WEB SITE</b></p>
<p>The collection 
  of information through this web site and the disclosure of that information 
  are subject to the provisions of the New York State Internet Security and Privacy 
  Act, State Technology Law 201 et. seq. and other applicable law. The UCS will 
  collect personal information through this web site or disclose personal information 
  collected through this web site only if the user has consented to the collection 
  or disclosure of such personal information. The voluntary disclosure of personal 
  information to the UCS by the user, whether solicited or unsolicited, constitutes 
  consent to the collection and disclosure of the information by the UCS for the 
  purposes for which the user disclosed the information to the UCS, as reasonably 
  ascertainable from the nature and terms of the disclosure.</p>
<p> For example, 
  the use of the UCS Case Trac and Filing by Electronic Means services involves 
  the voluntary provision of personal information for billing and other purposes. 
  UCS does not sell or give this information to anyone. The UCS may, however, 
  use the information collected in connection with Case Trac, Filing by Electronic 
  Means and similar services internally to market other UCS products and services.</p>
<p>However, the UCS 
  may collect or disclose personal information without user consent if the collection 
  or disclosure is: (1) necessary to perform the statutory duties of the UCS, 
  or necessary for the UCS to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized 
  by state or federal statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order 
  or by law; (3) for the purpose of validating the identity of the user; or (4) 
  of information to be used solely for statistical purposes that is in a form 
  that cannot be used to identify any particular person.</p>
<p>The UCS may disclose 
  personal information to federal or state law enforcement authorities in the 
  course of officially authorized law enforcement investigations or to enforce 
  the UCS’s rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized 
  access to the UCS’s information technology assets (for example, to protect 
  against hackers).</p>

  records retention and disposition requirements contained in Part 104 of the 
  Rules of the Chief Administrator of the Courts. Information on those requirements 
  may be found on this web site at <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/chiefadmin/104.shtml">http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/chiefadmin/104.shtml</a>.</p>

  committed to protecting personal information collected through this web site 
  against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Consequently, the UCS limits 
  employee access to personal information collected through this web site to only 
  those employees who need access to the information in the performance of their 
  official duties. Employees who have access to this information are required 
  to follow appropriate procedures in connection with any disclosures of personal 
  information.</p>
<p> In addition, 
  UCS has implemented procedures to safeguard the integrity of its information 
  technology assets, including but not limited to, authentication, monitoring, 
  auditing, and encryption. These security procedures have been integrated into 
  the design, implementation, and day-to-day operations of this web site as part 
  of a continuing commitment to the security of electronic content as well as 
  the electronic transmission of information.</p>
<p>For web site security 
  purposes and to maintain the availability of the web site for all users, the 
  UCS employs software to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to
