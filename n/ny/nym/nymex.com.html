      <p>The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (the "Exchange" or "we") 
        supports a policy of openness regarding the collection and use of our 
        customers' personal information. We have adopted and implemented this 
        privacy policy ("Policy") as part of our commitment to protecting 
        your personal information from misuse. We encourage you to read this Policy 
        to learn more about the ways we collect, use, disclose, and protect the 
        information we gather from this web site (the "Site"). If you 
        are not comfortable with any of the practices or policies described in 
        this Policy, we ask that you discontinue use of our Site. Please be aware 
        that we may periodically update or revise this Policy without notice. 
        Accordingly, please check this Policy frequently for changes.</p>
      <p>Please note that information gathered in connection with any services 
        provided via the Site may be governed by separate terms and conditions 
        including, but not limited to, the <b>Exchange OTC Services Site Terms 
        of Use</b> and the <b>Exchange Rules</b> (collectively referred to herein 
        as "Other Terms"). In the event that you receive such services, 
        you agree that those Other Terms shall supercede any conflicting terms 
        contained in this Policy. </p>
      <p><b>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</b></p>
      <p>In order to better serve your particular needs, the Exchange (and third 
        parties working on the Exchange's behalf) may collect information from 
        you while visiting our Site. Some of this information is collected automatically 
        through various methods including, but not limited to cookies. The Exchange 
        may also obtain information directly from you and, depending upon the 
        nature of transactions you may conduct, from third party sources.</p>
      <p>We also collect anonymous information, which does not personally identify 
        you, when you visit our Site. The anonymous information includes the pages 
        you view on our Site, the search terms you enter into our search utility, 
        your IP address and the operating system, browser software and Internet 
        service provider you use. </p>
      <p>We may use the standard "cookie" feature of major browser applications 
        and other data capture mechanisms that allow us to store data about your 
        visit. Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which 
        areas need improvement. You may configure your browser to prevent cookies 
        from being set on your computer. If you do so, you may still view most 
        of the Site, although you may not be able to enjoy all of our services.</p>
      <p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>
      <p>In addition to the information automatically collected when you visit 
        our Site, the Exchange collects personally identifiable information directly 
        from you and, in some circumstances, from those individuals and/or entities 
        you may authorize to act on your behalf. In addition, we may collect other 
        required information in order to provide you with services tailored to 
        your particular needs. The information we collect will vary depending 
        upon the information, service, function or process you select. For example, 
        you may be required to provide your name, address, birth date, phone number, 
        credit card data, the last four digits of your social security number 
        and your e-mail address in order to register for certain services. By 
        learning a little about you, the Exchange delivers more relevant content 
        and product offerings and thus offers you better services.</p>
      <p>The Exchange may also collect personally identifiable information by 
        monitoring the Site for the Exchange's own purposes (including, without 
        limitation, for purposes of maintaining the functional and operational 
        integrity of the Site and for purposes of complying with applicable laws 
        and regulations), and not for your benefit. The Exchange reserves the 
        right to cooperate fully with state, local, federal, and international 
        legal, governmental and regulatory entities, authorities and officials 
        in any investigation or governmental, legal or regulatory proceeding relating 
        to any information collected and/or Site content (including personal or 
        private electronic communication transmitted via the Site) or to any purported 
        unlawful activities of any Site visitor.</p>
      <p><b>Site Users</b></p>
      <p>With the exception of the educational resources contained on the Site, 
        the Site is not intended for children under eighteen (18) years of age.

        eighteen (18) years of age or knowingly collect any information from children 
        under eighteen (18) years of age.</p>
      <p><b>Postings/Instant Messaging </b></p>
      <p>Postings by visitors on any message board or in any chat room (other 
        than instant messaging conversations facilitated by the Exchange) will 
        not be protected as confidential. The Exchange may use any such postings 
        on the Site, any content thereof, and any information derived from any 
        such postings (including any ideas, concepts, know-how or other intellectual 
        property) ("Postings") and may provide such Postings to any 
        of its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, or others, for any 
        purpose whatsoever, as deemed appropriate in the sole discretion of the 
        Exchange.</p>
      <p>The Exchange is under no obligation to review any Postings and assumes 
        no responsibility or liability relating to any Postings. Nonetheless, 
        the Exchange may from time to time monitor the Postings on the Site and 
        may remove and/or decline to accept (i) any Postings that contain any 
        unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, 
        obscene, profane, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable 
        material of any kind, including, but not limited to, any material which 
        encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, gives rise 
        to civil liability or otherwise violates any applicable local, state, 
        national or international law; (ii) advertisements or solicitations of 
        any kind; (iii) messages posted by visitors impersonating others; (iv) 
        personal information, such as messages which state phone numbers, social 
        security numbers, account numbers, addresses, or employer references; 
        (v) messages by non-spokesperson employees of the Exchange purporting 
        to speak on behalf of the Exchange; (vi) messages that offer unauthorized 
        downloads of any copyrighted or private information; (vii) multiple messages 
        placed within individual folders by the same visitor restating the same 
        point; and (viii) chain letters of any kind.</p>

        rights, property, or personal safety of the Exchange, its affiliates, 
        and/or the respective customers, members, directors, officers, employees, 
        agents, and representatives of the Exchange and its affiliates; other

      <p><b>SECURITY</b></p>
      <p>We use a secure server and security protocol to safeguard information 
        we collect from you. To help ensure the security of your personal and 
        financial information that you submit to us via our Site (other than via 
        an e-mail message), we use security software to encrypt the information 
        before and during its transmission through the Internet. We allow information 
        to be submitted for transmission only if your browser is compatible with 
        our security software. If your browser is not compatible, you will receive 
        a message indicating your transaction cannot be completed because of the 
        security risk. </p>
      <p>E-mail messages are not secure. Our security software does not encrypt 
        e-mail messages. Please keep in mind that transmitting information via 
        the Internet is never completely secure and that, therefore, any information 
        submitted may be intercepted, viewed, collected, used, altered, copied 
        or disclosed by others. We are not responsible for the security or confidentiality 
        of communications you send to us (or that we send to you) through the 
        Internet using e-mail messages. As such, users must immediately change 
        any initial passwords provided by the Exchange pursuant to any services 
        provided via the Site. </p>
      <p>We take seriously the issue of safeguarding your privacy online. However, 
        please note that you should exercise discretion with respect to the submission 
        of any personal or financial information. We encourage customers either 
        to send confidential correspondence through the postal service or to telephone 
        our employees directly. </p>
      <p><b>LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</b></p>
      <p>This Site contains links to Web sites of third parties. Please note that 
        when you click on one of these links, you will be accessing a Web site 
        the Exchange does not control and which may be governed by privacy policies 
        and practices that differ from ours. The Exchange is not, and will not 
        be, responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third parties 
        or the content or security of any third party Web sites. </p>
      <p><b>CONSENT</b></p>

        the terms and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless superceded

        you consent to collection and use of your information as described in
