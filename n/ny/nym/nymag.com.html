</p><p>Safeguarding your privacy is very important to us.  We take seriously the collection of any personally identifiable information and personal contact information ("personal information") from our visitors and are committed to protecting each visitor's privacy in accordance with these policies.   We use the term "visitors" to include registered members of our website communities and any other person that accesses our websites at any point for any amount of time, unless designated otherwise.  Please carefully review our information collection practices and privacy protections below. 

	
</p><p><b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who We Are And How To Reach Us </b>

 

</p><p>New York Metro ("New York Metro") owns and operates the Newyorkmetro.com website.  New York Metro is the only operator of this website.  You may contact us directly if you have any questions regarding the content and material on our website or if you have any questions about our privacy policies.  Please contact us at:

708 3rd Avenue, 6th Floor<br>

New York, NY 10017<br>

Attention:  Craig Unger, General Manager<br>
        <a href="mailto:cunger@newyorkmetro.com">cunger@newyorkmetro.com</a></b></p>
<p><a name="anchor1"></a>

 <b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;Website Membership and Participation Eligibility</b>

 

</p><p>You must be thirteen (13) years of age or older to be a member of our website and receive membership benefits, and you must be eighteen (18) years of age or older to participate in our A-List Invitations.  We may conduct other contests, sweepstakes and/or special events over our site.  To participate in these events, you must meet the designated minimum age requirements (for example, twenty-one years of age or older) for the specific event.  Please see our <a href="terms.htm">Terms of Usage Agreement</a> for additional information on membership and/or participation on our website.



      
</p><p>

 <b>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection of Personal Information</b>

 

 
</p><p>We provide various informative, educational, and entertaining features as part of this website.  To operate these features, we collect certain non-personal and personal information from our visitors for specific purposes.  For website activities that request personal information, you agree to provide accurate and current information about yourself.  Your membership and/or participation in our website activities will be canceled without notice if at any time we discover that you provide false information, or violate any term of our Privacy Policy or our <a href="terms.htm">Terms of Usage Agreement</a>.  We may retain personal information for an indefinite amount of time to preserve our database and to comply with various federal and state laws.  

 

  
</p><p>

 <b>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration for Participation in Website Activities and Services</b>

 
<a name="anchor3"></a>
 
</p><p><b>V. Use and Collection of Information by Newyorkmetro.com</b>

 
</p><p>To participate as a member of our website, or in online activities, special events, contests, sweepstakes or Interactive Areas ("Interactive Areas" include chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards or auditoriums), you may be required to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, telephone number, birth date and gender ("personal information").  We may also survey visitors about various topics, including local events and experiences, television viewing preferences and how we can improve our website and services.  Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary.

 
</p><p>We collect personal information for several important purposes, including to operate our membership base, protect the security of our visitors and the site, improve our program service and website, distribute our newsletter, notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes, allow participation in specified activities or Interactive Areas and for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program service or website.

 
</p><p>We may also offer an "E-card" feature that allows visitors to send an e-mail version of a post card or website link to another person to inform them about the New York Metro site and our features.  We do not collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail information on E-cards.

 
</p><p>The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you through our website.  This website does not collect additional personal information about individual visitors or members from other sources.  This means that a person can visit our website and navigate through the site without giving us personal information.  To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we may collect non-personal information about our members and visitors, such as Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, clickstream information, the webpage from which a person enters our site, webpages visited, duration of visit and domain type.  This information does not reveal a visitor's personal identity.  

 
</p><p>We may produce certain contests, sweepstakes and special events with the support of affiliated or non-affiliated sponsors and/or promotional partners.  The personal information collected by our website in conjunction with such events may also be used for the marketing of additional services and events by New York Metro and/or its promotional partners and sponsors beyond the contest, sweepstakes and/or special event.  Depending on the event, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out").  For each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will post on the website applicable rules for the event, and if necessary, post any supplemental terms and conditions or privacy provisions.  To the extent there is a conflict between those privacy provisions and this policy, the privacy provisions for the specific event will govern.

 
</p><p><b>VI. Use and Collection of Information by Operational Providers</b>

 
</p><p>For the convenience of our visitors, we may provide the opportunity to purchase certain goods, merchandise and services through this website.  Companies other than New York Metro, its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries may handle some of these transactions.  We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations, order fulfillment and/or contract services "operational providers."  If you choose to use these optional services, our operational providers will request your personal information to fulfill your order or request.  The voluntary submission of your personal information to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies.  To facilitate an order or request, we may share your personal information with the provider.  The operational provider may also share your personal information with us.  We will store this information in our membership database.

 
</p><p>In most instances, we request that our operational providers adhere to the provisions in New York Metro's Privacy Policy and that such providers only share visitors' personal information with New York Metro, unless necessary to complete a visitor's request or order.  We also request that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling the requested service or order.  However, you must read an operational providers privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal information collected online.

 
</p><p>New York Metro, its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of operational providers, nor is the New York Metro family responsible or liable for the products or services provided by operational providers.




  
</p><p>
<a name="anchor4"></a>
 <b>VII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information to Parties Other than New York Metro</b>

 

 
</p><p>We only share or disclose your personal information with companies other than New York Metro when it is required by law, disclosure is necessary to operate the website or certain website services, to protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property and/or when disclosure is consistent with New York Metro's practices for services that are similarly provided offline. 

 
</p><p>New York Metro is a partnership between Primedia Inc.'s New York Magazine and Metro Channel L.L.C., a subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc.  We may in the future share personal information with our parents, partners, affiliates or other entities for other purposes.  If we decide to enter into such sharing arrangements, we will disclose to our registered members and in this Privacy Policy the name of the entity(s) that we will share information with, what type of personal information will be shared, how the information will be used, and how to contact us if you do not want us to share your personal information ("opt-out").  We may conduct joint activities with members of the New York Metro family; however, we will not share individual visitors' personal information with these entities unless we provide notice in this Privacy Policy.

 
</p><p>When visitors send an e-mail to us, we will protect your e-mail address and other personal contact information.  However, we may disclose the content of your e-mail to other persons.  Please see our Terms of Usage Agreement.  We may share your personal information with our operational providers or those persons, companies or agents who provide support for the internal operations of the website, such as contest fulfillment services, maintenance and technical services, and e-commerce and auction contractors.  If you are purchasing goods, merchandise or services on this website and use a credit card to complete the transaction, our operational providers may share your personal information and credit card number with a ticket agent, a credit card processing and/or a shipping/fulfillment company in order to complete your order.   

 
</p><p>We may collect and provide aggregate information about our visitors to our advertisers, sponsors, promotional partners, and affiliates, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the site or page, or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information does not include personal information about any individual visitor.  We may obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal any personal information about a specific visitor.

 <b>VIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of Cookies and Tracking Devices</b>

 

 
</p><p>This site uses cookies or other tracking devices.  A cookie is a small data file that contains a unique identification number that a website places on your hard drive when you visit a site.  The "cookie" is able to store information such as data about your computer, the type of browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain site.  Cookies do not allow the website to access personal information that you haven't already provided.  Cookies enable us to track how often visitors are visiting our website and specific pages, the number of entries in specific events, the estimated audience size for sponsors and advertisers, and user preferences.  You can refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser.  Please contact your software manufacturer for questions on how to disable your cookies.  You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of this site.  However, you may find that some areas on the website will be slower, or may not function at all, and you may not be able to participate in certain activities such as contests or sweepstakes if the cookies are disabled. 

 
</p><p>This site uses clear GIFs [Graphics Interchange Formats] (also known as pixel tags, web beacons or web bugs).  A clear GIF is a tiny line of code only 1 by 1 pixel in size that is programmed to collect certain information about a visit to a particular website.

New York Metro respects the privacy of your child and we want to share with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen.  We have developed this site to appeal to visitors over the age of thirteen.  Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website, we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of thirteen.  If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen has improperly registered on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation, and delete the child's personally identifiable information, user name and password from our records.

<p>If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law:

</p><ul><li>To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian;

	</li><li>To respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's

		information;   

</li><li>To fulfill a child's request for a subscription to a online newspaper, magazine or specific information on a regular basis and we will notify the parent or guardian before we contact the child again;

	</li><li>To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; and

	</li><li>To protect the security or integrity of the site, take precautions against liability, respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law.
</li></ul>


<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy.
