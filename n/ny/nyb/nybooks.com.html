<h2>Privacy statement</h2>

<p>The New York Review of Books is committed to protecting your privacy. In order to fully understand your rights, we encourage you to read this privacy statement. Please direct questions regarding this statement to <a href="mailto:web@nybooks.com">web@nybooks.com</a>.</p>

<p class="message-subject"><b><a name="collect"></a>When does The New York Review of Books collect my personal information?</b></p>

<p>The New York Review of Books gathers information from members and visitors via voluntary registration, cookie technology, and IP addresses.</p>

<p><b>Registration</b>: When you create an account on nybooks.com, we collect information that helps us identify you. At the initial registration screen we ask for your name, your email address, and a password. When you order something from us such as a book or a subscription, we also ask for your name, shipping address, telephone number, and your credit card number and expiration date. This information is necessary for us to process your order.  <i>We will not share any of this personal information without your consent.</i></p>

<p><b>Cookies</b>: A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most Internet sites use cookies. We use cookies to store and track your preferences; for instance, to remember what you have placed in your shopping cart. You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies, but this will prevent you from using most customized services. Cookies make your experience easier by saving your preferences and passwords.</p>

<p><b>IP address</b>: An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet. When you visit a particular Web page on the The New York Review of Books site, our server logs your IP address. We may log IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, or to report information in aggregate form to our retail partners and advertisers (e.g., how many visitors logged in to our Web site) in a form that is not personally identifiable. 

</p><p class="message-subject"><b><a name="share"></a>Who does The New York Review of Books share information with?</b></p>

<p>We will not disclose your personal information to third parties, except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under circumstances required by law. We will disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that any applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of another member. We also disclose aggregated member statistics in order to describe our services and audience to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. However aggregate data is not traceable to you specifically.</p>

<p class="message-subject"><b><a name="control"></a>What are my options to control the use of my personal information?</b></p>

<p>Most browsers can be configured to reject cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent. You may cancel your registration to The New York Review of Books and/or request the removal of your personal information from our member records by sending email to <a href="mailto:web@nybooks.com">web@nybooks.com</a>. We will send an email to confirm your request. After you respond, we will remove your information from our database. Residual information may remain in our archives and records, but this information will not be used for a commercial purpose. We reserve the right to maintain information on registered members who have violated our terms and conditions, or who have had their access to The New York Review of Books blocked, in order to detect repeat offenders.</p>

<p class="message-subject"><b><a name="know"></a>What else should I know about my privacy?</b></p>

<p>You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information online in a public area, that information might be collected and used by others. We do not control the actions of our visitors and registered users. If you disclose personal information in a forum or any other publicly accessible place on the The New York Review of Books site, you do so at your own risk and you understand that your information may be collected and used by others.</p>

<p>Please remember that protection of your privacy begins with you. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password you use to register, and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing information online.</p>

<p>This Web site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When you place orders we use a secure server, which encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. All of the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access.</p>

<p>The New York Review of Books will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or the disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process, (2) protect and defend our rights and property, (3) protect our customers or users from misuse or unauthorized use of the The New York Review of Books Web site, or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our customers or the public.</p>

<p>The The New York Review of Books Web site may contain links to other sites, operated by third parties, that we think may be of interest to you.  The New York Review of Books encourages third parties to follow appropriate privacy standards and policies, but is not responsible for the actions of those third parties, the content of their web sites, or any practices they may follow.</p>

<p class="message-subject"><b><a name="acceptance"></a>How do I accept this privacy statement?</b></p>

<p>By using the The New York Review of Books site and services, you signify your acceptance of this privacy statement. If you do not agree or are not comfortable with any policy described in this privacy statement, your only remedy is to discontinue use of the The New York Review of Books site.
