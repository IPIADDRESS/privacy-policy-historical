However aggregate data is not personally identifying and not traceable to you specifically</p>
<p><strong>Subscription Purchases and Website Registration</strong>: When purchasing a subscription, we ask for your name, shipping and billing addresses, telephone number, and your credit card number and expiration date. This information is necessary for us to process your order regardless of method of purchase. We will not share any of this personal information without your consent, except as specifically stated in our General Policy above. You may optionally create an account on nybooks.com/nybooks.info in order to access content on our website. In order to create an account on nybooks.com/nybooks.info, we collect information that helps us identify you.

<p><strong>Cookies</strong>: Cookies are small text files that can be used by websites to make a user’s experience more efficient. You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies, but this will prevent you from using most customized services. We use cookies to grant access to paywalled content, to personalize content and ads, to provide social media features, and to analyze our traffic.

When you visit a particular web page on <em>The New York Review of Books</em>site, our server logs your IP address. We may log IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, or to report information in aggregate form to our retail partners and advertisers (e.g., how many visitors logged in to our website) in a form that is not personally identifying. If you are accessing the website via an Institutional Subscription, we also use IP addresses to identify access levels to nybooks.com.</p></blockquote>
