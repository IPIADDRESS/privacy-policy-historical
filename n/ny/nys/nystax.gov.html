<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Information Collected
When You Send DTF an E-mail or Conduct an Online Transaction through this Web
site</font></h3>
<p>During
your visit to this Web site you may send an e-mail to DTF. Your

This includes, for example, filling out an online survey or order form or

information, including personal information, volunteered by you in conducting
the transaction is used by DTF to operate DTF programs, which include the
provision of services and information. The

<p>DTF
does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles
of children through this Web site. Users

parents and teachers to be involved in children’s Internet activities and to
provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information online. </p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Information and Choice</font></h3>
<p>As noted above, DTF does not collect any

to utilize any of DTF’s online services. While
your choice not to participate in these activities may limit your ability to
receive specific services through this Web site, it will not prevent you from
requesting services from DTF by other means (e.g., by telephone or United States mail or similar delivery service) and will not
normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features of
the Web site, including browsing or downloading publicly available information. </p>
