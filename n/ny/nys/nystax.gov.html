</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">DTF
does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles
of children through this Web site. Users
are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information submitted in

to utilize any of DTF’s online services. While
your choice not to participate in these activities may limit your ability to
receive specific services through this Web site, it will not prevent you from
requesting services from DTF by other means (e.g., by telephone or United States mail or similar delivery service) and will not
normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features of
the Web site, including browsing or downloading publicly available information.
</font></p>
