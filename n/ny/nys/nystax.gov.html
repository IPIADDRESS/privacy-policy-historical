<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Cookies</font></h3>
<p>The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet Web sites. 
The DTF Web site uses cookies. Cookies are small files stored on your computer by your Web browser to provide a means
of distinguishing among users of the Web site. The cookies DTF utilizes do not contain personal information and do not compromise
your privacy or security. </p>
<p>The software and hardware you use to access the Web site allows you to refuse new
cookies or delete existing cookies. Refusing or deleting cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of some features of
this Web site. </p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Information Collected
When You Send DTF an E-mail or Conduct an Online Transaction through this Web
site</font></h3>
<p>During
your visit to this Web site you may send an e-mail to DTF. Your
e-mail address and the contents of your message will be collected. Your e-mail address and the information included in your message will be
used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to improve this Web

<p>During
your visit to this Web site you may conduct an online transaction.
This includes, for example, filling out an online survey or order form or
utilizing any of DTF’s online services. The
information, including personal information, provided by you in conducting
the transaction is used by DTF to operate DTF programs, which include the
provision of services and information. The
information collected by DTF may, to the extent permitted by law, be disclosed
by DTF for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and
terms of the transaction in connection with which the information was submitted. </p>
<p>DTF
does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles
of children through this Web site. Users
are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information submitted in
an e-mail will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may,
unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public
access. DTF strongly encourages
parents and teachers to be involved in children’s Internet activities and to
provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information online. </p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Information and Choice</font></h3>
<p>As noted above, DTF does not collect any
personal information about you during your visit to this Web site unless you
provide that information voluntarily by sending an e-mail or conducting an
online transaction. This includes,
for example, filling out an online survey or order form or utilizing any of
DTF’s online services. You may choose <strong>not</strong> to send an e-mail, <strong>not</strong> to fill out a survey or online order form and/or <strong>not</strong>
to utilize any of DTF’s online services. While
your choice not to participate in these activities may limit your ability to
receive specific services through this Web site, it will not prevent you from
requesting services from DTF by other means (e.g., by telephone or United States mail or similar delivery service) and will not
normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features of
the Web site, including browsing or downloading publicly available information. </p>
