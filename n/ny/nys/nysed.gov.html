			  <h2>Internet Privacy and Security Policy</h2>
				<p>Your online privacy is important. This section of the State Education Department’s
				Website provides information about this agency's approach to information from
				online visitors as well as general information about online privacy.</p>
		  <p>This section of the Website is divided into several topics.  You can scroll 
				through the entire section.  Or you can go directly to one of the topics listed 
		  below and on the navigation bar above.</p>
		<h2 class="bold">SED INTERNET PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
		<p>This section describes the State Education Department's online information practice regarding 
		the information collected from visitors to our Website and ways in which the office uses and 
		maintains this information.</p>
		<p>The SED Website has three main purposes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Provide useful information concerning educational policy and practice in New York 
			and a description of the work of the State Education Department.</li>
			<li>Provide a means to communicate with staff of the State Education Department.
			You can use this Website as a convenient alternative to mail or telephone communication.</li>
			<li>Provide an electronic medium for local educational agencies to submitdata and 
			conduct business with SED</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The SED Website collects two kinds of information:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Information you decide to give us, which may include personally identifiable information (PII); and</li>
			<li>Non-personal information your computer automatically provides to every Website you visit. 
			This is sometimes referred to as "navigation" information.  The SED retains this information 
		  only for a short time.</li>
		</ol>

			in-person visits. For example, you can
			  <ul>
					<li>send SED staff messages or</li>
					<li>request information</li>
			  </ul>
			  SED retains this information and protects it just as if you had sent it by mail.</td>

			<li>If you request a publication, the SED needs your name and street address to send it to you.</li>
			<li>  If you are the authorized agent for a local educational

		<td class="bold">Information your computer 
	    automatically provides to all Websites</td>

		"navigation" information to every Website you visit, including the SED Website.
		The navigation information includes:
		  <ol>
				<li>The address (also known as URL, short for "uniform resource locator") of any Web page you visited before you linked to an SED Web page.</li>
				<li>Your Internet Protocol address (or "IP address"). This is 
                the Internet's address for your particular computer. A Website's 
                computer must know your IP address so the site can send the Web

				<li>The Web-browsing software you are using.</li>

				<li>Your online service provider.</li>

		  </ol>
			For example, if you have an AOL account, were visiting a page on the Yahoo site, and clicked on a link to the SED home page, your computer would transmit to the SED Website that:
			<ol>

				<li>You use a particular browser software version such as Internet Explorer 5.0.</li>
				<li>You were just visiting a particular page on www.yahoo.com.</li>

		  <ol>
				<li>This data allows SED staff to measure visitors' interest in different sections of the Website, so the SED can make the site more useful to visitors.</li>
				<li>The SED generates internal reports that identify the number of web users on a given day who requested pages through particular online service providers.

		<td class="bold">Identifiability of domain names and IP addresses</td>
		<td>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="bold">Identifiability of your domain name</span>: If you access the Internet through facilities provided by an organization such as your school or business, your automatic navigation information may reveal the name of your organization.  For example, a student's navigation information might let a Website know that the student accesses the Internet through
                  www.myuniversity.edu.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Geographic area</span>:  Similarly, if you access the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) located in a particular geographic area, a Website may be able to use the ISP's identity to infer that to be your geographic location.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Identifiability of your IP address</span>:  Whether your IP address is identifiable depends on whether it is dynamic or static.  If it is dynamic, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) assigns a different IP address for each online visit that does not  identify any person or machine.</li>
			</ol>
		  <p>In contrast, if you access the Internet through an ISP that assigns you a static or fixed IP address (for example, DSL or cable modem service), your IP address will always be the same, and will identify your computer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="bold">GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT COOKIES AND CLEAR GIFs ("WEB BUGS")</h2>
<p>Although the SED does not use persistent cookies or clear GIFs ("Web bugs") on this Website, many sites do use this technology.   Here is some helpful information.</p>
<h3 class="bold">Cookies</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="bold">A cookie is...</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
			  <li>A cookie is a small data file placed on your hard drive by a Website so it can  "remember" information about you or your computer.
			    <ul>
						<li>A Website may assign you an ID and create a
                          temporary cookie with that ID number on your computer.</li>
						<li>The Website then can create a profile with your ID number on the Website's server.</li>
						<li>In your profile, the Website can store information about your interests and other characteristics.  For example, a site that carries news and weather might record your zip code so it can display local weather and news each time you visit the site.   A credit card or bank site might use your profile to store your password, so that it has a way to recognize you and display your account information.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>A cookie can be read and updated only by the Website that created it.  One Website cannot "peek" at another Website's cookies.</li>
			</ul></td>

		<td class="bold">A cookie is not...&nbsp;</td>

			<ul>
				<li>A cookie is not a program.  It is a data file.</li>

<table width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="bold">A clear GIF is...</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Another common way that web sites collect information about you is by using technology called clear GIF or "Web bug" (also referred to as a "1-by-1 GIF," "pixel tag," or  "Web beacon").</li>
				<li>A clear GIF is an invisible image that can be imbedded in a Web page or certain kinds of e-mail.  ("GIF" stands for "graphical interface format," which is one of the technologies used to show pictures in a Web page.)</li>
				<li>As with cookies, a Website can use clear GIFs to collect data about you.</li>
				<li>Unlike cookies, clear GIFs are not stored on your computer.</li>

<h2 class="bold">GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY</h2>
<p>The SED does not solicit information from children under the age of thirteen.  If the SED receives information submitted by children under the age of thirteen, those communications are accorded the same protections as if the information had been submitted offline.</p>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA") imposes restrictions on commercial Websites, not government agency websites.  Although COPPA does not apply to the SED Website, the SED practices are consistent with its mandates.
