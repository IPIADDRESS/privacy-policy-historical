			  <h2>Internet Privacy and Security Policy</h2>
				<p>Your online privacy is important. This section of the New York State Education Departmentâ€™s
				(NYSED) Website provides information about this agency's approach to information from
				online visitors as well as general information about online privacy.</p>
		        <p>This policy is divided into several topics; you can scroll 
			through the sections or use the links above.</p>
		  <h2 class="bold">NYSED INTERNET PRIVACY <a name="PRIVACY" id="PRIVACY"></a>POLICY</h2>
		  <p>This section describes the New York State Education Department's online information practice regarding 
		the information collected from visitors to our Website and ways in which the office uses and 
		maintains this information.</p>
		  <p>The NYSED Website has three main purposes:</p>
		  <ol>
			<li>Provide useful information concerning educational policy and practice in New York 
			and a description of the work of the NYSED.</li>
			<li>Provide a means to communicate with staff of the NYSED.
			You can use this Website as a convenient alternative to mail or telephone communication.</li>
			<li>Provide an electronic medium for local educational agencies to submit data and 
			conduct business with the NYSED.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The NYSED Website collects two kinds of information:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Information you decide to give us, which may include personally identifiable information (PII); and</li>
			<li>Non-personal information your computer automatically provides to every Website you visit. 
			This is sometimes referred to as "navigation" information.  The NYSED retains this information 
		  only for a short time.</li>
		</ol>

					<li>request information.</li>
			  </ul>
			  The NYSED retains this information and protects it just as if you had sent it by mail.</td>

		  brochures or press releases â€” you <span class="bold">do not</span> transmit PII.</p>

		The navigation information includes:
		  <ol>
				<li>The address (also known as URL, short for "uniform resource locator") of any Web page you visited before you linked to a  NYSED Web page.</li>
				<li>Your Internet Protocol address (IP). This is 
                the Internet's address for your particular computer. A Website's 
                computer must know your IP address so the site can send the Web

                  www.myuniversity.edu.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Geographic area</span>:  Similarly, if you access the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) located in a particular geographic area, a Website may be able to use the ISP's identity to infer that to be your geographic location.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Identifiability of your IP address</span>:  Whether your IP address is identifiable depends on whether it is dynamic or static.  If it is dynamic, your ISP assigns a different IP address for each online visit that does not  identify any person or machine.</li>

						<li>A Website may assign you an ID and create a
                          temporary cookie with that ID number on your computer.</li>
						<li>The Website then can create a profile with your ID number on the Website's server.</li>
						<li>In your profile, the Website can store information about your interests and other characteristics.  For example, a site that carries news and weather might record your zip code so it can display local weather and news each time you visit the site.   A credit card or bank site might use your profile to store your password, so that it has a way to recognize you and display your account information.</li>
