<p>The SED Website has three main purposes:</p><ol>
	<li>Provide useful information concerning educational policy and practice in New York and a description of the work of the State Education Department.<br>
    </li><li>Provide a means to communicate with staff of the State Education Department.  You can use this Website as a convenient alternative to mail or telephone communication.<br>
    </li><li>Provide an electronic medium for local educational agencies to submit
      data&nbsp; and conduct business with SED&nbsp;	
</li></ol>
<p>The SED Website collects two kinds of information:
  </p><ol>
	<li>Information you decide to give us, which may include personally
      identifiable information (PII); and<br>
    </li><li>Non-personal information your computer automatically provides to every Website you visit.  This is sometimes referred to as "navigation" information.
