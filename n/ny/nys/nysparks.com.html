		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		
		<p>Thank you for visiting the New York State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation 
		(OPRHP) website. This website is designed to make it easier and more efficient for individuals 
		and businesses to interact with New York State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. 
		OPRHP recognizes that it is critical for individuals and businesses to be confident that their 
		privacy is protected when they visit the OPRHP website.</p>
        
		<p>Consistent with the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act, the Freedom of 
		Information Law and the Personal Privacy Protection Law, this policy describes OPRHP's privacy 
		practices regarding information collected from users of this website. This policy describes 
		what data is collected and how that information is used. OPRHP may, at its sole discretion, 
		change modify, add, or delete portions of this policy. Because this privacy policy only 
		applies to this website, you should examine the privacy policy of any website, including other 
		State websites, you access through this website.</p>

		<p>For purposes of this policy, "personal information" means any information concerning a 
		natural person, as opposed for instance to a corporate entity, which, because of name, number, 
		symbol, mark, or other identifier, can be used to identify that natural person. OPRHP only 
		collects personal information about you when you provide that information voluntarily by 
		sending an e-mail or by initiating an online transaction, such as a survey, registration or 
		order form.</p>

		<p><b>Information Collected Automatically When You Visit this Website</b><br>
		When visiting this website OPRHP automatically collects and stores the following information 
		about your visit:</p>

		<ol type="1">
			<li>The Internet Protocol address and domain name of your Internet service provider.The 
			Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet 
			service provider or directly to your computer, which can be used to direct internet 
			traffic to you;</li>
			<li>The type of browser and operating system you used;</li>
			<li>The date and time you visited this site; </li>
			<li>The web pages or services you accessed at this site; </li>

			website and from which any web page on this site was linked; and</li>
			<li>If you downloaded a form, the form that was downloaded.</li>

		<p>None of the foregoing information is deemed to constitute personal information.</p>

		<p>This information that is collected automatically is used to improve this website's content 
		and to help OPRHP understand how people are using this website. This information is collected 
		for statistical analysis, to determine what information is of most and of least interest to 
		our visitors, and to identify system performance or problem areas. The information is not 
		collected for commercial marketing purposes and OPRHP does not sell or distribute the 
		information collected from the website for commercial marketing purposes.</p>

		<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
		Cookies are simple text files stored on your web browser to provide a means of distinguishing 
		among users of this website. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet 
		websites. In order to better serve you, we may use "temporary" cookies to enhance, customize 
		or enable your visit to this web site. Temporary cookies do not contain personal information 
		and do not compromise your privacy or security and are erased during the operation of your 
		browser or when your browser is closed.</p>

		<p>During your visit to this website, you may complete a registration form in order to 
		personalize your use of the website. In such an event, we may deliver a "persistent" cookie 
		which would be stored on your computer's hard drive. This persistent cookie will allow the 
		website to recognize you when you visit again and tailor the information presented to you 
		based on your needs and interests. OPRHP uses persistent cookies only with your permission.</p>

		<p>The software you use to access the website allows you to refuse new cookies or delete 
		existing cookies. Refusing or deleting these cookies may limit your ability to take advantage 
		of some of the features of this website.</p>

		<p><b>Information Collected When You Email this Website or Initiate an Online Transaction 
		Through this Website</b><br>
		If during your visit to this website you send an email to OPRHP, your email address and the 
		contents of your email will be collected. The information collected is not limited to text 
		characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us. The 
		information is retained in accordance with the public record retention provisions in the State 
		Arts and Cultural Affairs Law. Your email address and the information contained in your email 
		will be used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve this 
		website, or to forward your email to another agency for appropriate action. Your email address 
		is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and OPRHP does not sell or distribute your 
		email address for any purposes.</p>

		<p>During your visit to this website you may initiate a transaction such as a survey, 
		registration or order form. The information, including personal information, volunteered by 
		you in initiating the transaction is used by OPRHP to operate OPRHP programs, which include 
		the provision of goods, services and information. The information collected by OPRHP may be 
		disclosed by OPRHP for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and 
		terms of the transaction in connection with which the information was submitted by you.</p>

		<p>Currently, OPRHP does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create 
		profiles of children through this website. People are cautioned that the collection of 
		personal information provided by any individual in an email or through an online transaction

		access by federal or State law, be subject to public access. OPRHP encourages parents and 
		teachers to be involved in children's Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever 
		children are asked to provide personal information on-line.</p>

		<p><b>Information and Choice</b><br>
		As noted above, OPRHP does not collect any personal information about you during your visit to 
		this website, unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an e-mail or 
		initiating an online transaction such as a survey, registration, or order form. You may choose 
		not to send us an e-mail, respond to a survey or complete an order form. While your choice not 
		to participate in these activities may limit your ability to receive specific services or 
		products through this website, it will not prevent you from requesting services or products 
		from OPRHP by other means, and will not normally have an impact on your ability to take 
		advantage of other features of the website, including browsing or downloading most publicly 
		available information.</p>

		<p><b>Disclosure of Information Collected Through This Website</b><br>
		The collection of information through this website and the disclosure of that information are 
		subject to the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act. OPRHP will only collect 
		personal information through this website, or disclose such personal information, if the user 
		has consented to the collection and disclosure of such personal information. The voluntary 
		disclosure of personal information to OPRHP by the user, whether solicited or unsolicited, 
		constitutes consent to the collection and disclosure of the information by OPRHP for the 
		purposes for which the user disclosed the information to OPRHP, as was reasonably 
		ascertainable from the nature and terms of the disclosure.</p>

		<p>However, OPRHP may collect or disclose personal information without user consent if the 
		collection or disclosure is: (1) necessary to perform the statutory duties of OPRHP, or 
		necessary for OPRHP to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal 
		statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order or by law; (3) for the purpose of 
		validating the identity of the user; or (4) of information to be used solely for statistical 
		purposes that is in a form that cannot be used to identify any particular person.</p>

		this website is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Law and the Personal 
		Privacy Protection Law. Additionally, OPRHP may disclose personal information to federal or 
		State law enforcement authorities to enforce its rights against unauthorized access or 
		attempted unauthorized access to OPRHP's information technology assets and any other 
		inappropriate use of its website.</p>

		records retention and disposition requirements of the New York State Arts and Cultural Affairs 
		Law. Information on the requirements of the Arts and Cultural Affairs Law may be found at

		In general, the Internet services logs of OPRHP, comprising electronic files or automated logs 
		created to monitor access and use of state agency services provided through this website, are 
		retained for one year and then destroyed. Information, including personal information that you

		information pertaining to that user has been collected through this website. Any such request

		state agency website, and that information is to be provided to the user pursuant to the 
		user's request, the privacy compliance officer shall inform the user of his or her right to 
		request that the personal information be amended or corrected under the procedures set forth

		duties. Employees who have access to this information are required to follow appropriate
