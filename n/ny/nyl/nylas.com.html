This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p><p></p><p><b><i>What personal information does company collect?</i></b></p><p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p><p></p><p><b>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</b></p><p>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include your full name, email address, phone number, credit card and/or other payment information, username, password and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, notifying you of product updates, and communicating with you about Company's products and services, including specials and new features. In addition, the Company may have access to personal information contained in your e-mail communications if the Company needs to access your account to perform maintenance or debug technical issues.</p><p></p><p><b>Other Information Collected Automatically:</b></p><ul><li>We receive and store certain other types of information that are not Personal Information whenever you interact with the Services. For example, Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, browser information, cookie information, and the page you requested.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our website and software applications and its components or the frequency with which users use the Services to interact with third-party sites and services. Company only uses this data in aggregate or anonymous form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. In some cases, anonymous information may need to be sent to third parties in order to use some features of the Services, such as web forgery protection or web searches. This type of aggregate or anonymous data also enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Services so that we can make the Services appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate or anonymous information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Services. We share this type of data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online and app experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate or anonymous information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</li></ul>

We use cookies to enhance visitors' experiences, to learn more about their use of the Services and to improve quality.&nbsp;</li>
