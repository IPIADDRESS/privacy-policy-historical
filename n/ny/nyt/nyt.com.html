<p>The New York Times on the Web has adopted a set of information management guidelines which serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established.

However, we will never share your billing and credit card information, which NYTimes.com collects and stores to enable the purchase of these products.  This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments. 
</p><p><b>Contests, Surveys, Special Offers</b>: On occasion, The New York Times on the Web also collects additional personal information from subscribers in connection with optional contests, surveys, or special offers.

<b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</b>: 
We use a proprietary advertising serving system to display ads on our
site. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third party
advertising companies to serve ads onto our website, and in these
instances may use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags) to help better manage advertising on our
site.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's
server about the online movements of Web users. For instance,
advertisers may place  a clear gif allowing them to recognize an
existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. The main
difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are
invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the
period at the end of this sentence.  Please keep in mind we do not
have access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor
additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser. Please <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/privacyinformation2.html">click here</a> to see 
a list of these advertising agencies and their privacy policies.
