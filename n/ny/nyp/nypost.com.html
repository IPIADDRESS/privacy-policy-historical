				<em>Effective as of June 21, 2006</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>NYP Holdings, Inc. ("The Post")</strong>
				, which includes The New York Post, NYPOST.COM,
				NYPOSTSTORE.COM, STORE.NYPOST.COM and other Internet
				sites controlled by The Post (
				<strong>"Post Sites"</strong>
				), is part of the News America Group, which has adopted
				a set of
				<a style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html">
					Privacy Principles
				</a>
				applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. The Post has
				implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy,
				which describes how we collect, use and share personally
				identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and
				about individuals located in the U.S.
			</p>
			<p>
				From time to time The Post may revise this Privacy
				Policy to reflect changes in the law, technology,
				industry initiatives, the features of the Post Sites or
				off-line data collection practices. If we make revisions
				that change the way we collect or use your PII, those
				changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the
				effective date will be noted at the beginning of the
				Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so
				that you are up to date on our most current policies and
				practices. If the Post materially changes its practices
				regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will
				continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was
				collected unless you have been provided notice of and
				have not objected to the change.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>COLLECTION:</strong>
				COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
				("PII") BY THE POST
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>GENERAL</strong>
				. The Post collects personally identifiable information
				("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name,
				email address, mailing address or telephone number) in
				order to create or enhance our relationship with you.
				For example, The Post collects PII from you when you
				register for full access to Post Sites. Users who have
				supplied Post Sites with PII in the past (for example,
				by entering a contest or sweepstakes, signing up for
				home delivery of the Print Edition, or registering for
				our Daily Newsletter) will also be required to complete
				the registration process. You can register for full
				access to Post Sites
				<a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="/Signup">
					here
				</a>
				. We also collect PII when you participate in activities
				on Post Sites such as sweepstakes, contests, surveys,
				forums, bulletin boards, polls, e-mailing to a friend
				and subscription registrations; when you submit
				comments, content or suggestions to us; or when you want
				us to furnish you with products, services or
				information. We may also obtain PII from reputable third
				parties.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>COOKIES</strong>
				. Cookies are small bits of information that Post Sites
				place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies
				remember information about your activities on our sites
				and enable The Post to make your visits to Post Sites
				more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your name
				and password for easy logon to a site you have
				previously visited, can keep track of whether or not you
				have voted in an online poll, can save information
				concerning the sections and/or stories you visit the
				most or can track the items you have placed in your
				"shopping cart" during a visit to our online store.
				Information about your activities on Post Sites and
				other non-personally identifiable information about you
				may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter
				to those we believe are consistent with your interests.
			</p>
			<p>
				Third party advertisements displayed on Post Sites may
				also contain cookies set by Internet advertising
				companies or advertisers (See "Notice" below). The Post
				does not control these cookies and visitors to Post
				Sites should check the privacy policy of the Internet
				advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how
				it uses cookies.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Post may use cookies and similar tools to relate
				your use of Post Sites to PII obtained from you or a
				reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us
				to send you information about our upcoming products or
				promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your
				activities on Post Sites can allow us to limit the
				materials we send you to items we know you will find
				interesting, based on your prior online activities and
				preferences. However, if The Post wishes to combine
				personal and cookie or click stream information in this
				manner, we will obtain your express prior consent.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can program your computer to warn you each time a
				cookie is being set or to refuse cookies completely.
				However, without cookies you won't have access to most
				features of the Post Sites, such as our stories, our
				email newsletter, voting in polls, shopping in the
				online store, purchasing home delivery or using the
				customized features of our online searchable real estate
				listings database.

				<strong>NOTICE:</strong>
				THE POST WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII
				COLLECTION PRACTICES
			</p>
			<p>
				When The Post collects PII from you, we will make sure
				you are informed about who is collecting the
				information, how and why the information is being
				collected and the types of uses we will make of the
				information.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the time your PII is collected, The Post will notify
				you of your options regarding our use of your personally
				identifiable information, including whether we can share
				it with outside companies (See "Choice" below). This
				Policy describes the types of other companies that may
				want to send you information about their products and
				services and therefore want to share your personal
				information, provided you have given The Post permission
				to do so (See "Use" below).
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information
				from consumers in manual format, such as a post card,
				in-paper contest, or subscription form. Providing
				detailed notice in those situations often proves
				impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with
				a short notice that describes how to obtain the full
				text of this Policy and other relevant information from
				us.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Post Sites may be linked to Internet sites operated
				by other companies. Some of these third party sites may
				be co-branded with a NYPOST.COM logo, even though they
				are not operated or maintained by The Post (for example,
				special sections appearing online are hosted and
				maintained by another company). The Post Sites also
				carry advertisements from other companies. Although we
				choose our business partners and advertisers carefully,
				The Post is not responsible for the privacy practices of
				web sites operated by third parties that are linked to
				Post Sites or for the privacy practices of third party
				or national Internet advertising companies. Once you've
				left a Post Site via such a link or by clicking on an
				advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy
				policy of the third party or advertiser site to
				determine how they will handle any PII they collect from
				you.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Post Sites may also be linked to sites operated by
				companies affiliated with The Post (i.e., that are part
				of the News America Group). Visitors to those affiliated
				sites should still refer to their separate privacy
				policies and practices, which may differ in some
				respects from this Policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of the advertisements that appear on Post Sites are
				delivered to you by national Internet advertising
				companies such as DoubleClick, Atlas DMT and 24/7 Real
				Media. These companies utilize certain technologies to
				deliver and select advertisements and marketing messages
				based upon anonymous information their technologies
				collect about your visit to Post Sites, including
				information about the banner ads they display, their
				cookie and your IP address. To opt out of information
				collection by these companies, or to obtain information
				about the technologies they use or their own privacy
				policies, please visit their websites at:

				<strong>CHOICE:</strong>
				THE POST WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF
				YOUR PII
			</p>
			<p>
				The Post will not use the PII we collect from you for
				purposes different from the purpose for which it was
				submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are
				not affiliated with The Post, unless we obtain your
				consent.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>USE:</strong>
				THE POST'S USE OF PII
			</p>
			<p>
				The Post will use your PII in a manner that is
				consistent with this Policy. If The Post obtains PII
				from a third party, such as a business partner, our use
				of that information is governed by this Policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Post may share your PII with companies that are
				affiliated with us, that is, part of the News America
				Group of companies. Provided you have given us
				permission, The Post may also share your PII with
				advertisers and business partners that are not part of
				the News America Group of companies, but would like to
				send you information about their products and services.
				For example, we may offer promotions, contests, or
				sweepstakes in conjunction with a business partner with
				whom we may share your PII. When we do this, there will
				be a link to the partner's privacy policy when PII is
				collected. Moreover, we will never share your credit
				card information with third parties except those The
				Post uses to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment
				and payment processing) required to complete purchases
				you make through Post Sites.
			</p>
			<p>
				Post employees, agents and contractors must have a
				legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII.
				The Post may share your PII with outside contractors or
				agents who help us manage our information activities
				(i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment,
				statistical analyses), but they may only use your PII to
				provide The Post with a specific service and not for any
				other purpose.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Post may also enter into agreements with outside
				companies that possess the technology that allows The
				Post to customize the advertising and marketing messages
				you receive on Post Sites. Your non-PII and click stream
				data about your activities on Post Sites may be shared
				with these companies so this customization can be
				accomplished. These companies will not share your
				information with any third party or use it for any other
				purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic
				information may also be shared with The Post's
				advertisers and business partners.
			</p>
			<p>
				There may be instances when The Post may disclose PII
				without providing you with a choice in order to protect
				the legal rights of The Post, other companies within the
				News America Group or their employees, agents and
				contractors; to protect the safety and security of
				visitors to Post Sites; to protect against fraud or for
				risk management purposes; or comply with the law or
				legal process. In addition, if The Post sells all or
				part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of
				assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business
				transfer, The Post may transfer your PII to a third
				party as part of that transaction.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>SECURITY:</strong>
				THE POST PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII
			</p>
			<p>
				The Post uses reasonable administrative, technical,
				personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its
				possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use,
				disclosure or modification. In addition, The Post uses
				reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate,
				up-to-date and appropriately complete. Passwords stored
				by The Post are encrypted both in transit and when
				stored within The Post's online databases.
