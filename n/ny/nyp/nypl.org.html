<p><img src="images/privacy.gif" border="0" alt="Privacy Policy"><br>
</p>
<p>The Library is committed to protecting the privacy
of our users, customers, members, donors, and friends. We
believe that maintaining our patrons' privacy
is important, and we have created this Privacy Policy
so that our patrons can learn what the Library does
with information it may obtain about its patrons. By
using the Library's services, including its website,
and by communicating with the Library, you agree to
be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. <br>
<br>
<strong>Type of Information Collected</strong><br>
In general, the Library does not collect personally
identifiable information about individuals—such
as names and postal or e-mail addresses—except
when such information is voluntarily provided by the
patron. Personally identifiable information is
obtained from online transactions such as purchases,
registrations, or contributions. Additionally,
personally identifiable information may be obtained
in connection with other activities, services, or resources
made available on our website, in person at one of
our facilities, or (as set forth in the following sentence)
through e-mails sent by us to our patrons. In
order to help us to better tailor our services and
offerings, the Library collects limited information
about patron click-throughs, solely in connection with <em>The
New York Public Library News</em> e-newsletter and
the Membership Department's e-mail communications.</p>
<p>Like many websites, the Library's website also automatically
  logs certain aggregate information about visits to
  our website.  This information is used for
  system administration and for producing usage statistics.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Use of Your Information</strong><br>
  Unless the Library explicitly states otherwise and
  except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, any personally
  identifiable information provided to the Library
  is maintained by and accessible only to the Library.
  Except as set forth herein (or as required by law
  or as necessary for the proper operation of the Library),
  we will not release personally identifiable information
  about our patrons, including their use of Library
  materials and resources (whether electronic or in
  print, including, but not limited to, circulation
  records and specific internet or website resources).</p>
<p>The Library compiles aggregate demographic data
  related to our patrons to better manage our services
  and to provide aggregate information to potential
  funders of the Library's programs. The
  Library may also use personally identifiable information
  you submit to inform you of Library programs, services,
  and activities, including exhibitions, events, programs,
  and membership opportunities. The Library does
  not share or exchange email addresses with other
  organizations. The Library does not rent or sell
  its donor mailing list but may sometimes exchange
  names and addresses with other organizations. You
  may indicate to the Library at any time whether or
  not you wish to have the Library share your name
  with other organizations. When <a href="https://www2.nypl.org/support/secure/">making
  online donations</a>, donors may indicate preferences
  for information sharing. Donors may also contact
  the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/pr/contacts.cfm#friends">Development
  Office</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Updating Your Information</strong> <br>
  Patrons
    who would like to update information and preferences
    in connection with  Library newsletters, mailing
    lists, and databases should refer to this list
    for <a href="contact.cfm">contact information</a>. In all instances, patrons
    can stop receiving e-newsletters sent by the Library
    by clicking on the  “Unsubscribe” link
    at the bottom of each such e-newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Partners</strong><br>
  The Library has teamed up with reputable third-party
    partners in order to provide certain services to
    its patrons. The information you submit
    to the Library may be provided to those third parties
    on a confidential basis so that they can assist
    us in providing certain services, including English
    Classes for Speakers of Other Languages and activities
    that require us to maintain databases and/or process
    credit card transactions and donations. In
    cases where patrons leave the Library's website
    to visit one of its partners' websites, patrons
    are encouraged to become familiar with the privacy
    policies of the websites they visit.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Security</strong><br>
  The Library has reasonable physical, electronic,
  and managerial measures in place to prevent unauthorized
  access to the information we collect. We do
  not, however, claim any responsibility for information
  collected by or from websites linking to or from
  the Library's website.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your
  browser from a website and stored on your computer's
  hard drive.  Cookies cannot read data from
  your hard disk or read cookie files that were created
  by other websites—the website that creates
  a cookie is the only one that a browser will permit
  to access it.  Examples of ways in which the
  Library might use cookies would be to customize content
  areas or to analyze site activity.<br>
  <br>
  If you are concerned about the use of cookies, the
  Library suggests that you explore your browser's
  options to notify you whenever a cookie is set, or
  to disallow cookies altogether. Patrons should
  be aware, however, that prohibiting the use of cookies
  may restrict the patron's access to certain types
  of content or features. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Children</strong><br>
  Parents should remind their children to ask their
  permission before providing personal information
  to any website or purchasing any products or services
  online. The Library urges all parents to participate
  in their children's exploration of the internet and
  to teach them about protecting their personal information
  while online. For further information, see <a href="http://www.nypl.org/legal/safety.cfm">A
  Safety Net for the Internet: A Parent's Guide</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Policy Changes</strong><br>
  This Privacy Policy may be revised to reflect changes
    in the Library's policies and practices or to reflect
    new services and content provided by the Library. Patrons
    are encouraged to check this document periodically
    to stay informed of the Library's current
    privacy guidelines. <br>
