<p>New York Press may use your user name and password to grant you access to and use of the Website.

<p>We also allow access to Our database by third parties that provide Us with services such as technical maintenance, forums and coupon software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. If you choose to purchase items through features on the Website, We may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. You may provide information about yourself to Us in areas of the Website that are managed or participated in by third parties, such as job boards or shopping areas. In such cases, the information provided may be used by Us and by such third parties, each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to Our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While We will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, We do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. We may also provide access to Our database in order to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings, for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders or other legal process.</p>
<p>In addition, We reserve the right to use the information We collect about your computer, which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with Our servers, to gather broad demographic information and to otherwise administer the Website.</p>
<p>While your personally identifying information is protected as outlined above, We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell and share data about Our users for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.</p>

The use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their privacy policies, not Ours, and We disclaim all liability in connection therewith.</p>
