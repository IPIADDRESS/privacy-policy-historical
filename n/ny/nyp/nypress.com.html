<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>We are committed to protecting  consumer privacy online. &nbsp;The purpose of our policy is to inform you about  the types of information we gather about you when you visit strausnews.com or  any of its sister sites, which include but are not limited to  advertisernewsnorth.com, advertisernewssouth.com, spartaindependent.com,  townshipjournal.com, warwickadvertiser.com, thephoto-news.com,  chroniclenewspaper.com, westmilfordmessenger.com, pikecountycourier.com,  nypress.com, ourtownny.com, westsidespirit.com, otdowntown.com, chelseaclintonnews.com,  and dirt-mag.com (collectively, the “Straus News Sites”).&nbsp; The policy also describes  how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the  choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, that  information.</p>
<p><strong><u>How You Accept This Policy</u></strong><br>
  By visiting any of the Straus News Sites, or by otherwise providing us with  personally identifiable information (such as an email address), you agree to  the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong><u>How We Gather Information from  Users</u></strong><br>
  How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the  activities in which you elect to participate, and the services provided.  &nbsp;You can visit some pages on the Straus News Sites without affirmatively  providing any information. &nbsp;Other pages may prompt you to provide  information, such as when you submit a press release, business milestone,  letter to the editor, or a photo to a Straus News Site. You may also provide  information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, voting and  polling activities, photo galleries, message boards, and other areas of the  Straus News Sites.<br>
  When you submit any of the above  information, we may collect personal information (“PI”), such your first name  and last name, address, or email address, which you choose to provide to  us.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We may collect PI if you contact us or otherwise give it  to us (e.g., in an email).</p>
<p>  Like most websites, we also collect  information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may not  be transparent to our visitors. We may collect information about the computer,  mobile telephone, smart phone, tablet computer, or other device you use to  access Straus News.&nbsp; For example, we may log the name of your Internet  Service Provider or use “cookie” technology. Among other things, the cookie may  store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that  information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you  encounter a particular advertisement while visiting the Site. &nbsp;As we adopt  additional technology, we may also gather information through other means.  &nbsp;In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for  example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may  inhibit the Straus News Sites’ functionality.</p>
<p><strong><u>What We Do With The Non-Personally  Identifiable Information We Collect</u></strong><br>
  We may use information that is not personally identifiable to enhance the  visitor experience of the Straus News Sites, to operate and maintain the Straus  News Sites, to investigate and understand how the Straus News Sites are used, to  monitor and protect the security and integrity of the Straus News Sites, and to  analyze our business.&nbsp; As one example, we may combine information about  your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to learn  which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive.  &nbsp;Aggregated information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers  and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually.</p>
<p><strong><u>How We Use And Disclose PI</u></strong><br>
  We may use PI to email you or to otherwise communicate with you about  activities relating to the Straus News Sites and our business, including  marketing and promotion.&nbsp; You can opt out of receiving future promotional  and advertising related emails and electronic communications by following the unsubscribe  link in any such emails.</p>
<p>  We may use PI to enhance the  visitor experience of the Straus News Sites, to operate and maintain the Straus  News Sites, to investigate and understand how our Service are used, to analyze  our business, and to monitor and protect the security and integrity of the  Straus New Sites.</p>
<p>  We may disclose PI as required by  law or in response to service of legal process, such as a court order, summons,  subpoena, or the like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  We may share PI with trusted  partners who provide services related to the Straus News Sites (such as website  hosting).&nbsp; These trusted partners do not have the right to use this PI for  any purpose other than those related to the Straus New Sites.<br>
  Information about our users,  including PI, may be disclosed or transferred to entities now or in the future  affiliated with us or as part of any merger, acquisition, change of control,  debt financing, insolvency, bankruptcy or sale of our assets, and may be used  in the businesses of any entity so receiving it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  Although we do not do so now, we  may aggregate your PI with that of other users and sell it to third parties. </p>
<p><strong><u>What Information We Do Not Collect</u></strong><br>
  When you share or recommend articles or content from any Straus News Site on  Facebook, Twitter, or any other third-party social media platform, that action  is governed by the third-party site’s respective privacy policy.&nbsp; We do  not track or store a record of those comments or actions, and you should take  care to review the third-party’s privacy policy before sharing any such  content.</p>
<p>  Moreover, Straus News does not  knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about  children under the age of 13.&nbsp; If we discover we have received any  information from a child under the age of 13 in violation of this policy, we  will delete that information immediately. If you believe, the Straus News Sites  have any information from or about anyone under the age of 13, please contact  us at webmanager@strausnews.com. &nbsp;Children under the age of 13 are  specifically prohibited from registering as Members of strausnews.com.</p>
<p><strong><u>Affiliated Sites, Linked Sites And  Advertisements</u></strong><br>
  Straus News expects its partners, advertisers, and third-party affiliates to  respect the privacy of our users.&nbsp; However, third parties, including our  partners, advertisers, affiliates, and other content providers accessible  through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and  practices.&nbsp; For example, during your visit to the Straus News Sites you  may follow a link to, or view as part of a frame on a Straus News Site, certain  content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.&nbsp; Also,  through the Straus News Sites you may be introduced to, or be able to access,  information, websites, advertisements, features, contests, or sweepstakes  offered by other parties.&nbsp; Straus News is not responsible for the actions  or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>  While on our site, our advertisers,  promotional partners, or other third parties may use cookies or other  technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve  information about you.&nbsp; For example, some of our advertising may be served  by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to  determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.&nbsp; Through  features available on our site, third parties may use cookies or other  technology to gather information.&nbsp; Straus News does not control the use of  this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any  actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>  Please be careful and responsible  whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose personally  identifiable information in public areas on the Site, such as in message  boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that information can  be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our  knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or  third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Strausnews.com and  this policy.</p>
<p><strong><u>How Do I Opt-Out or Correct  Information About Me</u></strong><br>
  You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages and newsletters from  Straus News.&nbsp; We provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving  communications from us at the point where we request information about  you.&nbsp; To do so, you can send us a message at webmanager@strausnews.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Data Security</u></strong><br>
  We do our best to preserve the integrity and security of your PI.&nbsp; We  cannot, however, ensure the security of any information you transmit to the  Service, and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; Depending on where you live, you  may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing or by  emailing us at webmanager@strausnews.com.</p>
<p><strong><u>International Visitors</u></strong><br>
  This Service is hosted in the United States.&nbsp; If you are an international  visitor, you should note that by providing your PI, you are:&nbsp; (i)  permitting the transfer of your PI to the United States which may not have the  same data protection laws as the country in which you reside; and (ii)  permitting the use of your PI in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong><u>Changes to this policy</u></strong><br>
  If we make any changes to this policy, we will post such changes on this  page.&nbsp; Such changes shall become effective immediately upon posting and,  unless provided otherwise, will not apply retroactively.&nbsp; If we make any  material changes and you have provided us with an e-mail address, we will do  our best to notify you of any such changes.&nbsp;</p>
