							<div class="clearA"></div><div class="sectionTitle">If You Send Us Personal Information</div>
								<div class="clearA"></div><div class="mainText"><p>If you choose to provide us with personal information -- as in an e-mail to Governor or someone else, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it to us through our web site -- we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We may share the information you give us with another State of New Jersey government agency, department, office or entity, or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information you provide or to give it to any private organizations. The State of New Jersey does not collect information for commercial marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Section B. Personal Information and Choice</strong><br><br>You may choose whether to provide personal information on-line.</p>
<p>"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet protocol address is not considered personal information.</p>
<p>We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us email, participating in a survey or completing an on-line form. You may choose not to contact us by email, participate in a survey, or provide any personal information using an online form.

								<div class="clearA"></div><div class="mainText"><p>Email is not a secure medium. Personal information sent via the Internet can be intercepted.

							<div class="clearA"></div><div class="sectionTitle">Kids' Page</div>
								<div class="clearA"></div><div class="mainText"><p>We at the State of New Jersey are especially concerned about protecting children's privacy. We hope parents and teachers are involved in children's Internet explorations. It is particularly important for parents to guide their children when children are asked to provide personal information on line. The State of New Jersey homepage for kids encourages children to send email messages with their feedback and suggestions. We specifically ask children to get their parents' permission before providing any information on line -- at our site or any other site -- and hope parents will always be involved in those decisions. Most importantly, when children do provide information through the State of New Jersey web site, it is only used to enable us to respond to the writer, and not to create profiles of children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div>
							<div class="clearA"></div><div class="sectionTitle">Section C. Public Access to Information</div>
								<div class="clearA"></div><div class="mainText"><p>In the State of New Jersey, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.</p>
<p>All the information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div>
