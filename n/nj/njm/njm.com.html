<ul id="content_list_no">

<a name="bookmark2" id="bookmark2"></a><h2>Notice of Information Practices</h2>
                    <p class="content-nowrap">Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (1982) and N.J.S.A. 17:23A-1 et seq.</p>
                    <p>The information you provide to us is important. We review it in our evaluation of your request for coverage and in determining rates. It may not be the only information about you or persons to be insured under your policy that we consider. In accord with the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and New Jersey's insurance information privacy law, we would like to briefly describe our practices as they relate to information gathered in connection with insurance transactions.</p>
                    <p>We may need additional information from you or other individuals proposed for coverage. Motor vehicle records, court records or other public records might be reviewed. A photo of any property to be insured might be taken. We also might obtain information from third parties, such as other insurance companies or a consumer reporting agency. A consumer report from such an agency may contain information as to credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, hobbies, occupation, personal characteristics or mode of living. An investigative consumer report containing the same type of information may be obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, associates, acquaintances, or others who may have knowledge concerning those items of information.</p>
                    <p>If coverage is declined or the charge for coverage is increased either wholly or partly because of information contained in a consumer report, we will tell you. We also will give you the name and address of the consumer reporting agency making the report.</p>
                  <p>It is possible that an investigative consumer report may be made. Within a reasonable time after receiving this notice of our information practices, you have the right to file a written request for and promptly receive a written disclosure as to the nature and scope of the investigation. You also will have the right to ask to be personally interviewed. Information you give during the interview will be included in the report sent to us. Upon written request and identification, you have the right to receive a copy of your investigative consumer report. Information about you gathered by the agency in making a consumer report or investigative consumer report may be kept by the agency and provided to others to the extent allowed by law.</p>
                    <p>Information about you in our records may be kept and may be referred to for purposes relating to the issuance and servicing of coverage and settling claims. We will not disclose information about you to others without your written consent unless the disclosure is necessary to conduct our business. The law permits us to share information about you without your prior consent under certain circumstances. Examples of these include disclosures to:<br>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Parties who perform a business, professional or insurance function for our company, including companies from which we purchase reinsurance coverage;</li>
                      <li>Adjusters, appraisers, investigators and attorneys who need the information to investigate, defend or settle a claim involving you;</li>

                      <li>Businesses that conduct scientific research, including actuarial or underwriting studies;</li>
