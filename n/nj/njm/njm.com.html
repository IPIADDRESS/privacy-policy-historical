                    <p class="content-nowrap">NJM Insurance Group (made up of New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company, New Jersey Re-Insurance Company, New Jersey Indemnity Insurance Company and New Jersey Casualty Insurance Company) recognizes that a fundamental component of the insurer/insured relationship is a customer's trust that the insurer will respect the privacy and confidentiality of the customer's financial information and all aspects of the customer's insurance relationship. NJM Insurance Group is committed to keeping your information secure and confidential.</p>
                    <p class="content-nowrap">NJM Insurance Group has established the following policy to achieve this purpose.</p>
                    <ul id="content_list_no">
                      <li>NJM Insurance Group shall recognize each customer's expectations of privacy by safeguarding information that you share with us. This commitment to privacy will be maintained regardless of whether information is received by mail, telephone, Internet or in person. </li>
                      <li>Information shall be collected and utilized only to the extent necessary to deliver insurance service to you and to offer products, services and other opportunities that may be of interest to you. </li>
                      <li>NJM Insurance Group is dedicated to maintaining accurate customer records and shall strive to correct any inaccurate information in a timely manner. You may notify us toll-free at 1-800-232-6600 or by mail to correct any information.</li>
                      <li>NJM Insurance Group limits access to your personal information to only those insurance company employees with a business reason for knowing such information. NJM Insurance Group educates all employees about the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy and has established policies on the proper use of customer information. </li>
                      <li>If NJM Insurance Group utilizes other organizations to support its business, it will require them to abide by this privacy policy statement. </li>
                      <li>NJM Insurance Group does not sell customer lists or financial information about its customers to any third-party vendors. NJM Insurance Group may, however, allow select customer information to be shared with its affiliated company, NJM Bank FSB, under controlled conditions for the purpose of designing and marketing NJM Bank FSB products or NJM Bank-sponsored products. NJM Bank FSB has adopted a similar privacy policy to safeguard any personal customer information. </li>
                      <li>NJM Insurance Group will provide you a choice as to whether your personal customer information should be shared with other organizations even for the limited purposes described above before your information is released to another organization for marketing purposes.</li>
                      <li>In order to conduct the business of insurance, customer information in our records is referenced relating to the issuance and servicing of coverage and settling claims. NJM Insurance Group conducts these insurance operations in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and New Jersey's insurance information privacy law as explained in our Notice of Information Practices.</li>
                      <li>This privacy policy will apply to both current and former customers of NJM Insurance Group.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="content-nowrap">The goal of this privacy policy is to promote and maintain a commitment to privacy by NJM Insurance Group in its use of customer information. NJM Insurance Group reserves the right to update and modify this statement at any time and will post changes on its Web site. NJM Insurance Group will continue to monitor itself for compliance of its procedures to protect customer privacy.</p>
                    <p class="content-nowrap"><a name="bookmark2" id="bookmark2"></a><span class="subheading2">Notice of Information Practices</span></p>
                    <p class="content-nowrap">Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (1982) and N.J.S.A. 17:23A-1 et seq.</p>
                    <p class="content-nowrap">The information you provide to us is important. We review it in our evaluation of your request for coverage and in determining rates. It may not be the only information about you or persons to be insured under your policy that we consider. In accord with the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and New Jersey's insurance information privacy law, we would like to briefly describe our practices as they relate to information gathered in connection with insurance transactions.</p>
                    <p class="content-nowrap">We may need additional information from you or other individuals proposed for coverage. Motor vehicle records, court records or other public records might be reviewed. A photo of any property to be insured might be taken. We also might obtain information from third parties, such as other insurance companies or a consumer reporting agency. A consumer report from such an agency may contain information as to credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, hobbies, occupation, personal characteristics or mode of living. An investigative consumer report containing the same type of information may be obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, associates, acquaintances, or others who may have knowledge concerning those items of information.</p>
                    <p class="content-nowrap">If coverage is declined or the charge for coverage is increased either wholly or partly because of information contained in a consumer report, we will tell you. We also will give you the name and address of the consumer reporting agency making the report.</p>
                    <p class="content-nowrap">It is possible that an investigative consumer report may be made. Within a reasonable time after receiving this notice of our information practices, you have the right to file a written request for and promptly receive a written disclosure as to the nature and scope of the investigation. You also will have the right to ask to be personally interviewed. Information you give during the interview will be included in the report sent to us. Upon written request and identification, you have the right to receive a copy of your investigative consumer report. Information about you gathered by the agency in making a consumer report or investigative consumer report may be kept by the agency and provided to others to the extent allowed by law.</p>
                    <p class="content-nowrap">Information about you in our records may be kept and may be referred to for purposes relating to the issuance and servicing of coverage and settling claims. We will not disclose information about you to others without your written consent unless the disclosure is necessary to conduct our business. The law permits us to share information about you without your prior consent under certain circumstances. Examples of these include disclosures to:</p>
                    <ol id="content_list">
                      <li>parties who perform a business, professional or insurance function for our company, including companies from which we purchase reinsurance coverage; </li>
                      <li>adjusters, appraisers, investigators and attorneys who need the information to investigate, defend or settle a claim involving you; </li>
                      <li>businesses that help us with data processing or marketing;</li>
                      <li>businesses that conduct scientific research, including actuarial or underwriting studies; </li>
