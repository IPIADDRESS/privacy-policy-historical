Motor vehicle records, court records or other public records might be reviewed. A photo of any property to be insured might be taken. We also might obtain information from third parties, such as other insurance companies or a consumer reporting agency. A consumer report from such an agency may contain information as to credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, hobbies, occupation, personal characteristics or mode of living. An investigative consumer report containing the same type of information may be obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, associates, acquaintances, or others who may have knowledge concerning those items of information.</p>

We also will give you the name and address of the consumer reporting agency making the report.</p>

Within a reasonable time after receiving this notice of our information practices, you have the right to file a written request for and promptly receive a written disclosure as to the nature and scope of the investigation. You also will have the right to ask to be personally interviewed. Information you give during the interview will be included in the report sent to us.

Information about you gathered by the agency in making a consumer report or investigative consumer report may be kept by the agency and provided to others to the extent allowed by law.</p>
