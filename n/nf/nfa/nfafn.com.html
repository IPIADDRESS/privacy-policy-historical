<p>Welcome to FixandFlipNetwork.com, an interactive online community operated by National Fix and Flip Network, Inc. (herein known as "<strong class="western">us</strong>", "<strong class="western">we</strong>", or "<strong class="western">our</strong>"). This "Privacy Policy" applies to this site (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise (collectively, "<strong class="western">Computer</strong>")) and other interactive features, applications or downloads that are operated by us that are available through this site or that interact with this site and post this Privacy Policy (collectively, "<strong class="western">Website</strong>"). Further, this Privacy Policy does not apply to our collection of information from other sources (unless specifically stated).</p>
<p>We have adopted this Privacy Policy to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy, together with the <b>Terms &amp; Conditions</b> posted on our Website, sets forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We keep this Privacy Policy posted on our Website and you should review it frequently, as we reserve the right to change it from time to time without prior notice to you. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. National Fix and Flip Network will not use your personally identifiable information, however, in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected without your consent.</p>
<p>WHEN YOU ACCESS OUR WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE.</p>
<p><strong class="western">A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>Our Website typically collects two (2) kinds of information about you: (a) information that you provide that personally identifies you; and (b) information that does not personally identify you, that we automatically collect when you visit our Website or that you provide us.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Personally 	Identifiable Information:</b></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our definition of personally identifiable information includes any information that may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, mail address, phone number, etc. We do not require you to provide us with your personal information but since the National Fix and Flip Website is an interactive community, we encourage you to sign up as a Member to enjoy the full extent of our features and services. Detailed requirements about personal information as a Member can be found in our “Membership Agreement”.</p>
<p>In certain other circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you an opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information in connection with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect of our Website. For instance, you may: (a) provide your name, mail/shipping address, e-mail address, credit card number and phone number when registering with our Website, using areas of our online store or in connection with a contest entry; (b) provide certain demographic information about you (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference, usage frequency, etc.) when participating in a survey, poll or joining a club; or (c) provide us with your contact preferences when signing up to receive our special offers or newsletters. Whether or not you provide this information is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit we may offer or gain access to certain content on our Website.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><b>Non-Personal 	Information:</b></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our definition of non-personal information is any information that does not personally identify you. Non-personal information can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We obtain non-personal information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your personally identifiable information. We also automatically collect certain non-personal information from you when you access our Website.</p>
<p><strong class="western">B. HOW WE USE &amp; SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Personally 	Identifiable Information:</p>
</li>
</ol><ol>
<li><ol>
<li>
<p>The 		personally identifiable information you submit to us as a Member is 		used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better 		serve you or in other ways naturally associated with the 		circumstances in which you provided the information. We may also 		use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, 		such as customer service, to provide you with information or 		services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed 		to receive, to provide you with marketing or promotional 		information for our products or those of our partner companies, 		subsidiaries or other affiliated companies ("<strong class="western">affiliated 		companies</strong>"), to 		communicate with you about content or other information you have 		posted or shared with us via our Website or with regard to your use 		of the Website and, in our discretion, changes to the Website 		and/or Website policies, for internal business purposes, or for 		purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as 		otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. You may opt-out from 		receiving future promotional information from us or our affiliated 		companies, or direct that we not share your information with any 		affiliated companies, as set forth below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 		certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable 		information with our third-party vendors performing functions on 		our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies) – e.g., 		vendors that process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, 		administer our promotions, provide us marketing or promotional 		assistance, analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc. 		Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information 		with them, only to carry out our requests. In addition, we may 		share your personally identifiable information with participating 		sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) 		you enter via our Website, and with third parties who assist us in 		using the content or other information you have posted or shared 		with us via our Website (e.g., production companies we may use). 		Further, we may share your personally identifiable information with 		third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with 		whom we have marketing or other relationships.

<p>Non-Personal 	Information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In 		addition to any personally identifiable information or other 		information that you choose to provide to us on the Website, we and 		our third-party service providers may use a variety of 		technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically collect 		certain web site usage information whenever you visit or interact 		with the Website. This information may include browser type, 		operating system, the page served, the time, the source of the 		request, the preceding page view, and other similar information. We 		may use this usage information for a variety of purposes, including 		to enhance or otherwise improve the Website. In addition, we may 		also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for 		the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable 		(collectively, referred to herein as a "<strong class="western">Device 		Identifier</strong>"). A Device 		Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your 		Computer, and we may identify your device by its Device Identifier. 		When analyzed, usage information helps us determine how our Website 		is used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the Website, what 		type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find 		most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in 		particular kinds of content and advertising. We may associate your 		Device Identifier or web site usage information with the personally 		identifiable information you provide, but we will treat the 		combined information as personally identifiable information. Web 		site usage information may be collected using various methods, such 		as the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Web 	Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called 	web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear 	GIFs") may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages. 	Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or 	other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can 	act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used 	for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count 	visitors to the Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, 	to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to 	count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cookies. 	A cookie is a data file placed on a Computer when it is used to 	visit the Website. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, 	without limitation, tracking user preferences and web pages visited 	while using the Website. You may disable cookies using your 	browser's preferences, but some features of the Website may not 	function properly or may operate slowly if you disable the cookies. 	If you are concerned about the storage and use of cookies, you may 	be able to direct your internet browser to notify you and seek 	approval whenever a cookie is being sent to your hard drive. You may 	also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive through your 	internet browser or other programs. Please note, however, that some 	parts of our Website will not function properly or be available to 	you if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable the 	acceptance of cookies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobile 	Device Identifiers. Certain mobile service providers uniquely 	identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers 	may receive such device information if you access the Website 	through mobile devices. Certain features of our Website may require 	collection of mobile phone numbers, and we may associate that phone 	number to mobile device identification information. Additionally, 	some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint 	the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending 	on the provider, we or our third-party service providers may receive 	this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embedded 	Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to 	collect information about your interactions with the Website, such 	as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto 	your Computer from our web server or a third-party service provider, 	is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is 	deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information 	collected through passive means may be non-identifying or may be 	associated with you. In the latter case it will be treated as 	personally identifiable information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We 	use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help 	analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry 	out targeted promotional activities and to improve our services. We 	may use your non-personal information by itself or aggregate it with 	information we have obtained from others. We may share your 	non-personal information with our affiliated companies and third 	parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that 	aggregate information is anonymous information that does not 	personally identify you. We may provide our analysis and certain 	non-personal information to third parties (who may in turn use this 	information to provide advertisements tailored to your interests), 	but this will not involve disclosing any of your personally 	identifiable information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We 	allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain 	anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies 	may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream 	information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements 	clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web 	sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services 	likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically 	use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.

For security reasons, we do not recommend that you send 	non-public personally identifiable information, such as passwords, 	social security numbers or bank account information, to us by 	e-mail. Further, we may send you e-mail under the following 	circumstances: (a) if you request a particular service or sign up 	for a feature that involves e-mail communications; (b) if it relates 	to purchases you have made with us (e.g., product updates, customer 	support, etc.); (c) if we are sending you information about our 	other products and services; (d) if you consented to being contacted 	by e-mail for a particular purpose; (e) if you send us an e-mail, 	post information on the Website (i.e., a blog) or otherwise submit 	information to us electronically, we may e-mail you to follow-up or 	otherwise communicate with you with respect thereto; (f) to provide 	you legal notices or notices with respect to your use of the 	Website; or (g) to otherwise facilitate a transaction between us. In 	certain instances, we may provide you with the option to set your 	preferences for receiving e-mail communications from us; that is, 	agree to some communications but not others. You may "opt out" 	of receiving future commercial e-mail communications from us by 	clicking the "unsubscribe" link included at the bottom of 	most e-mails we send, or as provided below; provided, however, we 	reserve the right to send you transactional e-mails such as customer 	service communications.</p>

<p>Transfer 	of Assets:</p>
</li>
</ol> 
<ul>

<p>As 	we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. 	If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our 	assets, the personally identifiable information and non-personal 	information we have about you will be transferred to and used by 	this acquiring entity, though we will take reasonable steps to 	ensure that your preferences are followed.

<p>Sweepstakes 	Contests and Promotions:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions through the Website that may require registration. By entering any promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion. If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, personally identifiable information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.<br><br></p>

<li>
<p>Third 	Party Ad Server Networks:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Website may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Website and may use traffic measurement services to analyze traffic on the Website. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Website and other websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. The Website's third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your Computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your Computer via a Device Identifier. These third party cookies are set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Website, you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("</p>
<p><strong class="western">D. PUBLIC FORUMS</strong></p>
<p>We may offer chat rooms, message boards, bulletin boards or similar public forums where you and other users of our Website can communicate. The protections described in this Privacy Policy do not apply when you provide information (including personally identifiable information) in connection with your use of these public forums. We may use personally identifiable and non-personal information about you to identify you with a posting in a public forum. Any information you share in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our Website.<br><br></p>
<p><strong class="western">E. CHILDREN</strong></p>
<p>The features, programs, promotions and other aspects of our Website requiring personally identifiable information are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) and believe he or she has disclosed personally identifiable information to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@fixandflipnetwork.com.">info@fixandflipnetwork.com.</a> A parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) may review and request deletion of such child’s personally identifiable information as well as prohibit the use thereof.</p>
<p><strong class="western">F. KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information. In the unfortunate event that your "personally identifiable information" (as the term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by e-mail (at our sole and absolute discretion) to the last e-mail address you have provided us in the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances; provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation. From time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems.<br><br></p>
<p><strong class="western">G. OTHER SITES/LINKS</strong></p>
<p>Our Website may link to or contain links to other third party websites that we do not control or maintain, such as in connection with purchasing products referenced on our Website and banner advertisements. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party website. We encourage you to note when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of all third party websites before submitting any personally identifiable information.<br><br></p>

Please, note that we may not be able to fulfill certain requests while allowing you access to certain benefits and features of our Website. Also, please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Also, if you have made any public postings on the Website such as in forums or blogs, these communications cannot generally be removed.<br><br></p>
<p><strong class="western">J. CONSENT TO TRANSFER INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES</strong></p>
<p>The Website is operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States.
