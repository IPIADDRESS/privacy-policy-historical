<h2>NearlyFreeSpeech.Net Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>NearlyFreeSpeech.NET's Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally
identifiable information that we collect when you use our services.  This
policy does not apply to entities that we do not control, including 
member sites hosted by our service.</p>

<p>We collect personally identifiable information when you register for
service with us.  We also automatically receive and record information 
from our systems about your use of our services.  We use this information
to fulfill your requests related to our services.</p>

<p>We will not sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information 
to anyone.  Ever.  Period.  We will not disclose your personally identifiable 
information to any third party without your prior consent unless legally 
compelled to do so.  We will attempt to notify you any time we are 
forced to disclose your personally identifiable information unless we 
are legally prevented from doing so.</p>

<p>We will cooperate with all investigations conducted by law 
enforcement authorities of the United States of America when legally
required to do so.  Cooperation with law enforcement authorities from 
other countries and cooperation when it is not legally required are at our
sole discretion.  Our discretion looks favorably on freedom and justice,
and unfavorably on oppression and violence.  Unless legally prohibited,
we will inform you of any cooperation we provide to any law enforcement 
authorities.</p>

<p>We use session cookies on our site.  These cookies should not be 
permanently stored on your computer; restarting your browser should
eliminate them.  We use these cookies <strong>only</strong> for the 
following purposes:

</p><ol>
<li>To manage your login information in our member interface. (required)</li>
<li>To allow you to personalize your use of our forums. (optional)</li>
<li>In conjunction with our master installation of phpMyAdmin. 
(required only if you use our phpMyAdmin)</li>
</ol>

<p>You may be connecting through an intermediary such as AOL that adds tracking 
cookies for their own purposes.  We recommend using our secure site to 
defeat such illicit monitoring.</p>

<p>We will not use your personally identifiable information to market our 
products and services to you unless you specifically indicate you wish
us to do so.  We will not use your personally identifiable information
to market third party products and services to you.</p>

<p>If for any reason you terminate your service, we will destroy 
active records containing your personally identifiable information 
as soon as it is reasonable to do so.  Some information may continue 
to exist in our archived records.  If we terminate your service, we 
may retain enough information to prevent you from signing up for 
service in the future.</p>
