to improve and market our Website in general and our products in particular.</p>

above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from
you.&nbsp; You must “opt-in” and give us permission to use your Personally
Identifiable Information for any other purpose.&nbsp;

<b>CAN I UPDATE OR CORRECT MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</b></p>

<p>You can always contact us in order to (1) update or

other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to
third-parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update,
correction, change or deletion.</p>

<p>You should be aware that it is not technologically
possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided

and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp; If at any point we decide to
use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner significantly different
from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the
time it was collected, we will notify you by email, and you will have a choice
as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in the new
manner.&nbsp; We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that
generally will not affect our use of your Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp;
If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use our
Website.</p>
