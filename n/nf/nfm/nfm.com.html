our Website. We are dedicated to protecting the privacy of those who visit our
Website.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy governs the NFM.com website operated by Nebraska
Furniture Mart, Inc. (our “Website”) and explains how we collect your personal
information on our Website, how we protect such information, and the choices
you have concerning the use of such information.&nbsp;
    Please read this Privacy
Policy carefully. Except as we disclose in this Privacy Policy, we will not
sell, share, license, trade, or rent your personal information to others.</p>

<p><br>
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp; We will post any changes
to this Privacy Policy here so that you will always know what information we
gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose that
information to anyone.&nbsp; Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular
basis.&nbsp;
    By using our Website or any of our features, tools or resources that we
provide on our Website, including without limitation, any fee based products or

<p><b>WHAT
INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE?</b></p>

<p><br>
    &nbsp;We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and
non-personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><b><i>Personally
Identifiable Information.</i></b></p>

<p>Personally identifiable information is information that
identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you (“Personally
Identifiable Information”). Such Personally Identifiable Information may
include your name, address, email address, telephone number, age (primarily for
eligibility purposes) and billing and credit card information. We may request
Personally Identifiable Information from you when you register on our Website,
purchase products online or in connection with other services we may make available
on our Website from time to time.&nbsp; In all of these cases, we will collect
Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily submit
such information to us.&nbsp; Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not
sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable Information
other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.You do not have to provide us
with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit our Website.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    However, if
you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all
sections of our Website or purchase our products.&nbsp; In addition, we may not be
able to provide you with some of the other services we offer that are dependent
upon the collection of such information. </p>

<p><br>
<b><i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</i></b></p>

<p>When you visit our Website we may collect information that
by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as IP addresses,
browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the
use of our Website (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”).&nbsp; Non-Personally
Identifiable Information is used to help us understand who uses our Website and
to improve and market our Website in general and our products in particular.</p>

<p><br>
<b>WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE (INCLUDING THROUGH
THE USE OF COOKIES)?</b></p>

<p>We may collect information (including information that is
Personally Identifiable Information) from you in different manners and at
different places and times on our Website.&nbsp; We also may collect information
from you in connection with, or through, other information or services we may
make available on our Website from time to time.&nbsp; The following is a
description of the areas and/or manners in which we primarily collect
information about you.</p>

<p><br>
<b><i>Cookies.</i></b></p>

<p>We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information
passively using “cookies.”&nbsp;
    “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on
your computer in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your
computer on our Website and other websites.&nbsp;
    Cookies are used to personalize
your experience on our Website (such as dynamically generating content on web pages
specifically designed for you), and to allow us to statistically monitor how
you are using our Website to help us improve our online offerings. We also may
use cookies to target certain advertisements to your browser which may be of
interest to you or to determine the popularity of certain content.&nbsp;
    While you
are not required to accept our cookies to access our Website, if you reject
cookies, certain products, offerings, features, or resources of our Website may
not work properly and you may experience some loss of convenience.</p>

<p>We collect information, some of which may be Personally
Identifiable Information, that you voluntarily provide to us when you choose to
purchase our products online.&nbsp;
    We also collect information that you provide
voluntarily through responses to special offerings such as surveys,
questionnaires, self-assessment quizzes, contests and the like. Some of these
special offerings may ask you for additional information. We collect this
information in order to offer you products or services that we think may be of
interest to you.</p>

<p><br>
<b><i>Submission of Material.</i></b></p>

children about protecting their personal information while online. If a child has provided our website with
personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian call
800-336-9136 or <a href="https://www.nfm.com/contactus.aspx">contact us</a> and
we will delete the information about the child from our files.</p>

from you on our Website.</p>

<p>We may disclose information (including Personally
Identifiable Information) about you to our Affiliates. For purposes of this

with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search
warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process.&nbsp; We may
disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special circumstances when we
have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating
our Terms of Use <a href="http://www.nfm.com/TERMS.ASPX">http://www.nfm.com/TERMS.ASPX</a>
to protect the safety and/or security of our users, our Website or the general
public.</p>

<p>We may provide to third parties information about you that
does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such
information is combined with similar information of other users of our
Website.&nbsp; For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of
unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of our registered
user of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in
while on our Website.&nbsp; The third parties to which we may provide this
information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of
advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial
partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. </p>

<p><br>
<b>DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?</b></p>

<p>Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or
operated by Nebraska Furniture Mart, Inc.Please be aware that we are not
responsible for the privacy practices of such websites.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We encourage you to be
aware when our Website links to other websites and to read the privacy policies
or statements of each and every website.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies solely to
information collected by our Website.</p>


<p><br>
<b>IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE SECURE?</b></p>


<p>&gt;We want your information (including Personally
Identifiable Information) to remain as secure as possible.&nbsp; We strive to
provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our
servers through industry-standard techniques. We endeavor to secure the
Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers which we believe are
located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized access,
use, or alteration.&nbsp; Only employees and authorized agents, vendors and
suppliers who need access to your information to perform a specific task or
function are granted access to such information.&nbsp; In addition, all Nebraska
Furniture Mart, Inc. employees must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept
up-to-date on security practices.&nbsp; Any employee who violates this Privacy
Policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.&nbsp; We
also require that our authorized agents, vendors and suppliers (i) protect the
privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information consistent with this
Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable
Information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services
for which we contracted.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your
information (including Personally Identifiable Information) from loss, misuse
or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some
risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some
risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems.&nbsp; As a result,
while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the
security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your
own risk.</p>

above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from
you.&nbsp; You must “opt-in” and give us permission to use your Personally

other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to
third-parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update,
correction, change or deletion.</p>

<p>You should be aware that it is not technologically
possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided
to us from our system.&nbsp; The need to back-up our systems to protect information

impossible for us to locate.&nbsp; We promise that promptly after receiving your
request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in databases we
actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected,

from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the
time it was collected, we will notify you by email, and you will have a choice
as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in the new
manner.&nbsp; We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that

Website.</p>
