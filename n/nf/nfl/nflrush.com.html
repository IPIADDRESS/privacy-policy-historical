<h3 class="endzone">Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act Compliance</h3>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 requires websites that collect and store data from users under thirteen years old to inform parents about collection and data storage policies and obtain parental permissions. Once given, parents may revoke those permissions at any time informing us of their decision. We strictly adhere to these requirements and will make every effort to meet and exceed the requirements mandated by law <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.shtm.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="consent"></a></p>
<h3 class="endzone">Consent</h3>
<p>By using the NFLRUSH website products and/or services, you acknowledge that you have read this entire Privacy Policy and you consent to the practices described herein with respect to collection, use and disclosure of the Personal Information you and/or your child ("you") provides.</p>
<p>This represents the entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. The NFLRUSH website reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy in accordance with the terms herein at any time. We encourage you to visit this page often, review this Privacy Policy frequently, and remain informed about any changes to it.</p>
<p>If, after review, you still have questions about any portion of this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the contact information provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="collection"></a></p>
<h3 class="endzone">Information Collection and Use</h3>
<p><em>Personal Information</em><br>"Personal Information" means information that can identify a specific individual (including those under age 13), such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or other contact information, whether at work or at home.  Other information we may collect includes gender, age, first name, username and password that, in and of itself, is not personally identifiable.</p>
<p>In all cases in which we collect Personal Information, we specifically describe what information is collected in order to provide you with the product, service, or feature you have requested.</p>
<p>The NFLRUSH website collects Personal Information when you contact us, when parental consent is required, when you use any and all related products and services, when you submit a question or, when you visit websites of certain NFL partners, and when you enter promotions and sweepstakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Registration for The NFLRUSH Website</em><br>You are required to register in order to use selected features of the NFLRUSH website such as being able to customize your website experience.</p>
<p>In order to register, you must first complete the online registration form, which requires that you create a username and password and provide your first name and date of birth.  We do not ask for any personal information in order to register for the site.  Certain functionality of the NFLRUSH website, whether available now or in the future, may require parental consent for children under age 13 in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act. In such instances, we will direct you to a web page explaining the procedure for obtaining parental consent. Features of the NFLRUSH website that require parental consent for children under age 13 include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Permission to post a photo, artwork, video or essay that your child has submitted</p>
<p>* Permission to enter you in a contest, sweepstakes or promotion</p>
<p>* Permission to allow us to use your personal information to market the NFLRUSH website features and products directly to you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For children under age 13 that choose to participate in the above site activities, we will ask them to provide their first name only and the email address of a parent to obtain parental consent.  Please note that a child’s participation or access to an activity cannot be conditioned on him/her providing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Promotions, Contests and Sweepstakes</em><br>The NFLRUSH website provides you the opportunity to participate in promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes on the NFLRUSH website. Such promotions, contests and sweepstakes are also governed by the rules and regulations posted with such promotions, contests and sweepstakes. You should refer to the specific games, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes for the specific rules and regulations governing them.</p>
<p>If you or your parent (for those under age 13) participate, you will be required to register with the NFLRUSH website, which will require you to provide certain Personal Information. Participation in these promotions, contests and sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to register and provide your Personal Information. The requested information typically includes contact information, such as name, shipping address, e-mail address, and telephone number. We will use this information to notify winners and award prizes.</p>
<p>Additionally, during the registration process you may be given the choice to opt-in to receiving additional related communications from the NFLRUSH website, our respective representatives and/or subsidiaries.  If you decide to opt-in, we will use the information provided to send you communications described throughout this Privacy Policy.  Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications (please see the "Choice and Opt-Out" section of this Privacy Policy<a name="NAME"></a>) if at any time you decide you do not wish to receive such communications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Message Boards and Forums </em><br>All users may read and post comments to our message boards and forums, such as The Buzz and NFL Play 60, without having to register. All comments that are submitted are reviewed prior to posting and any comments containing personally identifiable information of any kind or inappropriate content will not be posted to the NFLRush website. There may be some areas of the NFLRush website where personal information is displayed, such as the names of contest winners or youth football participants, but this information will not be posted to the NFLRush website without prior consent from parent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="info"></a></p>
<h3 class="endzone">Other Information Collected</h3>
<p>Some information may be collected automatically every time you visit the NFLRUSH website, such as cookies and other identifiable and non-identifiable computer information. In addition, information may be collected from other independent, third-party sources. The NFLRUSH website also collects information about which pages you visit within the website. This site visitation data is generally identified only by a unique URL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em><br>The NFLRUSH website may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part of its interaction with your browser.</p>
<p>A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier (a file) that can be used to transfer data and personally identifiable information to and from your computer's hard drive through a Web browser to enable computing systems to recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>The NFLRUSH website uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the site. The NFLRUSH website uses persistent cookies to identify and track which sections of the site you most often visit. The NFLRUSH website also uses persistent cookies in areas of the site where you must register, and where you are able to customize the information you see, so that you do not have to enter your preferences more than once. These cookies do not collect Personal Information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other Personal Information collected to determine your identity, your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information, including information regarding those under age 13.</p>
<p>By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features of the NFLRUSH website, and you may be required to re-enter the information required to use site during new or interrupted browser sessions.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers, representatives and/or subsidiaries) may use cookies on the NFLRUSH website. The producers of the NFLRUSH website have no access to or control over these cookies (see "Third Party Advertising" and <a href="#cookie">"Third Party Cookies"</a> below).  Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the NFLRUSH website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Third Parties.</p>
<p>THE NFLRUSH WEBSITE DOES NOT DISCLOSE ITS COOKIES TO THIRD PARTIES EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY A VALID LEGAL PROCESS SUCH AS: SEARCH WARRANT, SUBPOENA, JURISDICTIONAL STATUTE, OR COURT ORDER.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Log Files</em><br>As is true of most websites, the NFLRUSH website gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet services provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data.</p>
<p>The NFLRUSH website uses this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the game and/or the website, to track users' movements and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>We do not combine information collected through log files with other Personal Information collected to determine your identity or personally identifiable information such as your e-mail address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technology</em><br>NFLRUSH uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Information from Third Party Sources</em><br>To improve services and enhance personalization, the NFLRUSH website may periodically obtain information about you from other independent third party sources and add it to our account information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="cookie"></a><em>Third Party Cookies</em><br>Third parties associated with the NFLRUSH website, including our representatives and/or subsidiaries, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your web browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="email"></a></p>
<h3 class="endzone">Email Communications</h3>
<p><em>Special Offers and Updates</em><br>The NFLRUSH website collects information about which sections and features of the site and/or game you visit most often, and we may use this information to send you information about relevant offers, promotions, contests, and sweepstakes which may interest you. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications (please see the <a href="#choice">"Choice and Opt-Out"</a> section of this Privacy Policy).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Service-related Announcements</em><br>The NFLRUSH website may, but is not obligated to send you strictly service-related announcements on occasions when it is necessary to do so. For example, if service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send you an e-mail.</p>
<p>Generally, you will have the option to opt-out of these communications even though they are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive these types of communications you have the option to deactivate your account, or to opt-out (please see the "<a href="#choice">Choice and Opt-Out</a>" section of this Privacy Policy).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Customer Service</em><br>Based upon the Personal Information you provide, the NFLRUSH website may send you a welcoming e-mail to verify your identity (including your username and password). We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. Generally, we will only communicate with you by e-mail or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="sharing"></a></p>
<h3 class="endzone">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>The NFLRUSH website does not sell, rent or share any of the personal information collected to third parties in ways other than described in this policy. This includes any personal information of those under age 13. If we did share this type of information with third parties, as a parent you would have the right to consent to the site's use of the child's Personal Information without having to consent to its disclosure of that information to third parties. Below are the ways in which we do share your personal information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Service Providers</em><br>The NFLRUSH website may disclose the personal information (including that of those under age 13) collected to external service providers, representatives and/or subsidiaries necessary to facilitate the following outsourced operations: address verification, web site hosting, email fulfillment, and product and/or service delivery. These external service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with the NFLRUSH website and other legal restrictions that prohibit the use of the information we provide to them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced operations listed above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Compliance with Legal Authorities</em><br>Your personal information, including that of children under age 13, may be transferred to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement agencies as required by a valid legal process (court order, subpoena), to protect our rights, or to protect the rights of other users of the NFLRUSH website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Third-Party Ad Serving &amp; Audience and Traffic Measurement Services</em><br>The NFLRUSH website may use a third-party "network advertiser" to serve the advertisements on the NFLRUSH website or may use an "audience traffic measurement service" to analyze the traffic on the NFLRUSH website. "Network advertisers" are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the NFLRUSH website and other websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or websites you might be interested in. "Audience and traffic measurement services" allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from the NFLRUSH website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although advertisers or other companies do not have access to the NFLRUSH website cookies, the NFLRUSH website's advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third-party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the activities described above. See "Web Beacons and Other Tracking Activity" section above. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.
