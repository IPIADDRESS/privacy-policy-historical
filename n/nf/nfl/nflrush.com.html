Once given, parents may revoke those permissions at any time informing us of their decision. We strictly adhere to these requirements and will make every effort to meet and exceed the requirements mandated by law. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.shtm</a>.

				<a id="consent"></a>
			</p>

			<p>
				<a id="collection"></a>
			</p>
			<h3 class="endzone">Information Collection and Use</h3>
			<p><em>Personal Information</em></p>
			<p>
				"Personal Information" means information that can identify a specific individual (including those under 13 years of age), such as your name, gender, address, phone number, e-mail address, or other contact information, whether at work or at home. Other information that we may collect, includes gender, age, first name, username and password that, in and of itself, is not personally identifiable.
			</p>
			<p>
				In all cases in which we collect Personal Information, we specifically describe what information is collected in order to provide you with the product, service, or feature you have requested.
			</p>
			<p>
				As described below, the Website, our representatives and/or subsidiaries collect Personal Information when you <a href="#contact">contact us</a>, when parental consent is required, when you register, when you use any and all related products and services, when you submit a question or purchase products and/or services offered for sale, when you visit websites of certain NFL partners, and when you enter promotions and sweepstakes.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not save any Personal Information from users under thirteen-years-old except their parent's email address. We collect an e-mail address from each user in the registration process which protects the site from spam "bots" that search out and attack unprotected registrations. Our registration process delivers an e-mail to the registering user and then immediately and permanently deletes the email address of anyone under thirteen years of age. In the case where a user contacts us via the "Contact Us" area of the Website, we will respond to this one-time email and delete any email address that is associated with a user under the age of 13.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may collect your geo-location information for the purpose of setting your clock for the game feed, otherwise we do not ask for, access, or track any location based information from your mobile device.
			</p>
			<p><em>Registration for The Website &amp; Mobile Applications</em></p>
			<p>
				You are required to register in order to use selected features of the Website such as being able to customize your website experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to register, you must first complete the online registration form, which requires that you create a username and password. During registration, you are also required to provide Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, gender and birth date, so that we may contact you about the services on the site(s) in which you have expressed interest and so that we may verify your age.
			</p>
			<p>
				Certain functionality of the Website may require parental notice or consent for children under 13 years of age in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act. When a registrant indicates they are under 13 years of age, we will only collect first name, gender, parent's email address and birth date. Parent's of under 13 years of age users will be sent a parental notice indicating their child's wish to join the Website, information about the activities on the Website, disclosure of the information collected from the child including username and password, as well as instructions for the parent to delete membership. The full privacy policy is also included in this notice.  In such instances where parental consent is needed, we will direct you to a web page explaining the procedure for obtaining parental consent.  Features of the Website that require parental consent for children under 13 include, but are not limited to, the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Permission to post a photo, artwork, video or essay that your child has submitted</li>
				<li>Permission to enter you in a contest, sweepstakes or promotion</li>
				<li>Permission to allow us to use your personal information to market the Website features and products directly to you.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Children under age 13 that choose to participate in the above site activities will be asked to provide their first name only and the email address of a parent to obtain parental consent.  Please note that a child's participation or access to an activity cannot be conditioned on him/her providing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.

Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications (please see the "Choice and Opt-Out" section of this Privacy Policy) if at any time you decide you do not wish to receive such communications.  Parents of users under thirteen years of age may also opt-in their child to receive additional related communications from the Website and the NFL.  A parent can  review, change or delete the Personal Information of their children at any time by emailing their children's username and parent's email address associated with the account, and their request, to us at <a href="mailto:nflrushprivacy@nfl.com">nflrushprivacy@nfl.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a child chooses to sign up for an upgraded membership to NFL Rush Zone, the child's parent will need to complete the purchase form and pay for the membership using their credit card. Some of the payment methods accepted by the Website will require you to visit a trusted third party site.

All comments that are submitted are reviewed prior to posting and any comments containing personally identifiable information of any kind or inappropriate content will not be posted to the Website.

			<p><em>Cookies</em></p>
			<p>
				The Website may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part of its interaction with your browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier (a file) that can be used to transfer data and personally identifiable information to and from your computer's hard drive through a Web browser to enable computing systems to recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

				Parents of users under age 13 who provide consent for NFLRush to collect, use or disclose the Personal Information of their children may request to refuse further collection and use, review, change or delete the Personal Information of their children collected on the site by emailing their children's username and their request, to us at <a href="mailto:nflrushprivacy@nfl.com">nflrushprivacy@nfl.com</a> or <a href="mailto:nflrushsafety@nfl.com">nflrushsafety@nfl.com</a>.

			<p>
				<a id="links"></a>
			</p>
			<h3 class="endzone">Links to Other Websites</h3>
			<p>
				There may be places throughout the Website that may link you to other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. When you click through to these websites, this Privacy Policy no longer applies.
			</p>
			<p><em>Chat Rooms, Forums, and Message Boards</em></p>
			<p>
				The Website includes a highly restrictive chat feature that prevents users from sharing their Personal Information with others. Several measures have been taken to prevent users from abusing the chat feature in an effort to share their Personal Information or to harass other users on the site. For example, when using this feature, users cannot type the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Numbers (phone numbers, zip codes, residence numbers, etc.)</li>
				<li>Proper Names (with the exception of NFL Team Names, etc.)</li>
				<li>Geographical Locations (city, state, street names, etc.)</li>
				<li>Email addresses</li>
				<li>Explicit words</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The chat feature is also monitored regularly by Website administrators to ensure that users communicate with others in a safe and respectful manner. In the event that someone is found to be abusing the chat feature, users can report the misconduct to the Website administrators, who will then take appropriate action. Reported users may be suspended or banned from the site.
			</p>
			<p>
				The use of the Website and all forums therein are governed by the Terms of Use, a copy which can be found in the footer at <a target="_blank" href="http://accounts.nflrush.com/web/manage">http://accounts.nflrush.com/web/manage</a>, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the event there exists any inconsistency between this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, regarding the use of information, the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy shall take precedent.
			</p>
			<p>
				We reserve the right to terminate your membership with the Website in the event you use the Website, including, without limitation, the forums, in a manner inconsistent with the Terms of Use.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a id="storage"></a>
			</p>
			<h3 class="endzone">Storage and Security of Personal Information</h3>
			<p><em>Storage</em></p>
			<p>The Website stores the information we collect on computers located in a controlled, secure facility protected from physical and/or electronic unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</p>
			<p><em>Security</em></p>
			<p>We protect the privacy and integrity of the information collected by employing appropriate administrative protocols, technical safeguards, and physical security controls designed to limit access, detect and prevent the unauthorized access, improper disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the information under our control. We transmit the information used by external service providers for the specific outsourced operations listed above across public and private networks via recognized encryption technologies, such as by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input.</p>
			<p>Although we follow the procedures set forth above to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Thus, while the Website, our representatives and/or subsidiaries strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions about security, please feel free to <a href="#contact">contact us</a>.</p>
			<p><em>Internet Fraud</em></p>
			<p>We have a Zero Tolerance policy for Internet fraud or any attempt to access or acquire customer and/or other information via illegal or surreptitious means. We work with local, national, and international fraud investigation agencies as required and employ a variety of electronic and other means to discourage, detect, and intercept fraudulent activities.</p>
			<p>We will aggressively prosecute to the fullest extent of the law those perpetrators apprehended who conduct fraudulent activities. Agencies with which the Website, our representatives and/or subsidiaries cooperate include (but are not limited to) state and local police authorities, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, US and International Customs Agencies, and Interpol.</p>
			<p><em>Email Abuse</em></p>
			<p>We have a Zero Tolerance policy for e-mail abuse. Our e-mail and e-mail list administrators take strong measures to ensure that any and all of our mailing lists are NOT used for abusive purposes. Further, our e-mail mailing list administrators maintain an "Ignore List" of e-mail addresses from which all information inquiries are ignored. E-mail addresses are added to the Ignore List when our e-mail mailing list administrators receive abusive or otherwise inappropriate email from listed e-mail addresses.</p>
			<p>Personal Information collected by the Website may be stored and processed in the United States and/or any other country in which the NFL or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using other NFL websites, properties, products and/or services, you consent to any such transfer of Personal Information outside of your country.</p>

			<p><a id="international"></a></p>
			<h3 class="endzone">International Transfer</h3>
			<p>Personal Information collected by the NFLRUSH website may be stored and processed in the United States and/or any other country in which the NFL or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using other NFL websites, properties, products and/or services, you consent to any such transfer of Personal Information outside of your country.</p>
			<p><strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
			<p><strong>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of the National Football League who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please <a href="#contact">contact us</a>, or write us at CA Privacy Rights, NFL.com, 345 Park Ave, New York, NY 10154.</strong></p>
			<p><a id="changes"></a></p>
			<h3 class="endzone">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>We will from time-to-time update this Privacy Policy, each time revising the last updated date at the top of the Privacy Policy and indicate the nature of the revisions within the statement. We will notify customers of material changes to this statement by e-mail or by placing prominent notice on the homepage of the Website. If we make material changes to how we use Personal Information collected from children under the age of 13, we will notify parents by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of the child's Personal Information.</p>
