  <a name="info" id="info"></a><strong>HOW  INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED </strong><br><br>
  We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website,  including but not limited to those described below: <br><br>
  <strong><em>Registration</em></strong><br><br>

  When you register to play games on our Website, you may be asked to provide  personally identifiable information. <br><br>
  <strong><em>Cookies</em></strong><br><br>
  As with many websites, our Website uses a technology called  "cookies." A cookie is a collection of information that gets stored  on the hard drive of your computer when browsing the Internet. These small bits  of code automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your  computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let us know how many people  visit our Website and where visitors go on the Website. In addition, cookies  can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like how many times a  user has been on certain pages. For registered users, cookies can make using  the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or  preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us  determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and  updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting  cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the  Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising which  may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the  use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to  disable or delete cookie data at any time.

  <strong><em>Web Beacons and  Other Tracking Technology</em></strong><br><br>
  Our Website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes,  including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded  in images on the pages of Web sites.

These technical methods may  involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another  party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.

The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form  that is personally identifiable. <br><br>
  <strong><em>IP Addresses and  Click-Stream Data</em></strong><br><br>

An IP address is a number  associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your  ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing  alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP  addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate  information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the  frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our Websites. We may  combine this information with personally identifiable information. Click-stream  data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from  the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served,  the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request,  the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed,  this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of  content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested  in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like. <br><br>

  <li><strong>Third-Party Ad Serving &amp;       Audience and Traffic Measurement Services:</strong> The Website may use a third       party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Website or may       use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Website. Network       advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your       visits to this Website and other websites you have visited. Third-party ad       serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or       websites you might be interested in. Audience and Traffic Measurement       Services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information       from our Website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity.

Cookies allow third       party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be       interested in. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page)       served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve       as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously       described activities. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to       their own privacy policies, not this one.
