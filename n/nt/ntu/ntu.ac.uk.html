                                          <li>Webbugs are minute images (commonly 1 pixel x 1 pixel to be exact) that transmit data on use of the internet back to a computer
                                             specified by the webbug. Information fed back by web bugs is often similar to the sort of information you will find in a cookie,
                                             such as the sites that you have recently visited and potentially the characteristics of the machine that you were using. You
                                             can find out more about webbugs by visiting <a class="MainText" href="http://www.bugnosis.org/faq.html#web%20bug%20basics">http://www.bugnosis.org/faq.html</a>. Before you access that site you should remind yourself of our policy on links which is contained in our <a href="/disclaimer">Access Agreement</a>. The bugnosis.org site also tells you what you can do to find out what a webbug is doing or how to stop it coming to your
                                             computer altogether. You should remember that we cannot guarantee that any anti-webbug software you install will not cause
                                             harm to your computer.
