          to enable our system to recognise your browser and to provide features

          the sort of information you will find in a cookie, such as the sites 
          that you have recently visited and potentially the characteristics of 
          the machine that you were using. You can find out more about webbugs 
          by visiting <a class="MainText" href="http://www.bugnosis.org/faq.html#web%20bug%20basics">http://www.bugnosis.org/faq.html</a>. 
          Before you access that site you should remind yourself of our policy 
          on links which is contained in our  <a class="MainText" href="generic.cfm?show=Disclaimer">Access Agreement</a>. The bugnosis.org site also tells you what you can do to find 
          out what a webbug is doing or how to stop it coming to your computer 
          altogether. You should remember that we cannot guarantee that any anti-webbug
