<h2>What information we collect and how we use it</h2>
<p>We ask those interested in obtaining more information about Nielsen's products and services to provide their names, email addresses, name of their company or website, telephone number and industry. Clients may gain access to their information through this site and may use a password or other means of authentication to do so.

<h2>Cookies and Web beacons</h2>
<p>To keep track of your choice of language and home page preference, we place a cookie on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Our “preference” cookie expires after thirty (30) days. We also use a small piece of code (sometimes referred to as “1x1 clear pixel,” “Web beacon” or “clear GIF”) placed in the pages of our website to help us gather additional information about which parts of the site receive the most visitors and other user traffic patterns, and enable us to administer the site. We also use cookies to understand your Internet usage, including other websites that you visit and, occasionally, your exposure to certain Internet advertisements as you surf the Web. To opt out of this explicitly, please <a href="http://server-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/o?oo=total&amp;tu=http://www.netratings.com/privacy_opt.jsp?section=leg_opt%26opt=2" target="_blank">click here</a>.

<p>No personally-identifiable information is contained in our cookies or transmitted through our Web beacons.</p>

<p>You can set your browser to reject most cookies by following the browser help file directions.

<h2>When we may disclose your information to others</h2>
<p>From time to time, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice, we may partner with unaffiliated companies or individuals for market research product development or similar purposes. These companies or individuals may be provided with access to personally identifiable information, but we will require by contract that they agree to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of such information. We also may subcontract with other companies and individuals to do work on our behalf; they may be provided with access to personally identifiable information, but only as needed to perform their functions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice, we may disclose personally identifiable information to any third party when disclosure is required by law, or desirable to permit us to exercise or preserve our legal rights or take action regarding potentially illegal activities or to protect the safety of any person. In the event that The Nielsen Company is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>This site is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian believes that this site has collected the personally-identifiable information of a child under the age of 13, please contact <a href="mailto:nielsencookieoptout@nielsen.com">nielsencookieoptout@nielsen.com</a> and we will use our best efforts to remove the information from our records.</p>

<h2>Access to your information</h2>
<p>You may contact us if at any time you would like to see the personally identifiable information we hold about you, or to ask us to correct or update this information, or to ask us to delete it.</p>

<h2>Data storage, transfers and security</h2>
<p>We may store the personal details we hold about you for as long as needed, which may be indefinitely. We may store this information in the United States or we may transfer it to any other country. The data protection laws in countries to which personal data are transferred may or may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your home country. Wherever we hold the data, we will apply the terms of this Notice and any applicable data protection law. We maintain certain procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of personally identifiable information while it is controlled by us. However, the storage and communication of personal data cannot always be completely secure. Also, we cannot and do not guarantee that data transferred to third parties in accordance with this Notice will be protected against intentional or accidental misuse or loss.</p>
