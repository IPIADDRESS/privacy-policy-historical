The amount of information that you provide to Nissan will depend on the range and number of services that you choose to use. Particular sections of the Nissan website may require you to provide Nissan with personal information, including your name and email address. Personal information will only be requested if it is necessary to provide a service to you or if it is necessary by law to collect the information. </p> <p> We do not currently use cookies on our website to collect personal information about you. </p> <p> By using the Nissan website you agree that the internet is inherently insecure and that accordingly we can only use our best endeavours to secure your personal information and cannot provide any definitive assurance regarding security of personal information. Other than liability that cannot lawfully be excluded, Nissan and NFS will not be liable in any way in relation to any breach of security or any unintended loss or disclosure of that information. <br> <br> </p> <p> <strong><u>Miscellaneous</u></strong><br> In this policy "personal information" has the same meaning as under the Privacy Act. </p> <p> This policy is effective from 1 October 2008. We may change this policy from time to time. Although we intend to observe this Privacy Policy at all times, it is not legally binding on Nissan and NFS in any way. From time to time we may regard it as necessary or desirable to act outside the policy. Nissan and NFS may do so, subject only to any other applicable contractual rights you have and any statutory rights you have under the Privacy Act or other applicable legislation. </p> </span> <p> &nbsp; </p> <p> &nbsp; </p><p></p>
