<strong>Our commitment to privacy</strong><br>
<br>
Nidokidos.org ("nidokidos", "we" or "our") has created this privacy policy in 
order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of personally 
identifiable information about users of NidoKidoS. Our commitment to you is that 
we will not disclose information collected from you other than as described in 
this policy. The following discloses in detail our information collection, 
utilization and dissemination practices of information collected through our 
Site. <br>
<br>
<strong>Our privacy policy in short</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We will only use personal information you provide us according to the 
  terms outlined in this document.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>In order to utilize the features and services offered through this Site, 
  you must provide a limited amount of information.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>We will never provide personally identifiable information about you to 
  third parties without your consent or unless we are required to do so by law.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<strong>What information do we collect?</strong><br>
<br>
During general use of the Site, services offered on the Site or as otherwise 
identified below, we collect personal, demographic and preference information, 
email address and other personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") 
from all users or visitors to the Site. All users must agree to the applicable
<a href="http://nidokidos.org/legal/tos.html">Terms of Service</a> posted on the 
Site.<br>
<br>
In addition, we collect certain information, which cannot be used to personally 
identify any user, and which may be provided to third parties. Such non-personal 
data ordinarily includes aggregate, summary, or other usage data, and may 
include, by way of example, statistics regarding total users, information 
regarding types of Internet browsers used by users, and widget usage patterns. 
We also collect non-personal data about each users IP address to help diagnose 
problems with our server, and to administer our Site.<br>
<br>
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your 
browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the 
full functionality of the website. .<br>
<br>
Any user providing personal data is certifying that he/she is over the age of 
13. As such, we do not collect or maintain personal data from individuals we 
actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site is designed to 
attract people under 13. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to 
us. Thus, if we ever obtain knowledge that that a user is under 13, we will take 
steps to remove that user's personal data from our databases and to prevent the 
user from utilizing the Site.<br>
<br>
<strong>How do we use and disclose collected information?</strong><br>
<br>
Nidokidos, like most other sites, uses cookies to provide you with a more 
personalized and user-friendly experience. We may also use cookies to help us 
deliver content or advertising specific to your interests, and to save your 
preferences or passwords so you don't have to re-enter them each time you visit 
our site. Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, but then your 
preferences, passwords and other information will not be saved, and you may have 
to re-enter information to use certain features of our Site. <br>
<br>
We may also log IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration or to 
report information in aggregate form to our advertisers (e.g., how many visitors 
logged in to our Web site). In some cases your IP address stays the same from 
browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet service 
provider (ISP), chances are that your IP address varies each session? Thus 
making it effectively impossible for us to use your IP address (by itself) to 
determine who you are. <br>
<br>
In general, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties 
except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under 
circumstances required by law. We will disclose your personal information when 
we believe in good faith that any applicable law, regulation, or legal process 
requires it, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce 
our rights or the rights of another user. We also disclose aggregated user 
statistics in order to describe our services and reach to prospective partners, 
advertisers, and other third parties. However, aggregate data is not traceable 
to you specifically. We may use contractors to help us with our operations. Some 
or all of these contractors may access our databases of user information. These 
contractors will enter into an agreement with us that places restrictive 
provisions on their use and disclosure of all information they obtain through 
the relationship. <br>
<br>
<strong>Information from Other Sites</strong><br>
<br>
Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a 
user's prior visits to your website. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it 
and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites 
and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART 
cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">
advertising opt-out page</a>. (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of 
a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising 
Initiative <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">
opt-out page</a>.) We use Google Adsense and DoubleClick to display Ads on our 
website. Google may display Interest-based advertisements on your computer which 
will allow advertisers to show ads based on a user's previous interactions with 
them, such as visits to advertiser website and also to reach users based on 
their interests (e.g. "sports enthusiast"). To develop interest categories, 
Google Adsense will recognize the types of web pages users visit throughout the 
Google content network. As an example, if they visit a number of sports pages, 
Google Adsense will add them to the "sports enthusiast" interest category. <br>
<br>
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our website. 
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on 
their visit to our site. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by 
visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google ad and 
content network privacy policy</a>.<br>
<br>
The Opt-out Tool is cookie-based. In order for the Tool to work on your 
computer, your browser must be set to accept third party cookies. If you buy a 
new computer, change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to 
perform the opt-out task again.<br>
<br>
NidoKidoS uses third party sites for hosting images. These sites may gather data 
from the referrer logs that identify where and how frequently user images being 
hosted on the respective sites are being displayed on NidoKidoS in order to 
provide more relevant advertising and monitor user bandwidth usage.<br>
<br>
NidoKidoS contains links and advertisements to other sites. If you click-through 
a banner ad or link and submit your information to that advertiser or site, you 
will be subject to their own privacy practices. NidoKidoS is not responsible for 
the privacy practices or the content of such other sites.<br>
<br>
<strong>Security Precautions</strong><br>
<br>
NidoKidoS makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available 
to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these 
areas becomes public information and that if you disclose personal contact 
information in these areas, others may use it to send you unsolicited messages. 
We do not control the actions of our guests and registered members. NidoKidoS 
encourages our users to be smart about choosing when, and to whom to release 
information online.<br>
<br>
Of course there are many other ways we conceivably could get information from or 
about you that are not described elsewhere in this Statement. For example, you 
might email us through one of our customer service email addresses, or we may 
get a complaint about you from a third party. Our practices with respect to such 
information are pretty much as you'd expect -- we use and disclose this 
information in a commercially reasonable business manner. <br>
<br>
<strong>Our commitment to data security</strong><br>
<br>
This site has industry consistent security measures in place to protect the 
loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. But since the 
Internet cannot be made absolutely secure, NidoKidoS assumes no liability for 
disclosure of data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized third parties.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Mailing list subscriptions</strong><br>
<br>
NidoKidoS provides instructions for how to unsubscribe to future mailings at the 
bottom of each communication. Please remember to check the registration screens 
applicable to the service or promotion for which you are signing up for specific 
instructions from our partners on how to update your user profile and/or opt out 
of receiving offers and mailings.<br>
<br>
<strong>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</strong><br>
<br>
By using NidoKidoS, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Statement. If 
you are not comfortable with any policy described in this Privacy Statement, you 
may feel free to e-mail us with questions or concerns, but your only remedy is 
to discontinue use of the Site. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy 
Statement at any time. <br>
