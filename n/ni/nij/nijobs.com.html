                        <li>17.1.3	Request erasure of your personal data.  This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.  You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.  Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
                        <li>17.1.4	Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.  You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.  In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
                        <li>17.1.5	Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                        <li>17.1.6	Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.  We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.  Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. </li>
                        <li>17.1.7	Withdraw consent at any time if and to the extent we are relying on consent as the legal basis to process your personal data.  However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.  If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.  We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>17.2	Regarding your right to have your personal data erased, you can delete your user account with NIJobs.com at any time.  Deleting your user account deletes records of job applications sent, CVs and cover letters stored in your account, your profile, saved jobs and job alerts.  Once your user account is deleted, it is gone forever and cannot be restored.  Some personal data however may still be stored and visible in other places on the Website.  For example, if you have applied for a job, your application information including your name, email, CV and cover letter may still be visible to the Customer in their user account on the Website.  We will endeavour to contact Customers we know who have accessed your personal data within the previous 18 months and inform them of your request to erase your personal data. </p>
                    <p>17.3	You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).  However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.  Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.  We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.  We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. </p>

                    <p>17.4	In order to exercise one or more of your rights in respect of your personal data, you can do so from the Account Settings option in Your Account on the Website.  Alternatively, please contact us at <a href="mailto: gdpr@NIJobs.com" title="email gdpr@NIJobs.com">gdpr@NIJobs.com</a>.  We will respond to your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any case within the legally required period of time.</p>
                    <p>17.5	You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office, the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank">ico.org.uk</a>. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the Information Commissioner's Office so please contact us in the first instance at <a href="mailto: gdpr@NIJobs.com" title="email gdpr@NIJobs.com">gdpr@NIJobs.com</a></p>
