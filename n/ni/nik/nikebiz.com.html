		<p>Like many websites, we gather information about how visitors use our website. In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track your visit for trends and statistics, but you will remain anonymous unless you tell us who you are. Once you choose to give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. For more information, see "Cookies and Pixel Tags" section below.</p>

		  * Participate in a promotion or other website feature</p>
		<p>In order to better understand your preferences and better serve you, we may combine information you give us online with other information from Nike sources, transactions and communications. This may include data from Nike stores, direct mail, events, or online marketing. We may also combine that information with data that is publicly available and data that we receive from other reputable sources. This data may include postal address updates and demographic data. We collect information about gift recipients to fulfill the gift purchase, respond to customer service inquiries and for analysis purposes only. All data combined and stored with online data is protected by this privacy policy.</p>

		<p><a href="#top" class="backToTop">back to top</a></p>
		<a name="sharing"><h4>Sharing Information</h4></a>
		<p>For the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer information between Nike and our preferred service providers who use that information only to conduct Nike business. For example, they may handle Nike's credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management. We may also share your information to administer a website feature (e.g., music download or race registration) and in that case will notify you before you give us your information. We provide our preferred service providers with the information they need to perform their services and work with them to respect and protect your information.</p>
		<p>From time to time we might establish a business relationship with carefully selected persons or companies whom we believe trustworthy. These are known as our Select Partners. In such cases we might share and cross-reference information, including personally identifiable information about you that will enable such persons or entities to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share any information with these companies, please click here.</p>
		<p>We may provide your information to NIKE Inc. wholly-owned companies and affiliates, which may be outside the U.S. We may provide information to other companies for purposes such as reporting and marketing.</p>
		<p>On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.</p>
		<p><a href="#top" class="backToTop">back to top</a></p>
		<a name="protecting"><h4>Protecting Your Information</h4></a>
		<p>We use a variety of security measures, including sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secure networks and is only accessible to a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be accessed only as stated above. Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
