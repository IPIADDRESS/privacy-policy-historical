      Nike is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our web site. The following policy describes how Nike collects, protects and uses information it receives from visitors to the web site. If you would like to review our policies specifically applicable to children, see <a href="#dob">"Children’s Privacy"</a> below.</font>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><b>What information does Nike collect and how does Nike use it?</b></font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">When you register on the site, we need you to provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, day phone number, date of birth, and credit card information (when ordering products only), as well as create a username and password. This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for users to submit information to Nike, and receive back either the information or products desired.<br>
						<br>
						</font>
						</li><li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"> When you register, we also allow you the discretion whether or not to submit your evening phone number, gender, favorite athlete and favorite sport. This allows us to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to you.<br>
						<br>
						</font>
						</li><li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Visitors will also be given a choice when registering whether they would like to be on Nike’s mailing list, or whether they would prefer to opt-out and not receive such mailings from Nike.<br>
<br>
						</font>
						</li><li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The site contains an anonymous shopping feature whereby visitors who desire to purchase products can elect not to register.  Those who elect to purchase products without registering will be asked only for information necessary to process the transaction and ensure compliance with Nike’s children’s privacy policy.  Information provided by anonymous shoppers will be retained only as necessary to process the transaction and maintain Nike’s sales records and will not be used for marketing purposes.<br>
						<br>
						</font>
						</li><li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, Nike may again ask for the visitor’s name, address, e-mail address, date of birth, username and password so that they are able to better administer the contest and notify winners.<br>
						<br>
						</font>
						</li><li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">We may also use the information we collect during the registration process to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new Nike services, and special offers we think you’ll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, or would like to opt-out of any other information request or distribution, simply reply to any Nike e-mail sent to you and type UNSUBSCRIBE as the subject of your reply.</font>
					</li></ul>
					<p><a name="1"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><b>How does Nike protect visitor information?</b></font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><br>
					Nike implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into Nike’s databases to be only accessed as stated above.<br>
					<br><a name="2">
					<b>Does Nike use "cookies"?</b></a><br>
					Yes. Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor’s hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor’s individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web sites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access most of the features on Nike’s site. However, cookies are used by Nike to track shopping basket items through the order and browsing process, so you won’t be able to place an on-line order if you disable cookies.  Visitors who disable cookies can still place orders over the telephone by calling Nike’s customer service number. We also contract with third parties who assign cookies (which do not contain any personally identifiable information) to conduct tracking.  These companies use cookies solely to provide aggregate data to Nike.

					<b>Does Nike disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outside parties?</b></a><br>
					Nike does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer outside the company to any third parties personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily provide to us in any registration, contest, or other submission. This information is used to better understand visitors’ use of Nike’s site and to support related transactions made on the site. The term "third party" does not include web site hosting partners and other parties who assist Nike in operating the web site, so long as such parties have signed confidentiality agreements with Nike obligating them to keep customer data confidential.<br>
					<br>
					However, this data in an aggregate form may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.<br>

					<br>Nike may also use e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information to contact visitors who communicate with us. For example, we direct e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific purposes such as receiving our e-mail newsletters or being notified if they have won one of our contests. Each e-mail newsletter always contains instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter. However, if a visitor at anytime chooses to no longer receive such information and opt-out from any future mailings, they should simply reply to any Nike e-mail sent to them and type UNSUBSCRIBE as the subject of their reply.<br>

					<b>Nike’s special note to parents</b></a><br>
					 Nike realizes that many children will visit them on the Internet, and Nike therefore encourages children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to any web site, including Nike’s. However, Nike believes that it is ultimately the parents’ responsibility to supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the <a href="javascript:openWind('http://www.the-dma.org',600,400)">Direct Marketing Association home page</a>.<br>
					<br><a name="6">
					<b>How does a visitor opt-out, remove, or modify information they have provided to Nike?</b></a><br>
					After gathering any user information, Nike offers users the opportunity to remove their information from our database so as not to receive future communications or to no longer interact with the web site until they later chose to visiting the "Members" section of the site and deleting the information they have previously provided.  Nike additionally provides users the opportunity to update and modify any information they have previously provided by visiting the "Members" section of and updating and/or modifying the information previously provided.<br>
					<br><a name="7">
					</a></font><a name="7"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><b>Third party links</b></font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><br>
					In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, Nike may choose various third party web sites to link to from its own site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with Nike, Nike has no control over these linked sites who each have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Nike. Nike has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, Nike seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any  <a href="/support/talktous.html">feedback</a> on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).<br>

	In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, Nike has adopted special procedures applicable to personal information from children under the age of 13.  The following procedures applicable to children supersede any conflicting portions of Nike’s general privacy policy.
<br>
					<br>
					<b>
					Contact Information<br>
					</b>

This web site is operated by Nike Retail Services, Inc., One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005.  <br><br>



					<br>
					<b><a name="dob1">What information does Nike collect from children and how does Nike collect it?</a><br>
					</b>

When a child attempts to order products or register on the site, the child will be asked to provide his or her name, date of birth, e-mail address, mailing address, day phone number and credit card information (when ordering products only), as well as to create a user name and password.  The child will also be given the option of providing the child’s evening phone number, gender, product sizing information, favorite athlete, favorite sport, and other information regarding the child’s preferences or interests, and will be asked to either opt-in or opt-out of Nike’s mailing list.<br>
<br>
When a child under the age of 13 attempts to submit his or her registration information, Nike’s system will reject the submission and give the child the option of downloading and/or printing a parental consent form, which the child may ask his or her parents to sign and mail or fax to Nike.  The consent form will request the information initially requested during the online registration process.  Nike will not collect or retain any personal information from a child under the age of 13 until Nike receives a signed parental consent form.  <br><br>

As described in Nike’s general privacy policy above, Nike may use cookies to gather information that will be associated with a child’s personal information.  Cookies allow Nike to better customize visits to the site to match the child’s preferences.<br>
					<br>
					<b>

<a name="dob2">How does Nike use information about children?</a><br>
					</b>

Information about children under the age of 13 whose parents have returned signed consent forms will be used internally by Nike to notify the child about important changes to the web site, new Nike services, and special offers the child may find valuable.  Personal information will also be used for order fulfillment if a child is authorized to enter into credit card transactions.  Children, like adults, may always opt-out of future information requests or distributions by entering the word UNSUBSCRIBE as the subject of a reply to any Nike e-mail.<br><br>

Children under the age of 13 will never be asked to consent to disclosure to third parties, and their personal information will not be disclosed to any third parties.  A parent’s consent to Nike’s collection and use of personal information about a child will never be treated as a consent to disclosure of that information to third parties.  (The term "third party" does not include web site hosting partners and other parties who assist Nike in operating the web site, as long as such parties have signed confidentiality agreements with Nike obligating them to keep customer data confidential).
<br><br>
Nike is prohibited from conditioning a child’s participation in an activity or contest on the disclosure of any more personal information than is reasonably necessary to allow the child to participate in that activity.
<br>
					<br>
					<b>
<a name="dob3">How does Nike protect information about children?</a><br>
					</b>

Nike is required by law to take reasonable security measures to protect personal information about children.  Registration information submitted by a child’s parent cannot be modified except through submission of a modified parental consent form or other written request.  All such information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of Nike employees and contractors who have special access rights to such systems.  All contractors have signed confidentiality agreements with Nike.  All credit card information supplied by children and other site visitors is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into Nike’s databases to be used and accessed only as described in this policy.
<br>
					<br>
					<b>
<a name="dob4">How can parents review their child’s personal information and prevent its use or disclosure?</a><br>
					</b>

Nike will delete personal information about a child upon receipt of a written request from the parent who initially submitted such information.  In the event of such a request, Nike will retain only information necessary for recordkeeping in connection with past transactions.<br><br>

Parents who submitted personal information about their children may also submit a signed written request to review or modify the information about their children.  Before disclosing information about a child, Nike may request that the parent provide reasonable information about the parent for identification purposes, such as the parent’s name, address, phone number, credit card number, or other information.
