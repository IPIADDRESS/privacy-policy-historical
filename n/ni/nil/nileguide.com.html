<h1 style="margin:0px">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<div class="hr"></div>
At Nileguide.com ("Company"), we know that you care about
how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your
privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our
privacy policy. By accessing the Company website and using the
services, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy
Policy.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</strong>
<br>
This Privacy Policy covers Company´s treatment of personally
identifiable information ("Personal Information") that
Company gathers when you are on the Nileguide.com website and when you
use the services, including registration based features. The types of
Personal Information collected may include your full name, street
address, email address, birth year, gender, city, state, zip code,
country, and travel destinations.
<br>
<br>
Also, this Policy covers the Company´s treatment of any Personal
Information that the Company´s business partners share with the
Company. This Policy does not apply to the practices of third party
service providers with which Company may partner but does not own or
control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What Personal Information About Customers Does Company
Collect?</strong>
<br>
Our primary goal in collecting Personal Information is to provide you
with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We may collect
the following types of information from our customers:
<br>
<br>
<strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong>
<br>
We receive and store any information you enter on our website or
provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with
certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of
many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is
used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain
features and services, customizing the advertising and content you
see, and communicating with you about specials and new services.
<br>
<br>
Registration: In order for you to use our registration-based services,
you must complete a registration form. We require your contact
information (such as screen name and email address).  We may also
request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to
provide you with a more personalized service.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Automatic Information:</strong>
<br>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
interact with us via our website.  The Company automatically receives
and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs
including your IP address, cookie information, the page you requested,
and your communications and interactions with other site registrants.
The Company uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its
server, analyze trends and administer the service.
<br>
<br>
The Company´s service automatically collects usage information,
such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and use of
the service components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many
people watched a particular show. This data is only used in the
aggregate.  This type of collective data enables us to figure out how
often customers use parts of the service, so we can make the service
appealing to as many customers as possible.  In addition, we may
provide statistical information to our partners about how our
customers, collectively, use our service. We share this type of
statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people
use their areas and our service, so that they, too, may provide you
with an optimal experience.
<br>
<br>
We also collect and use information for internal purposes. For
example, if you are a registered user of the Company´s
registration based services, we may keep records in your account
history of your use of the registration based features, and any
reported violation of our Terms of Service that you or someone
on your account may have committed.
<br>
<br>
Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites
anonymously. While Company will not be able to provide you with
a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want
you to be aware that these programs are available.
<br>
<br>
<strong>E-mail Communications:</strong>
<br>
We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from the Company
if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us
make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also send out emails
with news or promotions. If you are a registered user of the
Company´s registration-based services and do not want to receive
e-mail from us, please do not opt in to receive these emails. However,
if you do opt-in, you may later unsubscribe by following the
Company´s procedures listed at the bottom of such email.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Information From Other Sources:</strong>
<br>
For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may
receive information about you from other sources and add it to our
account information.  
<br>
<br>
<strong>What about Cookies?</strong>
<br>
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
computer´s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in
our site are visited and by how many people.  Company cookies do not
collect Personal Information, and we do not combine information
collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us
who you are or what your account name or email address is.
<br>
<br>
The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of
browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting
new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a
new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.  We strongly recommend
that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable
you to take advantage of some of Company´s most attractive
features.
<br>
<br>
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for
example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over
these cookies.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Will Company Share Any of the Information it
Receives?</strong>
<br>
We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share
your Personal Information only with the entities that are controlled
by or control the Company and as described below.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Affiliated Business We Do Not Control:</strong>
<br>
We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with
them. In certain situations, these businesses operate within the
Company´s service or sell items or services to you within the
Company´s service. In other situations, the Company provides
services, or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. You
can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with
your transaction, and we will share customer information that is
related to such transactions with that affiliated business only when
necessary.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Agents:</strong>
<br>
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf
and may need to share your information with them to provide products
or services to you.  Examples may include, sending e-mail, removing
repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing
marketing assistance, and providing customer service.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Promotional Offers:</strong>
<br>
We may send offers to certain customers on behalf of other businesses.
However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name
and address. If you are a registered user of the Company´s
subscription based services and do not wish to receive these offers,
please do not opt in to receive these emails. However, if you do
opt-in, you may later unsubscribe by following the Company´s
procedures listed at the bottom of such email.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
<br>
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets or businesses. In
these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of
the business assets that are transferred.  Moreover, if Company, or
substantially all of its assets, were acquired, customer information
would be one of the assets that are transferred.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Protection of Company and Others:</strong>
<br>
We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that
release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our
conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights,
property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and
organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
<br>
<br>
<strong>With Your Consent:</strong>
<br>
Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal
Information may be shared with third parties.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Is Information About Me Secure?</strong>
<br>
If you are a registered user, your account is protected by a password
for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against
unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing
off once you have finished using a shared computer.
