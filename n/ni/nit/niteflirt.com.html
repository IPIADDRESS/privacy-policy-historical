<p class="body">Your privacy is very important to us at Keen Â®, and Keen is 
  a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. What is TRUSTe? TRUSTe is a non-profit 
  organization dedicated to building trust in the Internet. We disclose information 
  practices to TRUSTe, which in turn operates as third-party "watch dog" 
  by auditing our privacy practices to make sure that we are in compliance with 
  TRUSTe's privacy standards. When you visit a website displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, 
  you can expect to be notified of: </p>
<ul>
  <li class="body">What personally identifiable information of yours is collected; 
  </li>
  <li class="body">What organization is collecting the information; </li>
  <li class="body">How the information is used; </li>
  <li class="body">With whom the information may be shared; </li>
  <li class="body">What choices are available to you regarding collection, use 
    and distribution of the information; </li>
  <li class="body">What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the 
    loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control; and 
  </li>
  <li class="body">How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you 
  should first contact Keen, Inc. by sending email to <a href="mailto:privacy@keen.com">privacy@keen.com</a>. 
  If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not 
  been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html. 
  TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Keen to resolve your concerns. </p>
<p class="body">This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about 
  you and what may happen to that information. Although this policy may seem long, 
  we've prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much 
  as possible about Keen's practices so that you can make an informed decision.</p>

  <a name="children"></a>1. A Special Note About Children<br>
  </span> <span class="body">Children are not eligible to use Keen and we ask 
  that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to 
  us.<br>
  </span> </p>
<p><a name="security"></a> <span class="subhead">2. Security</span><br>
  <span class="body">Keen has security measures in place to protect the loss, 
  misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We use Secure Socket 
  Layer (SSL), which digitally encrypts your information as it is transferred 
  from your computer to Keen. We have taken measures to protect user information 
  once it is received by the site, including but not limited to the following: 
  </span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="body"> limited and controlled access by employees; </li>
  <li class="body">servers and data stored in a secured location;</li>
  <li class="body"> security software where appropriate and cost effective. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="body">Employees are informed of all security protocol on a regular 
  basis, and Web security procedures are quality-assured weekly.</span> <br>
</p>
<p> <a name="information"></a><span class="subhead">3. Information Keen Collects<br>
  </span> </p>
<p> <span class="body">Our primary goal in collecting personal information from 
  you is to provide you with a smooth and efficient experience while you're using 
  Keen's website and phone services, and to keep you informed of opportunities 
  available on those services. This allows us to provide services and features 
  that are most likely to meet your needs, and to customize our service to make 
  your experience easier and quicker. </span></p>
<p class="body">When you join Keen using our online registration form, we may 
  collect an email address, Member name, password, phone number and other personal 
  information listed in the registration form. Your Member name is used throughout 
  Keen to identify you to other Members. Therefore, you should be aware that if 
  you use your real name as your Member name, this information will be visible 
  to others on the site. You can also join Keen via 800Predict.com and other co-branded 
  pages using the co-branded online registration forms available on such pages. 
  Keen will only use the information you provide to Keen by joining Keen through 
  the 800Predict.com or other co-branded online registration forms and through 
  Keen's online registration form in accordance with the Keen Privacy Policy. 
  If you register as a Member through any co-branded pages, Keen may share your 
  information with the partnering entity listed on the co-branded page. Prior 
  to completing the registration on any co-branded page, Keen will notify you 
  if your information will be shared with the partnering entity listed on the 
  co-branded page. By completing the registration on a co-branded page, you consent 
  to Keen's disclosure of your information in accordance with the notices displayed 
  during the co-branded registration process. In such event, the use of your information 
  by the partnering entity will be subject to the terms and conditions of such 
  partnering entity's privacy policy, which may be less restrictive than Keen's 
  Privacy Policy.</p>
<p> <span class="body">Because we connect Members by telephone, we require you 
  to enter a valid telephone number to connect with other Members through Keen. 
  At no time will we share your telephone number with any other Members with whom 
  you communicate. Because Keen initiates all Keen Calls, other Members cannot 
  see your telephone number -- not even with Caller ID. Although the Keen system 
  maintains the connection between the two parties, we do not monitor or record 
  the content of any Keen Calls. </span></p>
<p class="body">We may use your email, mailing addresses and phone number to contact 
  you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings, and communications 
  relevant to your use of Keen and its affiliates. If you do not wish to receive 
  mail from Keen, you have the ability to stop receiving these mail communications 
  by sending your Member name, legal name and email address via email to <a href="mailto:donotmail@keen.com">donotmail@keen.com</a>, 
  or via regular mail to Do Not Mail, Keen Inc., PMB #331, 100 First Street, Suite 
  100, San Francisco, CA 94105. If you do not wish to receive email communications 
  from Keen, you have the ability to stop receiving these email communications 
  by sending your Member name and email address to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@keen.com">unsubscribe@keen.com</a> 
  or by unchecking the box on the Personal Info page which asks if you wish to 
  receive such mailings. You can also stop receiving the email newsletter by replying 
  to the newsletter email with "unsubscribe" as the subject line. You 
  may also unsubscribe from Keen's email list by calling Keen Help at 1-877-533-6435.</p>
<p> <span class="body">You will receive administrative emails that are related 
  to the primary usage and functionality of Keen. You may not opt-out of administrative 
  emails.</span></p>
<p class="body"> If you have an Advisor listing and/or are earning money on Keen, 
  we collect additional information from you so we can process and remit to you 
  your Advisor fees and/or verify your personal and/or listing information. We 
  collect your mailing address to remit payments, and we collect your Social Security 
  number and/or Federal Tax ID number to prepare Form 1099s if necessary and to 
  help us verify your identity. We will never share this information with third 
  parties except as stated in this Privacy Policy. Members who are not United 
  States taxpayers will not be asked for their Social Security numbers or Federal 
  Tax ID numbers, though they may need to report income to their local tax authority 
  and may be required to provide equivalent evidence of their identity.</p>
<p class="body"> Keen may collect credit card information when you create an Advisor 
  listing, add money to your Keen account or use your credit card to take advantage 
  of special promotions. Keen uses a third party to process credit cards for billing 
  purposes. This third party does not store or retain any of a Member's personally 
  identifiable information. In certain cases, we will also use credit card information 
  to verify age in order to provide access to certain areas of the site and to 
  help us verify your identity. We do not charge or bill the credit card when 
  we collect credit card information for age or identity verification purposes. 
</p>
<p class="body">You can review, update and change your personally identifiable 
  information -- including your name, email address, telephone number, password 
  and PIN number -- by clicking on the Personal Info link on the My Keen page. 
  You can review, update or change your address and credit card information -- 
  if you have supplied it -- by going to the My Keen page on the Site, clicking 
  on the link to the My Account page, and then clicking on the Credit Card Information 
  link. You may correct, update or delete any of your Keen listings by clicking 
  on the My Listings link on the My Keen page. You may also update or correct 
  information by calling Keen Help at 1-877-533-6435, or you may write to Keen 
  at Keen Customer Support, Keen Inc., PMB#331, 100 First Street, Suite 100, San 
  Francisco, CA 94105.<br>
</p>
<p class="body">If you choose to include your personal information in the Keen 
  search feature, your name and email address will help others find listings you 
  have created. For example, if a person knows that a friend is a Member of Keen, 
  but doesn't know the friend's Member name, that person can search for any listings 
  that the friend has created by typing in the friend's first name, last name, 
  or email address in the search field. We will never disclose Member names or 
  email addresses during the search process unless you choose to make this information 
  available, and you can remove yourself from the search feature by clicking on 
  the Personal Info link from the My Keen page.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="body">You may also provide Keen with additional profile information 
  (such as experience, credentials, affiliations, on-call schedule, etc.) that 
  is displayed publicly on the Site, on your home page or in your listings. Other 
  than the profile information submitted by our Members, and except as noted herein, 
  Keen does not disclose any personally identifying information to other Members 
  without your permission.<br>
  </span> </p>
<p class="body">Keen's Tell a Friend Program allows Members to earn money by referring 
  their friends to our Site. The third party contact information you enter as 
  part of Keen's Tell a Friend program will be used only to personalize a one-time 
  referral email sent to your friends.</p>
<p class="body"> We use information we maintain about you, and other information 
  we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve disputes, 
  identify potential liabilities, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Member 
  Agreement. At times, we may look at your account information and transaction 
  history to identify problems or resolve disputes. Moreover, such information 
  is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints 
  and the fact we back up our systems. Therefore, our Members' personally identifiable 
  information may not be completely removed from our databases in response to 
  Member requests.</p>
<p class="body"> We may from time to time run promotions in which we ask visitors 
  for demographic information (like their zip code, state/province or age). We 
  may also run contests on Keen in which we ask visitors for demographic information. 
  We use this data to tailor your experience, showing content that we think you 
  might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. 
  We also use demographic information to determine eligibility for certain contests.</p>
<p><span class="body"> From time to time Keen may ask Members to participate in 
  surveys. Such surveys may ask visitors for contact information (like their email 
  address). We use contact data from our surveys to send information about our 
  company. </span> </p>
<p class="body">In order to enhance your listings, you may <a href="/secure/credentials/credentials_agreement.asp">verify</a> 
  your professional and academic credentials through <a href="http://www.absolutebackgrounds.com">AbsoluteBackgrounds.com</a>, 
  a leading provider of comprehensive background checks on individuals. You may 
  submit information to be verified by AbsoluteBackgrounds.com (such as academic 
  degrees and professional licenses) on the Keen website. All information submitted 
  as part of the verification program is subject to the agreement between the 
  Member and <a href="http://www.absolutebackgrounds.com">AbsoluteBackgrounds.com</a> 
  (or such other verification program as Keen may use), which may contain terms 
  that differ from Keen's Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="body"> Keen may contain links to other sites. Keen is not responsible 
  for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We encourage you 
  to review the policies of these sites.</p>
<p class="body"> Keen also facilitates communication among Members through our 
  on-site Keen Mail system. Messages sent via Keen Mail are identified only by 
  your Member name, and we do not reveal either Member's personal e-mail address 
  in such messages.</p>
<p class="body"> Keen may use certain information collected from our Members in 
  aggregate form to tailor our Members' experience at the Site, showing you content 
  that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according 
  to your preferences. Keen may also supplement the information you provide by 
  purchasing information relating to you from third party data providers. Keen 
  uses this information to improve its marketing and promotional efforts.</p>
<p> <span class="body">Keen uses cookies. Cookies are small amounts of data sent 
  to a user's browser from the Keen Web servers and stored on a user's computer's 
  hard drive. Keen uses cookies to track the pages on the Site that our users 
  have visited. This allows us to collect aggregate information about usage on 
  the Site. Keen may also use cookies to deliver content specific to Members' 
  interests, and to keep track of Members' Member names and passwords so that 
  Members do not have to reenter them during a session. If you choose not to accept 
  cookies, you will be unable to use the Keen website.</span></p>
<p class="body"> Keen uses your IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our 
  server and to administer the Site. Generally, IP addresses tell us the location 
  from which a person is connecting to us, what service provider the person is 
  using, and which parts of the Site the User is visiting. We do not link IP addresses 
  to anything personally identifiable. This means that your session will be tracked, 
  but you will remain anonymous. We reserve the right to track IP addresses for 
  the purposes of fraud prevention, and we reserve the right to release IP addresses 
  to legal authorities.</p>
<p class="body"> If you send Keen email correspondence, or if other Members or 
  other third parties send us email or other correspondence regarding a particular 
  Member's activities or postings on the Site, Keen may collect such information.</p>
<p> <a name="disclosure"></a><span class="subhead">4. Our Disclosure of Your Information.</span></p>
<p class="body"> We do not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifiable information 
  to third parties. In addition to the other circumstances of disclosure described 
  in this Privacy Policy, Keen may disclose your personally identifiable information 
  to third parties if you opt-in to having your personally identifiable information 
  disclosed to such parties. When you consent to disclosure to such third parties, 
  such third parties may use your information in accordance with their privacy 
  policies, which may be less restrictive than Keen's Privacy Policy. Keen may 
  also disclose your personal information to appropriate authorities and to banks 
  associated with your account in order to prevent or report suspected fraud and 
  illegal activities, in order to prevent harm to any persons, or if Keen believes 
  in good faith that the law requires it. In some cases, the government can compel 
  the disclosure of information about you, and Keen will need to comply, in which 
  case you authorize it to do so. You also consent to Keen disclosing information 
  about you in connection with disputes involving other Members, and to actual 
  or potential parties to a lawsuit or action that Keen is or may become involved 
  in (a) if it required to do so, (b) if it reasonably believes that such disclosures 
  will potentially mitigate its liability, or (c) to enforce its rights. Keen 
  may disclose some personally identifiable information to vendors and third party 
  service providers in connection with communications and payments to Members 
  and other aspects of operating and promoting Keen's Site and services. For example, 
  Keen uses a third-party newsletter company to deliver Keen newsletters, and 
  we share your email address with this newsletter company. Third parties will 
  be under extensive confidentiality restrictions.</p>
<p class="body"> Keen may also exchange personally identifiable information with 
  its subsidiaries worldwide. If you are registering on keen.co.uk or other sites 
  controlled by Keen affiliated entities located in the European Union, your personally 
  identifiable information must be disclosed to Keen affiliates outside of the 
  European Union in order to allow Members worldwide to contact and be contacted 
  by you. Therefore, you acknowledge and consent to the sharing of your personally 
  identifiable information with Keen, Inc. and its subsidiaries worldwide. </p>
