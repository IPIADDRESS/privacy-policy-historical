  <h2 class="lead">Privacy policy</h2>
  <div id="body_content">
    <p class="large">At Nitro PDF we are committed to ensuring the privacy
      of your personal information. We understand that privacy of your personal
      information is important. As part of our commitment to good privacy practice
      we have adopted the Australian National Privacy Principles prescribed by
      the Privacy Act (Cth) 1988. Our Privacy Policy tells you how we collect,
      use, distribute and protect personal information.</p>
	<h3>Information we collect</h3> 
    <p class="large">The types of information we collect and handle normally comprises:<br>
	</p><ul>
	  <li>Identity and contact details </li>
	  <li>Product &amp; service preferences </li>
	</ul>
    <p class="large">Normally, we collect your personal information from you but on occasions
      we may obtain information about you from others. </p>
    <p class="large">We only collect information which is necessary for the purposes of your
      dealings with us. We do not collect information about anyone's political
      or religious beliefs, ethnic background, criminal history or sexual preferences.</p>
	<h3>Purpose of collection &amp; use of personal information</h3> 
    <p class="large">The purpose for which we collect this information is to assist us in providing
      you with the products and services you have requested. We will not use
      your personal information for any purpose which is not related to the products
      or services you have requested or for any purpose which you would not reasonably
      expect us to use the information.</p>
    <p class="large">We will not disclose information about you to anyone else unless the disclosure:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>is required by law; or </li>
	  <li>is authorised by law (for example to protect our interest or where we have
      a duty to the public to disclose that information); or </li>
	  <li>has been consented to by you. </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Quality &amp; correction</h3> 
    <p class="large">As the information we hold about you is important to decisions we make
      about the products and services which we provide to you, we strive to ensure
      that the information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date. To assist
      us, you should let us know if you find that the personal information we
      hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date. We will use all
      reasonable efforts to correct the information.</p>
	<h3>Access</h3> 
    <p class="large">You may request that we provide you with access to the personal information
      we hold about you at any time. Generally we will be able to provide you
      with such access. However, where: </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>the access impacts on the privacy of others; </li>
	  <li>the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; </li>
	  <li>there are existing or anticipated legal proceedings </li>
	  <li>such access can be denied under law or by law enforcement agency; or </li>
	  <li>where the information is evaluative. </li>
	</ul>
    <p class="large">We may not be able to provide you with access to such information.
      If we deny your request for access, we will let you know why.
      We may also charge a fee to cover our reasonable costs associated with
      your request.</p>
	<h3>Personal information security</h3> 
    <p class="large">We will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information
      from loss, misuse or alteration. This includes both physical and technological
      security measures.</p>
