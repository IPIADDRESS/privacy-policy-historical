            Business Transitions

            Access</h2>
        <p>
            You may request that we provide you with access to the personal information we hold
            about you at any time. We will respond to your request for access within 30 days.

            <li>the access impacts on the privacy of others; </li>
            <li>the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; </li>
            <li>there are existing or anticipated legal proceedings </li>
            <li>such access can be denied under law or by law enforcement agency; or </li>

            We may not be able to provide you with access to such information. If we deny your
