 <h3>
            Business Transitions
        </h3>

            You may request that we provide you with access to the personal information we hold
            about you at any time. We will respond to your request for access within 30 days.
            If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire

            we will be able to provide you with such access. However, where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the access impacts on the privacy of others; </li>
            <li>the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; </li>
            <li>there are existing or anticipated legal proceedings </li>
            <li>such access can be denied under law or by law enforcement agency; or </li>

        <p>
            We may not be able to provide you with access to such information. If we deny your

            As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store
            it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser
            type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
            stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual
            users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around
            the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We
            do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information</p>

            Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
        </h3>
        <p>
            We and our third party advertising partner employ a software technology called clear
            gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site
            by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
            identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements
            of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard
            drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of
            the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by
            clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p>
            We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web
            site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies
            and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities
            on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your
            interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving
            you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here: <a href="http://preferences.truste.com">
                http://preferences.truste.com/</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of
            being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
