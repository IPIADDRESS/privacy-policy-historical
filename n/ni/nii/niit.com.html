The following terms and conditions apply to all visitors to or users of this Web Site. By accessing this Web Site, the user acknowledges acceptance of these terms and conditions.
</p>
<p><b>
1. Introduction</b>
</p>
<p>
NIIT Limited ("NIIT") is committed to respecting your privacy and distinguishes your need for appropriate safety of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with NIIT.&nbsp;<br>
NIIT has created privacy policies in order to demonstrate its commitment to privacy. Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, addresses including an e-mail address or other contact details. In general, you can visit NIIT's Wweb pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Your use of an NIIT Web site signifies your acceptance of the NIIT Privacy Statement.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
NIIT strives to comply with applicable laws that are designed to protect your privacy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>
2. NIIT's Principles to protect Privacy&nbsp;<br>
</b>
<br>
In order to protect your privacy, NIIT has adopted the following principles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)	Security&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)	Choice&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)	Notice&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d)	Access/Accuracy
</p>
<p><br>
<b><font color="#0000FF">(a) Security<br>
</font></b>
Wherever your Personal Information may be held within NIIT, the company  intends to take reasonable steps to protect  it from  unauthorized access or disclosure.&nbsp;<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>
(b) Choice<br>
</b></font>
You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to NIIT. The notice NIIT  intends to provide at the point where it collects Personal Information on the Site, should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of NIIT's Web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you chose to have a relationship with NIIT, such as a contractual or other business relationship, NIIT will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.&nbsp;<br>
<b><font color="#0000FF">
(c) Notice</font></b><br>
Where NIIT collects Personal Information on the Site, NIIT intends to post a purpose statement that explains why Personal Information will be collected and whether NIIT plans to share such Personal Information outside of NIIT or with those working on NIIT's behalf. Unless the transfer of Personal Information is legally required, NIIT does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your permission to third parties who are not bound to act on NIIT's behalf.&nbsp;<br>
<b><font color="#0000FF">
(d) Access/Accuracy</font></b><br>
To the extent that you do provide NIIT with Personal Information, NIIT wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where NIIT collects Personal Information from you on the Site, its aim is to provide a means of contacting NIIT should you need to update or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your Personal Information to privacy@NIIT.com and NIIT  will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#0000FF">
Your Consent</font></b><br>
<br>
By using this Web site, you consent to the terms of NIITs Privacy Policy and to NIIT's processing of Personal Information for the purposes given above.&nbsp;<br>
There are times, however, when NIIT may need information from you, such as your name and address. When information is needed, NIIT will try (but is not obligated) to let you know at the time of collection, how it will use the personal information. Usually, the personal information NIIT collects is used only by it to respond to your inquiry, process an order or allow you to access specific account information. Occasionally, NIIT may make the e-mail addresses, of those who provide information, available to other reputable organizations whose products or services it thinks you may find interesting. In these cases, you will be offered an opportunity to limit access to your information. In case NIIT does not receive any response from you to limit the access of your information, it shall be deemed that you consent to such distribution of your Personal Information as mentioned above.<br>
