<h2>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information.</h2>
<p>Night Out, Inc. collects two types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an account, or purchasing or using a Deal or other products or services from the Site, submitting any type of content and/or posting content or comments, sharing, filling out a survey, sending us feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website (collectively, "Identification Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity on the Site. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, city of residence, zip code, email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you purchase Deals or other products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date, billing address and authentication codes or related information. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is indicated as Required and some is identified as optional. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>Night Out, Inc. uses Personally Identifiable Information to provide you with products and services, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, send you information and news, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</p>
<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</p>
</div>
<div class="term-section">
<h2>3. Release of Personally Identifiable Information.</h2>
<p>We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:</p>

Merchants") who, as part of the offer, request information on Night Out, Inc. customers who purchased the offer in order to aid redemption. In those cases, we share some of your Personally Identifiable Information with Night Out, Inc Merchants. Sharing this Information may allow a Night Out, Inc. Merchant to market directly to you should they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information with a Night Out, Inc. Merchant if you engage in an Identification Activity, and then only to the Night Out Inc. Merchant involved in that Identification Activity. We specifically disclaim any and all responsibility or liability for the actions of such Night Out, Inc. Merchant. We inform them that they are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotions that relate to your involvement with Night Out, Inc., we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the Night Out, Inc.
