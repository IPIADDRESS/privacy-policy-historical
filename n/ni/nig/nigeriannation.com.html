<div class="panel-body">


 <p>
  This Privacy Policy is 
  intended to inform you of NigerianNation's policies and practices regarding the 
  collection, use and disclosure of any Personal Information you submit to us 
  through our Website.<br>
  <br>
  NigerianNation ("NigerianNation", "us" or "we") respects the privacy of the visitors 
  to its Website, the home page of which is located at http://www.nigeriannation.com 
  ("Website"). <br>
  <br>
"Personal Information" is information about you that is personally identifiable 
  to you, like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as 
  other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.<br>
  <br>
"Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with or linked 
  to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification 
  of individual persons. We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous 
  Information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>User Consent</strong><br>
  By submitting Personal Information through our Website, you agree to the terms 
  of this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to the processing of your Personal 
  Information according to this Privacy Policy. <br>
  Your Personal Information may be processed by NigerianNation in the country where 
  it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States of 
  America) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less 
  stringent than the laws in your country.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>General </strong><br>
  We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through our 
  Website.<br>
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>When you register for 
	the NigerianNation network, we will collect your name, e-mail address, your 
	gender, date of birth and ZIP code.</li>
  <li>When you save other 
	Personal Information in your profile we will collect any such information 
	you enter.</li>
  <li>When you enter Personal 
	Information throughout the NigerianNation network using one of the features 
	of the NigerianNation network, for example journals, testimonials, groups, or 
	message boards, we will collect any such information you enter ("Publicly 
	Posted Information").</li>
  <li>When you contact us 
	by sending us an e-mail, we will collect your e-mail addresses and any information 
	contained in the e-mail you send us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you register with 
  NigerianNation and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. If you 
  are browsing the Website without registering with NigerianNation, you are anonymous 
  to us, but we will collect the information listed below under Personal Information 
  Collected Via Technology. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Use of information</strong><br>
  Any visitor of the NigerianNation website can view your profile information and 
  photos that you have uploaded to the NigerianNation community. You can control 
  what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the 
  NigerianNation website and which network of NigerianNation members can see what 
  information. </p>
<p>To provide you with some 
  of the features that the NigerianNation community offers to its members, we may 
  use Personal Information that is stored in your profile after you have requested 
  such features, for example to send invitation e-mails to people that you specified 
  as being interested in joining the NigerianNation community. In order to provide 
  useful information about social networks to people who might be interested in 
  joining the NigerianNation community, we may use your profile information and 
  photos on the NigerianNation website and when we send emails, for example when 
  we send birthday reminders to NigerianNation members or when we send general newsletters 
  to members of the NigerianNation community. When you decide to view a member's 
  profile, we may show that NigerianNation member that you chose to view their profile. 
  If you don't want us to show to other NigerianNation members that you viewed their 
  profile, you can change this in your privacy settings.</p>
<p> If you decide to use certain 
  features of the NigerianNation network (like journals, testimonials, groups, message 
  boards and the like), some of the Personal Information you entered into your 
  NigerianNation profile and any information, including Personal Information, that 
  you enter using one of these features, might be used and displayed.<br>
  NigerianNation members can use the search feature to search for other members 
  by different criteria, like location or gender. The Personal Information that 
  NigerianNation members enter into the NigerianNation profile will be used for these 
  searches.<br>
  Please be aware that any information that is publicly posted throughout the 
  NigerianNation network can be accessed by every visitor of the Website.</p>
<p> NigerianNation may analyze 
  any collected information for its own internal purposes. In addition, NigerianNation 
  may remove personally identifying information from collected information to 
  render it anonymous. NigerianNation may use Anonymous Information for any purpose 
  and disclose Anonymous Information in its discretion.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>
  NigerianNation does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with 
  other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services 
  you've requested, when we have your permission, or as otherwise described in 
  this privacy policy. <br>
  <br>
  We provide your Personal Information to third party service providers who work 
  on behalf of or with NigerianNation under confidentiality agreements to provide 
  some of the services and features of the NigerianNation community and to help 
  us communicate with NigerianNation members. These service providers may use your 
  personal information to help NigerianNation communicate with you about offers 
  from NigerianNation and our marketing partners. However, these service providers 
  do not have any independent right to share this information.<br>
  <br>
  If you decide to use one of the additional services that are offered by our 
  partners, such as the e-mail finder service or the electronic fax, we may forward 
  Personal Information to these partners to enable them to provide the services 
  that you requested.<br>
  We also provide information to third-party advertising companies, as described 
  in the next section.<br>
  Please be aware that the handling of your Personal Information by our partners 
  or the third-party advertising companies is governed by their privacy policy, 
  not ours.<br>
  <br>
  If you would like to know (1) the categories of Personal Information about you 
  that we disclosed in the prior calendar year to third parties for the purposes 
  of the third partiesý marketing and/or (2) the names and addresses of such third 
  parties, please contact us.<br>
  <br>
  We will disclose information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal 
  process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal 
  claims. We may disclose information, if we believe it is necessary to investigate, 
  prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations 
  involving the physical safety of any person, violations of NigerianNation's terms 
  of use, or as otherwise required by applicable law. <br>
  <br>
  If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will 
  possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights 
  and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy 
  Policy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</strong><br>
  As you navigate the Website, certain information may also be passively collected 
  and stored on our server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser 
  type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform 
  Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of 
  your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, 
  or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Website you clicked. This 
  type of information is collected to make our services and solutions more useful 
  to you and to tailor the NigerianNation community experience to meet your special 
  interests and needs.<br>
  If you search the NigerianNation community by using a toolbar that NigerianNation, 
  or a third party provides, we may collect Anonymous Information about you automatically, 
  but we will not collect Personal Information.<br>
  <br>
  An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically 
  assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address 
  stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer 
  internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. 
  We track your IP Address when you login to the Website.<br>
  <br>
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computerýs 
  hard drive while you are viewing a web site. NigerianNation may use both session 
  Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies 
  (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more 
  personal and interactive experience on the Website. Persistent Cookies can be 
  removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose 
  to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.<br>
  Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on webpages within 
  the NigerianNation network. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to 
  their own privacy policies, not this one.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences  </strong><br>
  We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the NigerianNation 
  service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the NigerianNation 
  Newsletter, that are considered part of your NigerianNation account. If you would 
  like to opt out of these messages, you may delete your account by sending an 
  e-mail message to support@NigerianNation, subject: account deletion. Please include 
  your full name, e-mail address in the body of the message.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Confidentiality and Security </strong><br>
  We limit access to personal information about you to employees and third parties 
  who we reasonably believe need access to that information to provide products 
  or services to you or in order to do their jobs. <br>
  <br>
  We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal 
  information about you and your NigerianNation account information is protected 
  by a password that you select. NigerianNation uses industry-standard SSL encryption 
  in certain areas of the Website to protect data transmissions.<br>
  However, no company, including NigerianNation, can fully eliminate security risks 
  associated with Personal Information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Other Sites</strong><br>
  Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience 
  and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its 
  contents. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible 
  for these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms 
  of our Privacy Policy does not apply to these outside websites.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Regarding Children</strong><br>
  We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors who are under 
  the age of 13. <br>

  NigerianNation may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you about 
  significant changes in the way we treat Personal Information by sending a notice 
  to the primary email address specified in your NigerianNation account or by placing 
  a prominent notice on our Website. If you object to any such changes, you must 
  cease using our Website. Continued use of our Website following notice of any 
  such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement 
  to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.<br>
