<p>
This Privacy Policy is
intended to inform you of NigerianNation's policies and practices regarding the
collection, use and disclosure of any Personal Information you submit to us
through our Website.<br>
<br>
NigerianNation ("NigerianNation", "us" or "we") respects the privacy of the visitors
to its Website, the home page of which is located at http://www.nigeriannation.com
("Website"). <br>
<br>
"Personal Information" is information about you that is personally identifiable
to you, like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as
other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.<br>
<br>
"Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with or linked
to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification
of individual persons. We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous
Information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>User Consent</strong><br>
By submitting Personal Information through our Website, you agree to the terms
of this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to the processing of your Personal
Information according to this Privacy Policy. <br>
Your Personal Information may be processed by NigerianNation in the country where
it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States of
America) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less
stringent than the laws in your country.<br>
<br>
<strong>General </strong><br>
We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through our
Website.<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>When you register for
the NigerianNation network, we will collect your name, e-mail address, your
gender, date of birth and ZIP code.</li>
<li>When you save other
Personal Information in your profile we will collect any such information
you enter.</li>
<li>When you enter Personal
Information throughout the NigerianNation network using one of the features
of the NigerianNation network, for example journals, testimonials, groups, or
message boards, we will collect any such information you enter ("Publicly
Posted Information").</li>
<li>When you contact us
by sending us an e-mail, we will collect your e-mail addresses and any information
contained in the e-mail you send us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you register with
NigerianNation and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. If you
are browsing the Website without registering with NigerianNation, you are anonymous
to us, but we will collect the information listed below under Personal Information
Collected Via Technology. <br>
<br>
<strong>Use of information</strong><br>
Any visitor of the NigerianNation website can view your profile information and
photos that you have uploaded to the NigerianNation community. You can control
what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the
NigerianNation website and which network of NigerianNation members can see what
information. </p>
<p>To provide you with some
of the features that the NigerianNation community offers to its members, we may
use Personal Information that is stored in your profile after you have requested
such features, for example to send invitation e-mails to people that you specified
as being interested in joining the NigerianNation community. In order to provide
useful information about social networks to people who might be interested in
joining the NigerianNation community, we may use your profile information and
photos on the NigerianNation website and when we send emails, for example when
we send birthday reminders to NigerianNation members or when we send general newsletters
to members of the NigerianNation community. When you decide to view a member's
profile, we may show that NigerianNation member that you chose to view their profile.
If you don't want us to show to other NigerianNation members that you viewed their
profile, you can change this in your privacy settings.</p>
<p> If you decide to use certain
features of the NigerianNation network (like journals, testimonials, groups, message
boards and the like), some of the Personal Information you entered into your
NigerianNation profile and any information, including Personal Information, that
you enter using one of these features, might be used and displayed.<br>
NigerianNation members can use the search feature to search for other members
by different criteria, like location or gender. The Personal Information that
NigerianNation members enter into the NigerianNation profile will be used for these
searches.<br>
Please be aware that any information that is publicly posted throughout the
NigerianNation network can be accessed by every visitor of the Website.</p>
<p> NigerianNation may analyze
any collected information for its own internal purposes. In addition, NigerianNation
may remove personally identifying information from collected information to
render it anonymous. NigerianNation may use Anonymous Information for any purpose
and disclose Anonymous Information in its discretion.<br>
<br>
<strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>
NigerianNation does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with
other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services
you've requested, when we have your permission, or as otherwise described in
this privacy policy. <br>
<br>
We provide your Personal Information to third party service providers who work
on behalf of or with NigerianNation under confidentiality agreements to provide
some of the services and features of the NigerianNation community and to help
us communicate with NigerianNation members. These service providers may use your
personal information to help NigerianNation communicate with you about offers
from NigerianNation and our marketing partners. However, these service providers
do not have any independent right to share this information.<br>
<br>
If you decide to use one of the additional services that are offered by our
partners, such as the e-mail finder service or the electronic fax, we may forward
Personal Information to these partners to enable them to provide the services
that you requested.<br>
We also provide information to third-party advertising companies, as described
in the next section.<br>
Please be aware that the handling of your Personal Information by our partners
or the third-party advertising companies is governed by their privacy policy,
not ours.<br>
<br>
If you would like to know (1) the categories of Personal Information about you
that we disclosed in the prior calendar year to third parties for the purposes
of the third partiesý marketing and/or (2) the names and addresses of such third
parties, please contact us.<br>
<br>
We will disclose information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal
process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
claims. We may disclose information, if we believe it is necessary to investigate,
prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations
involving the physical safety of any person, violations of NigerianNation's terms
of use, or as otherwise required by applicable law. <br>
<br>
If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will
possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights
and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy
Policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp <br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</strong><br>
As you navigate the Website, certain information may also be passively collected
and stored on our server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser
type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform
Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of
your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed,
or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Website you clicked. This
type of information is collected to make our services and solutions more useful
to you and to tailor the NigerianNation community experience to meet your special
interests and needs.<br>
If you search the NigerianNation community by using a toolbar that NigerianNation,
or a third party provides, we may collect Anonymous Information about you automatically,
but we will not collect Personal Information.<br>
<br>
An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically
assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address
stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer
internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session.
We track your IP Address when you login to the Website.<br>
<br>
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computerýs
hard drive while you are viewing a web site. NigerianNation may use both session
Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies
(which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more
personal and interactive experience on the Website. Persistent Cookies can be
removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose
to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.<br>
Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on webpages within
the NigerianNation network. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to
their own privacy policies, not this one.<br>
<br>
<strong>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences </strong><br>
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the NigerianNation
service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the NigerianNation
Newsletter, that are considered part of your NigerianNation account. If you would
like to opt out of these messages, you may delete your account by sending an
e-mail message to support@NigerianNation, subject: account deletion. Please include
your full name, e-mail address in the body of the message.<br>
<br>
<strong>Confidentiality and Security </strong><br>
We limit access to personal information about you to employees and third parties
who we reasonably believe need access to that information to provide products
or services to you or in order to do their jobs. <br>
<br>
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal
information about you and your NigerianNation account information is protected
by a password that you select. NigerianNation uses industry-standard SSL encryption
in certain areas of the Website to protect data transmissions.<br>
However, no company, including NigerianNation, can fully eliminate security risks
associated with Personal Information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Other Sites</strong><br>
Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience
and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its
contents. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible
for these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms
of our Privacy Policy does not apply to these outside websites.<br>
<br>
<strong>Regarding Children</strong><br>
We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors who are under
the age of 13. <br>
<br>
<strong>Contact Us</strong><br>
Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please
<a href="/contacts/default.aspx">contact us</a>.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
NigerianNation may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you about
significant changes in the way we treat Personal Information by sending a notice
to the primary email address specified in your NigerianNation account or by placing
a prominent notice on our Website. If you object to any such changes, you must
cease using our Website. Continued use of our Website following notice of any
such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement
to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.<br>
