<p>
Your right to privacy is a priority to us at National Instruments. We recognize your need for reasonable control of information that you share with NI. Therefore, this statement is a corporate-wide guideline, and is not limited to our online business. We do not sell your information to outside organizations. Our goal in gathering information is to consistently improve our relationship with you, our customer.
</p>
<p>
We use the following guidelines to protect the information we collect during your visit to our Web site, ni.com, over the telephone, at trade shows, or through any other interaction. Because these guidelines affect information about you, please read them carefully and <a href="#10">contact us</a> if you have any questions or concerns. 
</p>

<strong>What information does NI gather online?</strong><br>
Every time you visit ni.com, we automatically collect information such as your IP address -- the Internet address of your computer, the Web page from which you came, and a record of your activity on our site. We use this information to learn more about general trends in traffic patterns on ni.com so we can improve our Web site. National Instruments does not use this information to identify you personally.
</p>
<p>
One of the tools we use to analyze traffic to ni.com is WebTrends On Demand. You should refer to the WebTrends On Demand Privacy Policy to learn how they collect and use information. You can find WebTrends On Demand Privacy Policy here: <a href="https://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp" target="_blank">https://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a name="2"></a>
For some areas of our site, we ask you to provide additional information that helps us enhance your site visit, assist you with technical support issues, or permit post-visit follow-up. You provide this information to us only once, by creating a ni.com profile. This information might include your name, e-mail address, company information, mailing address, application information, product preferences, or contact preferences. <a href="/profile/">Learn more details</a> about your ni.com profile and its benefits.
</p>
<p>
<a name="3"></a>
<strong>How does NI use information collected about me?</strong><br>
We use the information we receive from you to tailor your ni.com experience and provide you with the specific information or services you are seeking. This information remains confidential. With the information you volunteer, we can process your purchases, confirm your orders, customize the page content and language, notify you of updates to our site and products, and provide you with specific product and local event information. We add any information you provide to our customer database. Therefore, you may receive periodic mailings, e-mails, or telephone calls from us about new products and services, discounts, special promotions, or upcoming events. Information added to our customer database is aggregated with other information previously collected. 
</p>
<p>
At any time, you can change the information we have stored in our customer database or request not to be contacted. See "<a href="#6">How can I update my information?</a>" or visit the <a href="/unsubscribe/">communication preferences</a> area of your profile. If you do not have a ni.com profile, visit <a href="/remove/">ni.com/remove</a> to update your communications preferences. Please give four to six weeks for these changes to take effect in our internal customer databases.

<strong>How does NI use cookies?</strong><br>
A cookie is a small file, typically only a few bytes, placed on your computer's hard drive. If you agree, then your browser adds the text in a small file. At NI, we primarily use cookies to tailor a Web application to you. We also use cookies to help us analyze Web traffic. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, a Web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes, and dislikes. For example, when you visit the Products and Services area of ni.com, a cookie remembers which currency to display in subsequent visits based on the country of origin you select. A cookie also makes it easy to shop online because with it, you can add items to a shopping cart. The cookie is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of your cart and the items in it versus other carts in use at the same time.
</p>
<p>
By accepting cookies, we do not gain access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you chose to share with us. <strong>We do not store any personal information in the cookies we place on your computer.</strong> This practice is strictly enforced. In talking with many of our customers, we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile. To learn more about cookies, how we use them, and how you can view or delete them, refer to our <a href="/help/cookies.htm">Cookies Help</a> page.
</p>
<p>
<a name="5"></a>
<strong>How do I know my information is secure?</strong><br>
We have invested time and resources to ensure that our online and internal security procedures help safeguard your information. When you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window, your connection with our site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Learn more about our online <a href="javascript:popUp('https://sine.ni.com/apps/utf8/nilp.display_page?p_name=NIOS_POPUP_SECURITY');">security measures</a>. We use industry-standard encryption technologies, such as SSL, when transferring and receiving your personal information on our site. Pages requesting personal information should always have one of these icons. If you do not see one of these icons, please contact NI to complete your transaction over the phone. Credit card information is only used for processing payment and is not used for other purposes. 
</p>
<p>
If you do not feel comfortable submitting your payment information online, we do offer a <a href="javascript:popUp('/popup/products/us/frameset/payment.htm');">print and fax</a> purchasing option by which you can print the contents of your shopping cart and fax your order to us. You also can contact us to place your order via phone, fax, or e-mail.
</p>
<p>
<a name="6"></a>
<strong>Is my information shared with third parties?</strong><br>
To keep your information confidential, NI does not release your personal information, except as we describe below or as required by law. We only use the personal information we collect to support and develop your relationship with NI, our affiliates, and our strategic business partners. Some of these partners and affiliates may be located in other countries.
</p>
<p>
<em>NI Alliance Program</em><br>
Because our <a href="/alliance/">Alliance Program</a> members are specialized experts, we may ask an Alliance Program member to contact you regarding a service or product you request. In this case, we share only the appropriate information with the Alliance Program members or other integrators.  The Alliance Program member then contacts you regarding your request.
</p>
<p>
<em>NI Partners</em><br>
In addition, NI occasionally partners with other companies in an effort to provide the most relevant and detailed information for your measurement and automation application. On ni.com, this partnership can take place via online advisors, such as <a href="http://sine.ni.com/apps/we/nipc.specs?action=search&amp;asid=1102">Camera Advisor</a> and <a href="/devzone/advisors/motion/">Motor and Stage Advisor</a>. Or this partnership could result from joint seminars. In this situation, expect us to conduct some joint marketing activities and enter your personal information in our customer database. In addition, we may provide your information to these third parties so they may mail you information about a joint activity.
</p>
<p>
<em>Third-Party Mailings</em><br>
We only agree to third-party mailings that we think will benefit your measurement and automation application. However, you do have the option to remove yourself solely from non-NI third-party joint marketing activities without limiting your option to receive information from NI. See "How can I update my information?" or visit the <a href="/unsubscribe/">communication preferences</a> area of your profile. If you do not have a ni.com profile, visit <a href="/remove/">ni.com/remove</a> to change your communications preferences.
</p>
<p>
NI reserves the right to release any information about you to protect our systems or business. Also, we can release personal information when we reasonably believe you to be in violation of our current or later Web site <a href="/legal/termsofuse/unitedstates/us/">Terms of Use</a> or other published guidelines, or reasonably believe you to have initiated or participated in any illegal activity. We can release this information without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and other legal requirements.
</p>
<p>
<a name="7"></a>
<strong>How can I update my information or remove myself from your customer database?</strong><br>
To change or update your personal information, remove yourself from our customer database, or remove yourself from certain provisions of this privacy statement, visit the <a href="/unsubscribe/">communication preferences</a> area of your profile. If you do not have a ni.com profile, visit <a href="/remove/">ni.com/remove</a> to update your communications preferences.
</p>
<p>
If you do not have a ni.com profile, you can create one at <a href="/profile/">ni.com/profile</a>. Here, learn more details about your ni.com profile and its benefits.
</p>
<p>
If you have any difficulty updating your <a href="/unsubscribe/">communications preferences</a> on ni.com, e-mail <a href="mailto:webmaster@ni.com">webmaster@ni.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
Please give four to six weeks for these changes to take effect in our internal customer databases. Note, your information cannot be completely "deleted" from our database. Although NI complies with your request to be removed in whole or in part by blocking your information, there will be residual information that remains within our database and other internal records, which may or may not contain such personal information.
</p>
<p>
<a name="8"></a>
<strong>How does the NI privacy statement affect me outside the U.S.?</strong><br>
To the extent applicable, NI attempts to comply with local data protection rights laws. If you are unsure whether this privacy statement is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should not submit your information. IF YOU ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, WHICH IS DEEMED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION.  We have made an effort to add greater protection.  Nevertheless, in accordance with local laws implementing European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ("EU Privacy Directive"), customers located in countries outside of the United States of America who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Statement and to its transfer to and/or storage in the United States of America.
</p>
<p>
<a name="9"></a>
<strong>Is my information public in the public forum?</strong><br>
Please remember that any information (including personal information) that you disclose in public areas of our Web site, such as the Alliance Program, <a href="http://forums.ni.com/">NI Discussion Forums</a>, chat rooms, forums, and/or message boards, or other public forums such as tradeshows or conventions, becomes public information that others may collect, circulate, and use. By using an Alias in NI Developer Exchange, you do not reveal any personal information. However, any text you include in a message is public. Because NI cannot and does not control the acts of others, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose information about yourself or others in public forums such as these.
</p>
<p>
<a name="10"></a>
<strong>Does NI maintain third-party Web site links?</strong><br>
Any links to third-party Web sites are provided on ni.com as a benefit to you, however a third party controls them. NI uses certain application service providers (ASPs) to provide specific services to enhance your online experience. ASPs do not sell or distribute your personal information. They are bound by the NI Privacy Policy. ASPs provide these services through their Web site, although the look and feel of the site matches ni.com. If you are interested in learning which ASPs NI uses and for what services, please e-mail <a href="mailto:webmaster@ni.com">webmaster@ni.com</a>. For more information on third-party Web sites, you are encouraged to visit our <a href="/legal/termsofuse/unitedstates/us/">Terms of Use</a>.
