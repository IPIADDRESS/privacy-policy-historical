		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Ningin.com is part of the Mixr Media, LLC family of websites. This Privacy Policy applies to all registered users of Ningin.com and the Mixr Media Network. </p>

			<h3>Overall Privacy Statement.</h3>
			<p>Mixr Media take your privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. These privacy practices apply to the Web site that you were viewing when you clicked through to this policy, which is operated directly by us, by our partner, or by our affiliate. By using the Ningin website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. </p>

			<h3>What information does Mixr Media collect?</h3>
			<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services. Several of the services and features that we offer on our sites require you to provide us with information as a condition of usage. These include the ability to post opinions or other content, participation in sweepstakes or contests, subscriptions to email newsletters and participation in message boards.</p>

			<p>Depending on how you use the sites in the Mixr Media Network, the information collected my include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, postal code, age when you provide it to us.</li>
				<li>Sensitive information such as your gender, username and password. </li>
				<li>General information about your visits to Mixr Media sites and pages, the searches you perform through the Mixr Media Network, and the Mixr Media services or offerings that you use.</li>
				<li>We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you provided to us.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Once you register with one of our Mixr Media sites you are no longer anonymous to us.</p>

			<h3>How does Mixr Media use cookies?</h3>
			<p>Your Internet browser has a feature called cookies, which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit most of our sites, although active participation in certain areas of our sites may require cookies. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information, in which case we use the information to enhance your services in the ways described below. By adjusting your settings on your browser, you may elect not to allow cookies to be collected.</p>

			<p>We may also use technologies, including electronic images known as Web bugs—sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or beacons—that allow us to track general user-traffic patterns. We also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our site, and information about pages you visited. Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you.</p>

			<p>How does Mixr Media share the information?</p>

			<h4>Personally identifiable information</h4>
			<p>Information about our registered users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies or people only when: </p>

			<ul>
				<li>You have elected to allow us to share that information at the time that you registered with us or provided us the information, or through a subsequent affirmative election through our website.</li>
				<li>You volunteer information or create a public profile in the course of your participation in our community features such as forums, user opinions and reviews, chat rooms, photo sharing or other forms of public communication and interaction.</li>
				<li>We hire third-party vendors to provide specialized services such as customer support; email message deployment; suppression, merge and de-duplication services; data processing; and special products or services that you have requested. These companies are only allowed to use the information in order to help us fulfill our services to you. We do not provide your information to these companies for their own, permanent use.</li>
				<li>You are the winner of a contest or a sweepstakes that is co-sponsored with a third party and that third party needs your information in order to manage the prize fulfillment process.</li>
				<li>When required by law, such as when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process.</li>
				<li>We believe that your actions violate applicable laws, Mixr Media’s Terms of Use, or any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or threaten the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others.</li>
				<li>You consent to your personal information being shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information by opting out.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Aggregate information</h4>
			<p>We may from time to time aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.</p>

			<h4>Business transfers</h4>
			<p>We are always seeking to improve our network of Web sites and our business. In accomplishing these objectives, we may buy or sell a company, or one or more of the companies in our corporate family may merge with or be acquired by another company. If we sell a business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes.</p>

			<h3>What are my options?</h3>
			<p>Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to register with us. You can still view much of the content and use many of the services offered by our sites without registering.</p>


			<h3>How can I review and update my personally identifiable information?</h3>
			<p>You can review, correct, or change the information collected during registration for any of our sites. Users may change information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems with our services or who have questions about how our services work can contact us using e-mail addresses at the bottom of this page.</p>

			<h3>How will I know if the privacy policy is changed?</h3>
			<p>Any modifications to our privacy practices will be reflected first within this area of our network of Web sites. If there is a material change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our sites that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new privacy statement. If we are going to be using the information collected from users in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will send affected users written notice of the change by e-mail.</p>

			<h3>Privacy of children</h3>
			<p>None of the sites within our network is directed to children under the age of 13. We operate our network of sites in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and do not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age. </p>

			<h3>Questions, Comments, Contact</h3>
			<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the Mixr Media Privacy Policy or its implementation, you may contact us at this email address:</p>

			<p>support@mixrmedia.com</p>

			<p>We read every message submitted and try to reply promptly to every one. We may also file your comments to improve the site, or review and discard the information.</p>

			<p>Effective date: January 01, 2007</p>
