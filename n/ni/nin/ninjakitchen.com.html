                    Euro-Pro Operating LLC is committed to ensuring your privacy on the Internet by

                    adhering to high standards of fairness and integrity. We are committed to keeping

                        collect from me?</h4>

                    <br>

                    You do not have to provide personal information to gain access to or browse any

                    of our websites.

                    <br>

                    <br>

                    We require registering users of our website and owners registering their products

                    online to provide us with a name, telephone number, email address (if they have

                    one), postal address and zip code. We may also ask for additional information to

                    assist us with our development of new products.

                    <br>

                    <br>

                    If you purchase a product through any of our websites we will require you to provide

                    us with the above information plus your payment and delivery details.

                    <br>

                    <br>

                    If you send us email messages, you will automatically provide us with your electronic

                    in the text of your message.

                    <br>

                    We collect and store from all visitors to our websites, whether they actively provide

                    us with information or merely browse our website, the internet protocol (IP) address

                    of the computer they are using, the browser software they use and their operating

                    system, the date and time they access our website, the internet address of the website

                    from which they linked directly to our website, and other similar information. We

                    use this type of information to track website usage, to measure the number of visitors

                    to the different sections of our website and to help us make our website more useful.

                    Like most internet websites, we use “cookie” technology to obtain non-personal information

                    from online visitors.

                    <br>

                    <h4>

                        What are cookies and how does Euro-Pro Operating LLC use them?

                    </h4>

                    <br>

                    A "cookie" is a small text file that is sent to your web browser from a web server

                    and stored on your computer's hard drive. Sharkclean.com and Ninjakitchen.com use "cookies"

                    as a means of compiling information detailing the usage of our site. These findings

                    help us understand our customer's needs so that we may improve your browsing/shopping

                    experience at <a href="http://www.sharkclean.com">www.sharkclean.com</a> and <a href="http://www.ninjakitchen.com">

                        www.ninjakitchen.com</a>. Generally, we may use "cookies" to:

                    <br>

                    <br>

                    1. Estimate the number of users of our site.<br>

                    2. Quantify general usage of our site.<br>

                    3. Track aggregate traffic patterns.<br>

                    4. Assist in the personalization and general improvement of your experience at our websites.

                    <br>

                    <br>

                    Personal information cannot be extracted by simply placing a "cookie" on an individual's

                    computer. If you have submitted personal information to sharkclean.com or ninjakitchen.com,

                    then the aggregated data may be combined with some personal information for internal

                    marketing and reporting purposes.

                    <br>

                    <br>

                    Even though most Web browsers accept "cookies", most browsers also give you the

                    option to reject "cookies". Please note that if you set your browser to reject "cookies"

                    you will still be able to visit the sharkclean.com and ninjakitchen.com sites but

                    your shopping and browsing experience may be somewhat affected.<br>

                    <h4>

                        How does Euro-Pro Operating LLC use the collected information?</h4>

                    <br>

                    We use the personal information you provide for internal purposes, such as confirming

                    and tracking your order, subscription, or registration, analyzing trends and statistics,

                    informing you of our new products, services and offers, and providing you with information

                    from and about Euro-Pro and its sister companies.

                    <br>

                    From time to time, we make our mailing list (names and addresses only) and general

                    shopping activity available to carefully screened companies whose products we believe

                    will be of interest to you and whose privacy practices meet the Direct Marketing

                    Association's privacy standards. We will not share any personal financial information.

                    When you register with the site or access your account information, we offer the

                    use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information

                    is protected against both physical and electronically unauthorized access.<br>
