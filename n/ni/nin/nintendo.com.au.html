			<p><span class="gameindex-titles">Nintendo Australia Pty Ltd Web Site Privacy Policy</span><br>
			Nintendo Australia Pty Ltd (Nintendo) respects the privacy of online visitors and regards the security 
			of their personal information as being of the highest priority. </p>

			<p>Nintendo is not a party to an approved privacy code, but complies with the National Privacy Principles 
			(NPP’s) in the Privacy Act 1988 (Act) in relation to the collection, use, security of and access to 
			personal information.</p>
			
			<p>There are no exemptions under the Act which apply to collection of personal information on this web site. 
			Please read this policy carefully before you use this website or provide any personal information. This policy 
			complies with the Act. However, it does not necessarily comply with all of the requirements of the laws of other 
			countries. Accordingly, if you are a visitor from outside Australia it is recommended that you not provide 
			personal information to this site.</p>
				
			<p><span class="gameindex-titles">What information is collected?</span><br>
			When you register on this website you will be asked to provide personal information (as defined in the Act).</p>
				
			<p>Nintendo only collects personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis and only during 
			(1) contest registration; (2) newsletter registration; (3) surveys; (4) registration for games or special 
			game-specific promotion participation. Personal information collected may include your name, nickname, e-mail 
			address, mobile phone number, and birth date. We do not generally require this information to obtain access to 
			our site; however, there may be some areas of the site that you will not be able to access unless you register. 
			For example, "Members Only" areas will require you to register before you can access these areas.</p>
				
			<p>Nintendo also may collect demographic information from visitors, such as age, gender, geographic location, 
			game genre interests, what platforms you own and store you usually purchase from. This information helps us 
			improve our Online offerings and allows us to tailor information to your preferences.</p>

			<p><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" width="91" height="14" border="0" align="right"></a>
			Nintendo does not collect “sensitive information” (as defined in the Act).<a href="#top"></a></p>

			<p><span class="gameindex-titles">What happens to the information provided?</span><br>
				The information you provide will allow us to alert you to new products, 
				features and enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; 
				and contests and events of interest. Such announcements are delivered 
				via e-mail if you opt-in to this service. Nintendo does not sell 
				personal information that we collect. However, from time to time, 
				we are approached by companies and organizations that provide products 
				or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and we may 
				send out notices on behalf of these companies. We see this as a 
				value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. 
				We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers 
				that we think you would appreciate receiving. You may opt out if 
				you do not wish to receive such information.</p><p>

			</p><p>We may use your personal information for internal demographic 
                studies, so we can improve our web sites and products to better 
                meet our visitors' needs. In some cases, we may enhance and / 
                or merge your personal information with data collected from other 
                sources. In the event we enhance and/or merge your personal information 
                with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable 
                steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that personal information.Nintendo 
                occasionally uses outside agencies for market research, and may 
                provide these companies with your personal information. These 
                companies will be directed to follow Nintendo's privacy practices 
                in handling this information.</p>
				
			<p><span class="gameindex-titles">A special note about children 13 years old and under</span><br>
                Nintendo encourages parents and guardians to spend time online 
                with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children 
                to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, 
                without permission, when using the Internet. We recognise a special 
                obligation to protect personal information obtained from young 
                children. In order for children 13 years old and under to participate 
                in online activities that require registration, we require prior 
                permission from a parent or guardian (opt-in). If consent is not 
                received after 30 days (and a follow up e-mail after 20 days) 
                then information provided by the child be deleted and the child 
                will be advised accordingly.</p>
									
              <p><span class="gameindex-titles">What about cookies?</span><br>
                This web site may use cookies to keep track of your choices, or 
                to keep track of the fact that you have signed in so you don't 
                have to continually enter your username and password.<br>
                Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest 
                and for other purposes. (Cookies are small files downloaded to 
                your computer to track movements within web sites.) Most browsers 
                are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies 
                or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. 
                However some areas will not function properly if you do so. There 
                are many sources for additional information about Internet cookies, 
                and we encourage anyone concerned about the use of cookies to 
                do more research on the topic so you can make an informed decision 
                about accepting them from any site.</p>

				<span class="gameindex-titles">What about Web beacons?</span><br>
                In addition to cookies, Nintendo uses a common Internet technology 
                called "Web beacons" (a.k.a. "Web bugs," "action 
                tags," "pixel trackers," or "clear GIFs") 
                on some of its sites. Web beacons are small graphic images placed 
                on a Web page, Web-based document, or in an e-mail message that 
                are designed to allow us or a third party to collect certain information 
                and monitor user activity on our sites. Web beacons are invisible 
                to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 
                pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document 
                or e-mail message. We do not use Web beacons to collect or to 
                link to personal information. We may use Web beacons to collect 
                non-personal information such as the IP address of the computer 
                that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web user 
                comes from, and the time the Web beacon is activated (such as 
                when you view the Web page, advertisement, or e-mail that contains 
                the Web beacon). We may also use Web beacons to display e-mails 
                in the appropriate HTML or text format. From time to time, we 
                may permit third parties to place Web beacons on our sites or 
                in e-mails sent on our behalf for purposes of collecting the same 
                types of information specified above, but these Web beacons do 
                not collect and are not linked to personal information either.</p>

			<p><span class="gameindex-titles">E-mail correspondence to Nintendo</span><br>
                Nintendo will respond to e-mail correspondence if such correspondence 
                includes a return e-mail address. Because an e-mail address is 
                personal identifying information, Nintendo protects the privacy 
                of the sender by limiting access to these e-mail messages and 
                keeping them in a secure e-mail system. Most e-mail messages are 
                deleted after they are responded to, however in certain cases 
                hard copies or data from certain e-mail correspondence may be 
                kept on file. Any such copies will also be stored in a secure 
                location, and information from these messages will not be used 
                for marketing purposes. In the event that Nintendo becomes legally 
                obligated to disclose information obtained from consumers on its 
                web site to another pursuant to legal or administrative process, 
                Nintendo will take all reasonable steps to redact personal information 
                from the data where possible.</p>
			
			<p><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" width="91" height="14" border="0" align="right"></a>
			<span class="gameindex-titles">Removal from Nintendo's e-mail list</span><br>
              If you do not want Nintendo to send you e-mail you can unsubscribe 
              via selecting the unsubscribe option when you receive an email from 
              Nintendo or by unsubscribing via the unsubscribe option in the registration 
              section. If you have opted-in and at a later date you choose to 
              have your name removed from our e-mail database, you can do so from the 
<a href="../../nintendo/connect/index.php">Members section</a>.</p>

			<p>Nintendo reserves the right to unsubscribe details when an email address supplied is invalid.</p>

			<p><span class="gameindex-titles">Safeguarding your personally identifiable information</span><br>
                We will only collect personally identifiable information to the 
                extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business 
                purposes, and we will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure 
                the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have 
                provided. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure 
                that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient 
                protection of that personal information.</p>
				
              <p><span class="gameindex-titles">Review and correction of information</span><br>
