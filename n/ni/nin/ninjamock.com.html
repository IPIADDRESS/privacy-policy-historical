                                        <p>We may ask you for certain information, referred to as "personal information", which includes information that pertains to your identity. Such information may include, but is not limited to, information such as your name, email address, and credit card information.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>You may be required to provide personal information to access or use certain parts or features of the NinjaMock Service. For example, you will be asked to provide your name and a valid email address to establish an account at http://ninjamock.com. If you wish to establish a paid NinjaMock account, you will also be asked to provide credit card account and billing information. If you do not provide the requested personal information, you may not be able to access or use the particular component of the Service where such information is required.</p>

                                        <h3>Survey Information</h3>
                                        <p>From time to time, NinjaMock may ask its registered users to participate in surveys. These surveys are purely optional and help us improve the NinjaMock Service and provide aggregate information which we think may interest our registered users and visitors. We may use the information that you voluntarily provide as part of your survey response in the manner outlined in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if you choose to participate in a NinjaMock survey, any information you provide to us, including personal information, will be linked with your account in our system and to any personal information contained therein. We may also use the information you provide in the aggregate to help us generate statistics regarding use of the NinjaMock Service. For example, if you reveal in a survey response that you are a professor, NinjaMock will know that you are a professor, will retain that information in association with your registered user account, and may publish aggregate statistics based thereon (for example, statistics regarding what portion of our educational users are professors versus what portion of our educational users are students). If you would not like your information to be used in this way, please do not participate in NinjaMock surveys or, if participating, please provide us only with information you consent to our use of in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                                <p>Some components of the NinjaMock Service allow you to share content and personal messages you upload with others by generating messages directly to those other individuals. To use this feature, we require you provide us with a valid email address for each recipient. NinjaMock uses these email addresses only to share your content and personal messages (at your direction). We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and do not store it after this one-time email is sent. This one-time email may also contain a short description and explanation of the NinjaMock Service.</p>

                                        <p>There may be other instances in which we collect information from you that is more general in nature ("general information"). Such information may include information recorded by our server logs from your browser such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address (which enables us to identify your computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network like the internet), and the specific web page you requested. Such general information, including the clickstream data and cookies, as mentioned below, may be collected from you whenever you access or use the NinjaMock Service, whether or not you provide us with any other personal information.</p>

This information can be combined with information you have provided to us, which will enable us to analyze and better customize your visits. We may use clickstream data for traffic analysis or e-commerce analysis of our services, to determine which features within the NinjaMock Service are most or least effective or useful to you.</p>

These parties will only use your data for the purpose of carrying out the work as agreed with us and will be required to keep the information confidential.</li>
                                            <li>To send you information or materials via email about products, offers, and news we think might interest you.

                                            <li>To share your Public User Content with other NinjaMock users who we think might be interested, including with other users from your organization. In addition to your Public User Content we may also share the username associated with your public, paid or educational account with other users registered with an e-mail address using the domain of the same organization as your e-mail address. If you are not a habitual resident of a Member State of the European Economic Area, we may also share your name and your email address with the organization having the same domain as your email address.</li>
                                            <li>To facilitate collaboration between users as set out in point 6.1 of our Terms of Use.</li>

                                            <li>To publish aggregate statistics regarding our user base. For example, we may choose to publish statistics regarding how many registered NinjaMock users live in the U.S. versus how many live in Europe.

In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of NinjaMock may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

We may disclose personal or general information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, which may include responding to requests and court orders from jurisdictions outside the State of Denmark.

Personal registration information submitted by a minor violates the website terms of use and will not be accepted. Any general information provided by minor and gathered (for example, through the use of cookies) during his or her visit may be used as indicated in this privacy policy.

Your visits and access to such websites is at your own risk. Please note that those other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.</p>
