                                      <p>We are serious about protecting the privacy of our users, which comprise consumers and posters. We use information collected about you  only as permitted in this Privacy Policy. This is our privacy policy,  but please be aware that should you follow a link to another Web site,  you are no longer covered by this policy. It’s a good idea to understand  the privacy policy of any Web site before sharing personal information  with it. Words and phrases used in this policy have the same meaning as  in the <a title="Terms of Service" href="http://www.niagararents.ca/terms-of-service/" target="_self">Terms of Service</a> (the “Terms of Service”).</p>
<p><em>Who processes your personal data?:</em><br>
Your personal data (also referred to as personal information) – that is,  data that identifies you, or from which you are identifiable – will be  collected, processed, stored and used by us, and passed to and processed  by our subsidiary and/or affiliated companies and other data processors  acting under contract with us. Personal data contributed by or  collected from users may be stored and processed in Canada or any other  country in which we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain  facilities, and by using our site, you acknowledge and agree that you  may be transferring your personal data outside of the country in which  you have contributed it, and that you consent to any such transfer of  information outside of your country. These countries may not have  similar data protection laws to those that apply in your country.  However, if we transfer your personal data outside of your country in  this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue  to be protected in compliance with applicable data protection law and  this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><em>The information we gather:</em><br>
At various times you may contribute your personal data to us. For  example, in order to process a request or inquiry you may make  concerning a property or transaction, we need to know all or some of the  following: your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address,  and, in the case of a poster placing an ad, a method of  payment. You may also contribute personal data to us at other times,  such as when registering on the site.</p>
<p><em>How we use your personal data:</em><br>
Your personal data will be used to provide and promote our site, to  provide user support, and for any other purposes referred to in this  Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>We will also use the personal data users provide to us to contact the  user from time to time with critical user or service updates, and to  send other messages that are integral to the service we provide on the site. If you have an account on the site, we must always be able to  e-mail operational information about your account and your use of  our services to you.</p>
<p>Your personal information is not shared with third parties, except: 1)  in the case of special promotions by us, or one of our partners, about  which you’ve requested to be notified; 2) where a third party performs  services on our behalf and has agreed to keep such information  confidential (such as the processing of your credit card payment); and  3) our Affiliates, but only for the purpose of performing this  Agreement.</p>
<p>In the event that we or the site are acquired by a third party, your  personal information may be transferred to any such acquiror.</p>
<p><em>Newsletters:</em><br>
As a member of the site, you will receive our notices from time to time,  which is an integral part of the service we provide.</p>
<p><em>Surveys:</em><br>
Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our  users. From time to time, we request users’ input in order to evaluate  potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is  completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve  our services.</p>
<p><em>Inquiries:</em><br>
Site users may send inquiries to posters via clickable links on site ads. If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your  personal information, including your e-mail address and any other  information you supply, will be visible to the poster in question so  that they might reply directly to you. If you call the poster, you may  be asked to leave a return telephone number. Do not share information  in the email or phone call that you are not prepared to allow them to  have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank account  information. These inquiries are both sent to the individual poster  you selected and temporarily retained by us. The resulting inquiry is  available for review only by the poster to whom they were initially  addressed and to our customer service employees, who may be asked by posters&nbsp; for their past inquiry information. While the content of these  inquiries are not shared with any other party, the site may, from time  to time, use third party email servers to send and track receipt of the  inquiry emails, and analyze the pattern of inquiry usage reported by  these third party tracking systems; the resulting information is used  and stored.</p>
<p><em>How Do We Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?:</em><br>
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to guard  against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your personal data and  against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal  data. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the  measures implemented by our site reduce the likelihood of security  problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have  security measures in place to protect our user database and access to  this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each user’s  responsibility:</p>
<p>1. to protect against unauthorized access to your use of the site;<br>
2. to ensure no-one else uses the site while the user’s machine is  “logged on” to the site service;<br>
3. to log off or exit from site when not using it; and<br>
4. where relevant, to keep his/her password or other access information  secret.</p>
<p>All personal information is stored on a secure server. We do not store  credit card numbers or related identifying information on any site  server. All such information is stored by our credit card processing  partner, on their secured servers, and is protected via its proprietary  methods. Please remember that many services and transactions are  performed by our business partners. Our privacy policy and our security  or common practices do not apply to third-party companies.</p>
<p><em>What is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?:</em><br>
A “cookie” is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store  in a Web browser so that it can later be read back from that browser.  We may use cookies to store some personal preferences for your future  visits. Cookies allow us to recognize you more quickly; therefore, your  time spent on our site can be more personalized and productive. You’ll  find that cookies are an industry standard and are used at most major  Web sites in much the same way we use them here at our site.</p>
<p>We use third-party site usage tracking companies to analyze your site  visit or to conduct surveys. In the course of serving our pages, these  third parties may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.  These companies may use information about your visits to the site and  other Web sites in order to help us understand how to serve you better.</p>
<p>We also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you  visit our site. These companies may use information about your visits to  this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods  and services of interest to you. When you view a web page on our site  that contains advertising provided by one of these third parties, the  service provider may place a cookie on or retrieve a cookie from your  computer if you have not disabled your browser from receiving cookies.</p>
<p>If you wish, you can prevent cookie files from using (non-personal)  information about you by either deleting the cookie folder in your  browser or by putting your browser’s Privacy setting higher, but doing  so will mean that (a) your use of the site will be adversely affected  (and quite possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and  other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalize your experience  will be adversely affected, and (c) you will not be presented with  advertising that reflects the way that you use our, and other, sites.</p>
<p><em>Web Beacons and Clear GIFs:</em><br>
We gather and share anonymised information concerning the usage of the site by users with one or more third-party tracking  companies for the purpose of reporting statistics. In this connection,  some of the pages you visit on our Site use electronic images placed in  the web page code, called pixel tags (also called “clear GIFs” or “Web  Beacons”) that can serve many of the same purposes as cookies.</p>
<p>Web beacons may be used to track the traffic patterns of users from one  page to another in order to maximize web traffic flow.</p>
<p>The site’s third-party advertising service providers may also use Web  Beacons to recognize you when you visit the site and to help determine  how you found the site.</p>
<p><em>How we protect your privacy with third parties:</em><br>
* As indicated above, we may work with other companies who place cookies  or web beacons on our site. These companies help operate our site and  provide you with additional products and services. They are subject to  confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions. We do  not permit any of these companies to collect personal information using  cookies or web beacons on our site.<br>
* Some of these companies are our service providers who place cookies  that help us serve our own content and compile anonymous site metrics  and analytics. We require these companies to use the information they  collect only to provide us with these services under contract.<br>
* We participate in cookie-based ad networks. This means that these  companies may use some anonymous information about you (based on a  cookie on your computer) to display ads. We do not permit these  companies to collect any personal information about you.</p>
<p><em>How do I correct or update my information?:</em><br>
We allow our users the option to change or modify information previously  provided. This may be done by logging in and making the appropriate  changes.</p>
<p><em>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</em><br>
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time,  and post the new version on the site. When we do so, we will notify you  of the fact on the main screen of the site and the new version of this  Privacy Policy will take effect, and will govern all site services and  your relationship with us:</p>
<p>1. commencing one month after the date of posting;<br>
