                    In order to use parts of this Web site, a user must first
                    complete the registration form. During registration, a user
                    is required to give his/her contact information (such as
                    name and e-mail address). This information is used to inform
                    the user about the services he/she is interested in. It is
                    optional for the user to provide demographic information
                    (such as ethnicity and gender), and unique identifiers (such
                    as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide
                    a more personalized experience on our site.</p>

                    Order</b><br>
                    We request information from the user on our order form. Here
                    a user must provide contact information (like name and
                    shipping address) and financial information (like credit
                    card number, expiration date). This information is used for
                    billing purposes and to fill customers’ orders. If we have
                    trouble processing an order, this contact information is
                    used to get in touch with the user.</p>
                    <p><br>
                    <b>Cookies</b><br>
                    A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard
                    drive containing information about him/her. Usage of a
                    cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable
                    information while on our site. Once the user closes his/her
                    browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by
                    setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log
                    in a password more than once, which saves time while on our
                    site. If a user rejects the cookie, he/she may still use our
                    site, but will have limited usage of our site. Cookies can
                    also enable us to track and target the interests of our
                    users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>

                    <b>Log Files</b><br>
                    We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site,
                    track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic
                    information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked
                    to personally identifiable information.</p>

                    <b>Surveys &amp; Contests<br>
                    </b>From time to time, our site requests information from
                    users via surveys or contests. Participation in these
                    surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Information
                    requested may include contact information (such as name and
                    shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip
                    code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify
                    the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be
                    used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and

                    </b>If a user elects to use our referral service for
                    informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the

                    automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting
                    them to visit the site. NIAGARA UNIVERSITY stores this
                    information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time
                    e-mail. The friend may contact NIAGARA UNIVERSITY at

                    information from the university’s database.</p>

                    <b>Security<br>
                    </b>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our
                    users’ information. When users submit sensitive
                    information via the Web site, your information is protected
                    both online and off-line. When our registration/order form
                    asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit
                    card number and/or social security number), that information
                    is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption
                    software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such
                    as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web
                    browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet
                    Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open,
                    when you are just “surfing”.</p>
                    <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive
                    information online, we also take precautions to protect
                    user-information off-line. All of our users’ information,
                    including the sensitive information mentioned above, is
                    restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the
                    information to perform a specific job (for example, our
                    billing clerk or a customer service representative) are
                    granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL
                    employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy
                    practices. Every quarter, and any time new policies are
                    added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the
                    importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to
                    ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally,
                    the servers that we store personally identifiable
                    information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a
                    locked cage. If you have any questions about the security at
                    our Web site, you can send an email to webmaster@niagara.edu.</p>

                    Site and Service Updates<br>
                    </b>We also send the user site and service announcement
                    updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service
                    announcements, which contain important information about the
                    service. We communicate with the user to provide requested

                    via e-mail or phone.</p>

                    <b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:<br>
                    </b>If a user’s personally identifiable information
                    changes (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires
                    our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct,
                    update or remove that user’s personal data. This can
                    usually be done at the member information page<b> </b>or by
                    e-mailing our customer support<b>.</b> [Some sites may also

                    having their information used for purposes not directly
                    related to our site when we ask for the information. For
                    example, our order form has an “opt-out” mechanism so
                    users who buy a product from us, but don’t want any
                    marketing material, can keep their e-mail address off of our
                    lists.</p>
                    <p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or
                    promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of
                    receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in
                    the subject line in the e-mail or e-mail us at webmaster@niagara.edu
                    [Some sites are able to offer opt-out mechanisms on member
                    information pages and also supply a telephone or postal
                    option as a way to opt-out.]</p>
                    <p>Users of our site are always notified when their
                    information is being collected by any outside parties. We do
                    this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether
                    or not they should proceed with services that require an
                    outside party.</p>

                    those changes on our home page so our users are always aware
