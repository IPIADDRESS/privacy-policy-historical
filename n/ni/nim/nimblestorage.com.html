                    <br>
                  We are committed to protecting your personal information and respecting your  privacy. We will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to any  third parties. We will not use or disclose your information for purposes other  than those set forth in this Privacy Policy, unless you give us your permission  or we are legally compelled to do so, such as by law, subpoena, or court order,  or unless such disclosure or use becomes necessary for the protection of our  legal interests.<br>
                  <br>
                  1. INFORMATION COLLECTION<br>
                  The kind of information we collect from you online depends on how you decide to  use our website or services. If you choose simply to browse our site, you will  not need to submit any personal information at all. However, you might choose  to provide us with your personally identifiable information by such means as  e-mailing us, sending us your resume, or filling out certain forms on our  website.<br>
                  <br>
                  Our system may also gather certain technical data about your visit, which helps  us understand better how our site is being used and how we can improve it. This  automatically gathered information does not identify you personally; it may  include your computer's IP or "Internet Protocol" address, as well as  statistics about how visitors navigate through our site.<br>
                  <br>
                  2. INFORMATION USE <br>
                  (a) E-mail Contact: <a href="mailto:info@nimblestorage.com">info@nimblestorage.com</a>. If you choose to contact us by  e-mail, we will keep your contact information private although we may use it to  respond to your message. No confidentiality will apply to the subject matter of  your message, however, so we recommend that you do not send us any ideas or  suggestions that you consider proprietary or confidential. All e-mail content  (except your contact information) will be treated as volunteered to Nimble  Storage for our use in any manner.<br>
                  <br>
                  (b) Solicited Information: We may ask our visitors for personal information  through forms on our website for registering for events, joining our mailing  list, becoming a business partner, or inquiring about product sales. The  personal information you choose to provide on these forms, which would  typically include your name, company name, and contact information, may be used  by Nimble Storage in a manner consistent with the stated purpose of the given  form. In addition, we may use visitor responses for non-personal assessment of  their preferences so we can tailor our site's contents to better suit the tastes  and needs of our audience. If we intend to use or share your personal  information for any other purposes, we will notify you of that purpose and give  you a chance to opt out before you submit your information. For example, if you  are asked for your e-mail address, we will not add it to any automatic mailing  lists unless we've asked for permission to do so.<br>
                  <br>
                  (c) Employment Opportunities: Our site may provide you with a means for  submitting your resume or other personal information for consideration for  employment opportunities at Nimble Storage. Personal information received  through resume submissions will be kept confidential. We may contact you for  additional information to supplement your resume, and we may use your  information within Nimble Storage, or keep it on file for future use, as we  make our hiring decisions.<br>
                  <br>
                  (d) Automatically Gathered Data: We may use the non-personal information  gathered automatically by our system--such as computer IP addresses, the kind  of browsers our viewers are using, and a record of the pages viewed on our  site--so we can understand how to make our site more convenient and useful to  our audience. We may also share this information, in aggregate form, with  parties we hire to help us perform our business.<br>
                  <br>
                  (e) Transfer of Data: In order to promote continuity of services and support,  if Nimble Storage’s business is acquired or merges with another company, we may  transfer the information you've shared with us to the successor company. In the  unlikely event that we cease business operations, we may similarly transfer  this data to another company that offers comparable products or services. The  use and disclosure of transferred data may be governed by the privacy practices  of the successor company.<br>
                  <br>
                  3. MANAGING YOUR PRIVACY<br>
                  As stated above, we will not collect personally identifying information about  you without your knowledge, so the decision whether or not to share this  information is completely up to you. You may request deletion or modification  of your other personal information by contacting us at <a href="mailtoinfo@nimblestorage.com">info@nimblestorage.com</a>.  Note that any deleted information may remain in our data store as a result of  routine system back-ups, but we will no longer use that information.<br>
                  <br>
                  4. INFORMATION SECURITY<br>
                  In order to maintain the integrity and security of your personal information,  we store this information on non-public computer systems with firewall and  password protection to prevent access by anyone other than authorized Nimble  Storage employees. Of course, we appreciate your help in safeguarding the  integrity of your own privacy. We encourage you to let us know immediately if  you suspect that the information you share with us is being used in any way  contrary to this Privacy Policy, and we will investigate your inquiry as  promptly as possible. To contact us, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@nimblestorage.com.">info@nimblestorage.com.<br>
                  </a><br>
                  5. OUTSIDE LINKS<br>
                  Our website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that these  third-party sites may collect information about you, and that they operate  according to their own privacy practices. If you have any questions about  linking to our site, contact <a href="mailto:info@nimblestorage.com">info@nimblestorage.com</a>.<br>
                  <br>
                  6. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY PROTECTION<br>
                  Nimble Storage, its website, and its products are not directed to children. We  will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone  under 13.<br>
                  <br>
