                    <p>We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies

                    <h4>WHAT KIND OF COOKIES DO WE USE?</h4>

                    <p>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is
                        sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser on your mobile device or computer
                        to identify you (usually based on an anonymous identifier). The identifier is then sent back to the
                        server each time the browser requests a page from the server in order to identify your visit to a
                        particular page, the list of ads you have responded to, the type of browser you are using, and also
                        to remember information you have filled it on our website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We use cookies to personalise content and ads to provide social media features and to
                        analyse our traffic. We also share information about use of our Site with our social media,
                        advertising and analytics partners who may combine it with other information that you’ve provided to
                        them or that they’ve collected from your use of their services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of using Cookies is to be able to adapt to your needs, to distinguish
                        you from other users, to prevent the display of irrelevant ads in your web browser and to prevent
                        the need for your repeated login to our Interface.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie
                        will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by
                        the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the
                        user session, when the web browser is closed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also
                        third-party
                        Cookies: ​Third-party
                        cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than our Site. For example, a website might have
                        a social media like button on their site. That like button will set a cookie that can be read by
                        social media provider. The aim of
                        third-party
                        cookies is often to collect certain information to carry out various research into behaviour,
                        demographics and not least for targeted marketing etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user,
                        but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and
                        obtained from cookies.</p>
                    <p>
                        We use both session, persistent and
