            strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet 
            technology and to provide an interactive and personalized 
            experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your 
            name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to 
            the terms of this privacy policy.&nbsp; "We will never sell, barter,

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">How we gather information from 
            users</font></p></b>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">How we collect and store information 
            depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you 
            elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may 
            be asked to provide information when you register for access to 
            certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as 
            newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information 
            when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and 
            chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. NicheBuddy Web sites also collect information 
            automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be 
            transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of 
            your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize 
            you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the 
            cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from 
            having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may 
            control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement 
            while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may 
            also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you 
            can choose not to provide us with information, for example by 
            setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you 
            may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked 
            to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to 
            customize the site?s features according to your 
            preferences.</font></p><b>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What we do with the information we 
            collect</font></p></b>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like other Web publishers, we collect 
            information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized 
            content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share 
            your information with anyone.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aggregated Information (information 
            that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For 
            example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with 
            similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our 
            site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or 
            what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may 
            occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. 
            Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable 
            Information about you or allow anyone to identify you 
            individually.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We may use Personally Identifiable

            transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
            communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical 
            support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for 
            example) may access such information. We will use your information 
            only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we 
            continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner 
            with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user 
            information may be among the transferred assets. We may also 
            disclose your information in response to a court order, at other 
            times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in 
            connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or 
            to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or 
            necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to 
            disclosure in such cases.</font></p><b>

            is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the 
            advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular 
            advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer
