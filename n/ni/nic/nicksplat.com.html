<h2>LAST UPDATED: 6/21/2017</h2>
<p>(See <a href="http://legal.viacom.com/Changes/K+F" target="_blank">Summary of Most Significant Changes</a> to learn more.)</p>
<p class="legal-page-paragraph">Welcome! This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") describes our privacy practices for the "Nickelodeon Sites" of the "Nickelodeon Group." The Nickelodeon Group is a business unit of Viacom Media Networks, a division of Viacom International, Inc. The Nickelodeon Sites (or, individually, "Site") are the Internet websites, applications and other interactive services that are offered by the Nickelodeon Group for use on mobile devices, tablets, personal computers and any other devices that connect to the Internet. Some of the Nickelodeon Sites are intended for children and some are intended for older audiences. By accessing any of the Nickelodeon Sites, you are consenting to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy describes what information the Nickelodeon Sites collect from users, including children, when they visit the Nickelodeon Sites; how such information is used and stored; when such information may be disclosed to third parties; how users, parents, and guardians can control the use and disclosure of collected information; and how information is protected.</p>
<p class="legal-page-paragraph">Our visitors' privacy is important to us, and we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protection for children on the Nickelodeon Sites permitting such visitors. Our privacy practices are guided by the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as well as data privacy laws in the United States and other applicable countries. Younger visitors should always check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website or mobile application and we encourage families to discuss their household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal information. For a list of websites to which this Privacy Policy applies that are directed to children under 13 years of age, please click <a href="http://www.nick.com/nick-assets/copy/nickelodeon-sites.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="legal-section-anchor" id="I">I.INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE.</a></h3>
<p class="legal-page-paragraph">We may request or collect certain information when you visit the Nickelodeon Sites. However, visitors are
required to share only the information that is reasonably necessary to participate in
the particular activity.</p>
<p class="legal-page-paragraph"><a class="legal-section-anchor" id="I_A"> A. Registration Information</a>: The information required to register varies by
Site, but may include: (a) birth date; (b) gender; (c) country; (d) state; (e) zip
code; (f) user name and password; (g) wireless telephone number; (h) email address; and
(i) other profile information such as avatar preferences, communications preferences,
and interests. If the Site either is directed to children under 13 or has actual
knowledge that a user is under 13 years old, the child may be asked to provide his or her
parent's or guardian's email address. For certain countries, child visitors or their parents/guardians
will receive an activation email and must follow the procedures or otherwise agree to
the terms within the activation email within a certain time period to activate the
account; accounts not activated within that time period will be deleted.</p>
<p class="legal-page-paragraph">Registration information is used to enable visitors to log into their accounts across different devices and platforms; take advantage of site offerings; respond to
visitor's requests for products, services, and information; send communications to users in connection with their account; manage games; serve
appropriate material; customize the content you see when you visit the Nickelodeon
Sites; and offer visitors special offers and promotions from Nickelodeon Sites and the
"Viacom family of companies" (which comprises Viacom International Inc. and
its subsidiaries and affiliates), as well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services, that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p class="legal-page-paragraph">Certain non-child-directed Sites may offer visitors opportunities to apply for certain programs or other employment, training or internship opportunities. In order to submit an application for any one of these opportunities, the applicant may be required to supply other pertinent personal information including, without limitation, full name, postal address, telephone number(s) and email address. Additional personal information and other information may be requested during the application process (but may not be required). Such submissions are also subject to the policies regarding such respective programs.
</p>

<p class="legal-page-paragraph"><a class="legal-section-anchor" id="I_B">B. Social Platform
Registrations and Social Media Plugins</a>: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites permit or
require users who are at least 13 years old to register or log into their account via a social networking platform such
as Login with Facebook or Flux, or permit you to use social media plugins such as the
Facebook "Like" or Google "+1" buttons. When you use these
social networking platforms and plugins, your username and password for the services
and other information available about you or collected from you on these services may
be shared with us.</p>
<p class="legal-page-paragraph">When you use social
networking platforms and plugins, you share your information with them and their
privacy policy applies to their collection, use, and disclosure of such information. In
addition, they may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on
the Nickelodeon Sites, and they may notify your connections on the social networking
platform about your use of the Nickelodeon Sites. Such services may also employ unique
identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for
purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you. For more information about logging into Facebook, please go <a class="legal-external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/292105707596942/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note that
their privacy policies may be different from our own and we encourage you to read them.
</p>

<p class="legal-page-paragraph"><a class="legal-section-anchor" id="I_C">C. Computer Information Collected by Us</a>: When visitors come to a Site, we may automatically
collect certain information from their computers or mobile devices, such as the type of
computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the visitor's IP address, the
web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox), UDID (for certain mobile
devices), information about the websites visited before and after visiting the Site,
the web pages and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within the Nickelodeon
Sites, interactions with e-mail messages sent by a Site or the Viacom family of
companies (<em>e.g.</em>, links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or
forwarded), information collected through the use of unique identifiers such as cookies
(see below), information regarding the Internet service provider, and other standard
server log information ("Computer Information").</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not, unless specifically stated, apply to any personal information or other information collected by any other company or collected in any other manner or by any other website, application or other interactive service offered by the Viacom family of companies.&nbsp; Such information collection may be governed by separate privacy policies or notices.&nbsp; In particular, <a href="http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/Privacy_Shield_Privacy_Policy_Viacom.pdf" target="_blank">please see our Privacy Shield Privacy Policy for</a> information on our privacy policy and practices with respect to personal information transferred to the U.S.</p>
<p class="legal-page-paragraph">We may use cookies, web
 beacons, tokens or similar technologies (collectively referred to as "Tracking
 Technologies") on the Nickelodeon Sites. "Cookies" (which may be html files,
 Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and
 activity. "Web beacons" (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs)
 are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views,
 promotion views or advertising responses. "Tokens" are unique
 persistent identifiers that are generated and sent from a server, such as Adobe's Pass
 service, to a user's device to identify an interaction session, such as the authentication
 for a user's cable provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie.
 The Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies to collect Computer
Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.</p>

<p class="legal-page-paragraph">We may use Tracking
Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between certain
Nickelodeon Sites without logging into each Site, enable the internal functioning of
the Nickelodeon Sites, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the
content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on the
Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand
your interactions with email messages originating from the Nickelodeon Sites or the
Viacom family of companies (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were
opened or forwarded), save your password, save your online game or video player
settings, enable you to use shopping carts, help us offer you products, programs or
services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and
administer the Nickelodeon Sites. These Tracking Technologies collect
"click stream" data and additional other information regarding your visits
to the Nickelodeon Sites (such as your visits to specific webpages, use of features,
purchasing history or preferences), may collect such other information across multiple
sessions on the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites offered by the Viacom family of

To the extent that third parties collect any personal information for any other purposes about users of the Nickelodeon Sites that are directed to children under 13 years of age, or where Nickelodeon has actual knowledge that a user is under 13 years of age, we will notify parents or guardians, including by listing those third parties here [<a class="legal-external-link" href="http://www.nick.com/nick-assets/copy/third-parties.html" target="_blank">http://www.nick.com/nick-assets/copy/third-parties.html</a>], and will request parental consent for the collection of that data.</p>

<p class="legal-page-paragraph">Among the service providers we engage, Nickelodeon Sites use a variety of third-party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, "Third Party Advertising Service Providers") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Nickelodeon Sites, help prevent you from seeing repeated advertisements, and measure and analyze traffic on the Nickelodeon Sites. On websites directed to older audiences, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may also be used to facilitate targeting of advertisements and measure and analyze advertising effectiveness ("Targeting Services"). These Targeting Services enable us, for older audiences, to display advertisements based on your visits to the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites you have visited and may include delivering advertisements or other content for products and services that may interest you. Targeting Services also enable us to research the usefulness of certain advertisements.

<p class="legal-page-paragraph">Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</p>

<p class="legal-page-paragraph">We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as set forth above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described above in Section I(C).</p>

<p class="legal-page-paragraph"><a class="legal-section-anchor" id="I_E">E. Contests,
Sweepstakes and Promotions:</a> The Nickelodeon Sites may offer online contests, sweepstakes and promotions.
To enter these contests, sweepstakes and promotions, you may be required to provide your first name
and email address and/or additional information required for the management of the
contest, sweepstakes or promotion. On sites that either are directed to children under 13 or
where we have actual knowledge that a user is a child under 13, we may collect the
child's e-mail address to enter the child in the contest, sweepstakes or promotion, store
such child's email address for the duration of the contest, sweepstakes or promotion, and use it for
notification if he or she is the winner. For certain contests, sweepstakes or promotions on such
sites, we may ask for the email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the
parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent or guardian the
option to have the child's entry deleted.</p>

<p class="legal-page-orange-indent"><a class="legal-section-anchor" id="I_F">F.
Electronic Postcards and Messages</a>: Some Nickelodeon Sites provide visitors the
opportunity to send electronic postcards and "wish lists" of items they
want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the visitor's behalf,
email messages to family and/or friends. To do so, visitors must provide the email
address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. Visitors must only provide email addresses of people who they know would be happy to receive such electronic postcards or email messages. Email
addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the requested
postcard or email message and are deleted from our system once the postcard or message
is sent. In some cases, we may offer visitors an incentive (<em>e.g.</em>, points
to be used in an online game) for referring information about products to the visitor's
family or friends. In such cases, we will comply with all applicable legal
requirements. Please note that this feature may not be available to visitors in certain
regions or countries.</p>

<a class="legal-section-anchor" id="I_G">G. Electronic Newsletters</a>: Visitors can provide their email addresses to

of companies, and our business partners. Visitors may change their preferences
regarding emails at any time through the unsubscribe link in the newsletters or, for
certain Nickelodeon Sites, by logging into and changing the preferences for their
account.</p>

<p class="legal-page-paragraph">When visitors to
Nickelodeon Sites that are directed to children under 13 ask to receive our email
newsletter(s), they will be asked to provide their first name, email address and
the email address of their parent/guardian. We will send the child's parent/guardian a
notification email informing them of the child's request to receive by email the
newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent/guardian the option to have his or
her child's information removed from our newsletter database. The link to remove the
child's information will expire approximately 48 hours from the time it is sent,
but at any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent/guardian
may request that we stop sending the child the newsletter(s) by following the
"unsubscribe" instructions found at the end of any of the newsletter emails.
Parents/guardians may at any time review any personally identifiable information
collected online about their child. See section V(B) below. When a child provides a
parent's/guardian's email address when signing up for newsletter(s), that email address
is used to send the notification email message and is subsequently deleted from our system.
</p>

<p class="legal-page-orange-indent"><a class="legal-section-anchor" id="I_H">H. Interactive
Features and Services</a>: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites offer interactive features and
services, such as message boards and comment boxes. For certain countries, on Nickelodeon
Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or when we have actual knowledge that a
user is a child under 13 years old, we either will obtain the consent of the
child's parent/guardian before allowing the child to use these interactive features and
services or use reasonable technical measures to delete all or virtually all
personal information from a child's postings before they are made public and delete such information from our records. We use the information collected through
interactive features and services to enable you to participate in such features and services.

<p class="legal-page-paragraph">When you register for Text Services, you acknowledge, understand and agree that you may be charged by your wireless carrier for the ability to send or receive all such messages.

incurred by such visitor or by a person that has access to a visitor's wireless device,

If you change or deactivate your wireless telephone number, you agree to notify us when your wireless telephone number is no longer associated with you and identify such wireless phone number to ensure that future messages directed to you are not sent to the person to whom your old number has been or will be assigned.
We may share your personal information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering Text Services and similar services to you, with the Viacom family of companies and as otherwise provided in <a class="legal-external-link" href="#II">"Disclosure to Third Parties"</a> below.</p>

Geolocation Information</a>: We may collect and store information about your
geographic location, but we will only collect precise geolocation information sufficient
to identify street name and name of a city or town on Nickelodeon Sites that either are
directed to users over 13 or when we have actual knowledge that a user is over 13 years old and
only if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location
information. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device
to prevent it from providing us with such information. We use this information, for

messaging services or customized video content. These partners operate websites and services that are separate and
independent from the Nickelodeon Sites and, accordingly, may have their own privacy
policies. If you consent or register with one of our partners, that means you
grant the Nickelodeon Sites permission to give your registration and other information,

<p class="legal-page-paragraph">Some Nickelodeon Sites
offer co-branded services and features, such as events and promotions that we put
together with another company ("Co-Branded Partner"). Such services may be hosted on a
Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner's website. We may share your information with our
Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service
or feature means that you opt-in and affirmatively consent to both the Nickelodeon
Sites and our Co-Branded Partner collecting and using the information you provided
during registration and/or in connection with the specific co-branded feature for
fulfillment, marketing or administrative purposes. If you wish to opt-out of a
Co-Branded Partner's future use of your information for marketing purposes, you will
need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly. The Co-Branded Partner will be
identified on the co-branded feature or service.</p>

<p class="legal-page-orange-indent"><a class="legal-section-anchor" id="II_E"> E. Viacom and Other Affiliated Businesses</a></p>

<p class="legal-page-paragraph">The Nickelodeon Sites

sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, information collected at the Nickelodeon
Sites may be transferred to the acquiring company.</p>

conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions. We limit access to
visitor's information to employees and contractors who are authorized for the
proper handling of such information, and any employee found violating our standards of
security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We also
take reasonable steps to help make sure our third-party agents protect the security of
your personal information. However, as with most Internet sites or services, it is
possible that third parties may unlawfully access such personal information through a
number of means despite our efforts.</p>
