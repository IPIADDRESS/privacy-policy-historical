                <span></span>PRIVACY POLICY - Dated February 2012</h1>
            <h2>What Is A Privacy Policy?</h2>
            <p>
                Nick UK’s privacy policy is just Nick UK’s way of telling you how Nickelodeon UK Ltd (a company incorporated in England registration number 2797365) of 17-29 Hawley Crescent, London NW1 8TT (or any successor and/or associated company) (Nick UK) will collect, store and use any information, which you provide to Nick UK, such as your name, age, address, and telephone number or anything else. It also tells you the choices you can make about how the information you provide to Nick UK is collected and used. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important you read through this policy and be sure to get your parent(s)/guardian(s) to read and discuss it with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                And don’t forget, you should always make sure you get the consent of your parent(s)/guardian(s) before giving any information or sending any materials to anyone, including Nick UK, whether online, by post or in any other way. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Legal And Important Bit</h2>
            <p>
                Nick UK promises to look after and control any information you send Nick UK, whether it's personal information (such as your name, address, date of birth or contact details) or other non-personal information (such as your nickname, your computer's address known as an IP address, views or comments).
            </p>
            <p>
                So whether you register your details on Nick UK's websites, enter competitions, contact Nick UK by phone, send Nick UK SMS messages, interact with Nick UK through red-button applications, voting for your favourite things online or send Nick UK a letter in the post or provide Nick UK with your information any other way, this policy will apply, unless Nick UK tells you otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                By providing Nick UK with your information, you (and your parent(s)/guardian(s)) agree to the terms of this policy. If you (or your parent(s)/guardian(s)) do not agree with this policy, please do not supply any information.
            </p>
            <h2>Interacting With Nick UK</h2>
            <p>
                You can interact with Nick UK in a number of ways but if you want to interact with Nick UK online through Nick UK's websites, it is always a good idea for you and your parent(s)/guardian(s) to spend time online together for your safety and it may even be fun!
            </p>
            <h2>Parent(s)’/Guardian(s)’ Consent and Checks</h2>
            <p>
                If you are under 18, you will ALWAYS need to get your parent(s)/guardian(s) permission before contacting and interacting with Nick UK - whether it's entering one of Nick UK's competitions, sending Nick UK a letter or accessing Nick UK's websites, especially if you are providing Nick UK with personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nick UK may need to check that your parent(s)/guardian(s) are happy for you to provide your information to Nick UK. Where Nick UK does need to check with your parent(s)/guardian(s), Nick UK will ask you for your parent's/guardian's contact details (usually an email address or telephone number) so Nick UK can then contact them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nick UK will always ask for your parent(s)'/guardian(s)' permission where Nick UK wants to use your personal information for marketing or research purposes; to send you Nick UK's newsletter or whether you are allowed to receive the prize and can comply with the competition terms and conditions, if you're lucky enough to be selected to win a competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nick UK may also carry out checks to ensure that the contact details you have provided for your parent(s)/guardian(s) are your actual parent(s)/guardian(s). So no cheating!
            </p>
            <h2>What Happens If Nick UK Does Not Receive My Parent(s)’/Guardian(s)’ Consent?</h2>
            <p>
                If Nick UK:
            </p>
            <p>
                (a) finds out you’ve cheated;
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) discovers you’ve given Nick UK fake details for your parent(s)/guardian(s)
                - very naughty!!; or
            </p>
            <p>
                (c) Nick UK does not get a reply from your parent(s)/guardian(s) within a reasonable
                time (being approximately 5 weeks if you’ve asked to receive Nick UK’s newsletter
                but for competitions, this time period will be a lot shorter, sometimes maybe only
                24 hours);
            </p>
            <p>
                Nick UK will not be able to use your information and will remove your information
                from Nick UK’s database within a reasonable time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This may affect the way you may interact with Nick UK so, for example, you won’t
                be allowed to enter a competition; your use of Nick UK’s websites may be limited;
                or you will not be able to receive any marketing materials.
            </p>
            <h2>Why Does Nick UK Need Your Information?</h2>
            <p>
                A lot of the information Nick UK asks you to provide is to make sure you can
                enjoy all the benefits of Nick UK’s websites or red-button applications or so
                Nick UK can tell you if you’re lucky enough to win one of Nick UK’s competitions.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can, of course, ask Nick UK to remove your information at any time by contacting
                Nick UK.
            </p>
            <h2>What Else Does Nick UK Do With Your Information?</h2>
            <p>
                The information you provide may be used for marketing and research; to provide and
                personalise Nick UK’s service for you; and to send you newsletters and other
                information about Nick UK and our related products and services (marketing materials).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’d like to receive marketing materials from Nick UK such as Nick UK’s
                newsletter, you can either write to Nick UK asking to receive marketing materials
                from Nick UK or you can choose to receive it by ticking the appropriate box
                when providing your details to Nick UK – for example, on Nick UK’s websites,
                as part of the registration process or when entering a competition or otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>It is your choice whether you'd like to receive these marketing materials or not and you can change your mind at any time by contacting Nick UK (as detailed below).</p>
            <p>
                In order to ensure that any marketing materials, which Nick UK provides to you
                are likely to be of interest, Nick UK may also use information collected about
                you from cookies (as described below), surveys, household data and any correspondence
                between you and Nick UK, as well as information you provide when you register
                your details on Nick UK’s websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where Nick UK uses your personal information for such marketing materials, Nick UK
                will ask your parent(s)’/guardian(s)’ permission first BUT where Nick UK does
                not use your personal information and just uses your non-personal information, Nick UK
                will not ask your parent(s)/guardian(s) for their permission.
            </p>
            <h2>Who Else May Have Access To My Information?</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes Nick UK needs third parties to carry out a service for it. For example
                if you win a competition, Nick UK may need to pass your information to a third
                party to arrange delivery of your prize or need advice from any auditor or legal
                adviser. Nick UK will make sure that these third parties keep your information
                secure; only keep the information for so long as is necessary; and will comply with
                all UK and EU legislation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from the above, Nick UK will only pass on your information to third parties
                if:
            </p>
            <p>
                • Nick UK has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary
                for legal proceedings;
            </p>
            <p>
                • the information is generic and doesn’t identify you, such as whether you’re a
                boy or girl and how you watch Nick UK’s programmes. Nick UK may use such
                information (in whole or in part) to identify trends and may pass this to third
                parties such as advertisers and business partners to give them a better understanding
                of Nick UK’s business.
            </p>
            <h2>International Use Of Your Information</h2>
            <p>
                As Nick UK and its associated companies operate throughout the world, it may
                be necessary to transfer your information outside of the UK or even Europe. If Nick UK
                needs to do this, Nick UK promises that any of Nick UK’s associated companies
                will comply with UK and/or European law in respect of data protection and will comply
                with the terms of this policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In particular, Nick UK may transfer your information to its associated companies in the United States, such as Nick US. These companies comply with a US-EU agreement called Safe Harbor, which ensures that US companies satisfy European laws about how your information is used. More information on the Safe Harbor Privacy Policy can be found here.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your information is passed on to any international third parties, Nick UK will make sure that they also subscribe to Safe Harbor principles, satisfy European laws or agree in writing to provide the same level of protection as the Safe Harbor principles.

            </p>
            <h2>Cookies and IP Addresses – What Are They?</h2>
            <p>
                For information please see our <a href="/info/cookie">Cookie Policy</a>
            </p>

            <h2>Links To Other Websites
            </h2>
            <p>
                When you’re on one of Nick UK’s websites, you may be directed to other sites
                where your information may be collected and this will be outside the control of
                Nick UK. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement on one of Nick UK’s
                websites, it may take you from Nick UK’s website to a third party’s website.
                Nick UK cannot be responsible for or control the content on another party’s
                website and don’t forget that once you’ve left Nick UK’s website, if you provide
                any information to the third party, you will need to check their privacy policy
                as this policy only applies to Nick UK websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important that you stay safe online and if you’d like more information about
                this then please talk to your parent(s)/guardian(s).
            </p>
            <h2>Changes To This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                Nick UK may change this policy from time to time and will post the latest version
                on Nick UK’s websites. If Nick UK wishes to use your information in a way
                which is incompatible with the information in this policy, Nick UK will contact
                you (and your parent(s)/guardian(s)) to get your consent.
            </p>
