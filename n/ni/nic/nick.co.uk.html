	 <td class="privacy"> <p align="justify"><span class="legalHeader">Nick.co.uk 
	   Privacy Policy </span></p>
	  <p align="justify">Nick.co.uk (“Site”) is the place in cyberspace 
	   where fans of Nickelodeon UK can come to find out more about their favourite 
	   Nick stars, play games and have their opinions heard. Nickelodeon UK believes 
	   in the power of kids and we urge both them and their parents to use and 
	   enjoy our Site. Whilst we encourage the interactive nature of online media, 
	   we strive to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard 
	   their privacy when travelling on the web. Our information collection practices 
	   are described below. <b>We urge kids to check with their parents before 
	   entering any information on any website and we urge parents to discuss 
	   with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information 
	   to anyone they don't know. </b></p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>What Information Is Collected?<br>
	   <br>
	   </b>At Nickelodeon UK, it is our policy to create website content which 
	   requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. Generally, 
	   Nickelodeon UK limits collection of information to what is known as non-personally 
	   identifiable information (e.g. first name, age, birthday, gender, city 
	   or town). This information is collected so kids can participate in activities 
	   without giving out unnecessary personal information. Where we need extra 
	   information, e.g. kids'/parents' email addresses, telephone numbers (as 
	   explained below) to run competitions or to offer extra on-line activities, 
	   we let kids know the reason for which we are collecting the information 
	   and what we will do with it. We do not as a condition to a kid's participation 
	   in any of our on-line activity require the disclosure of more information 
	   than is reasonably necessary. </p>
	  <p align="justify">The data controller for the purposes of UK data protection 
	   legislation is Nickelodeon UK (“we” or “us” or 
	   “our”). The ways we collect user’s (“you” 
	   or “your” or “user”) personal information and how 
	   we use it on the Site are as follows:</p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>1. Registration <br>
	   <br>
	   </b>The main way we collect personally identifiable information is through 
	   our registration process. In order to take part in our registered member 
	   activities, we ask kids to submit personal information such as full name, 
	   email address, postcode and birthday and we ask each kid if they wish to 
	   opt-in to receiving emails from us as part of our activities for registered 
	   members e.g. our newsletter. We remind them to ask a parent/guardian for 
	   permission first. The information is used to allow kids to take part in 
	   registered member activities such as message boards, newsletters, any special 
	   member competitions and send postcards. Registered kids can unsubscribe 
	   at any time. To unsubscribe, please contact us at the following email address: 
	   <a href="mailto:standards@nick.co.uk">standards@nick.co.uk </a>. <br>
	   <br>
	   All such personal information collected during the registration process 
	   is used only for the purpose of providing kids with access to our registered 
	   member activities. It is not currently our policy to use such information 
	   for general marketing purposes or to share such information with third 
	   parties (except in relation to competitions as set out below or where we 
	   are required to do so by law or in the context of a business transfer). 
	   Should our policy on this change, we will let you know and give you the 
	   choice to be included. <br>
	   <br>
	   We do not obtain or require disclosure of sensitive personal data (such 
	   as ethnic origin or religion) but if you choose to provide us with such 
	   sensitive personal data, we may assume such sensitive personal data is 
	   provided with your express consent for processing by us for the purposes 
	   for which such personal data was provided by you unless otherwise notified 
	   by you to us in writing at the following email address: <a href="mailto:standards@nick.co.uk">standards@nick.co.uk</a> 
	   . </p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>2. Competitions<br>
	   <br>
	   </b>We offer the opportunity to all kids to enter competitions on-line. 
	   In order to run competitions and send out prizes, it is necessary to collect 
	   some personally identifiable information from kids. This can include name, 
	   address and telephone number. As a matter of policy, we keep such information 
	   only for the purposes of administering the competition and do not disclose 
	   such information to third parties except where necessary to fulfill the 
	   prizes (e.g. it may be shared with fulfillment houses for processing purposes). 
	   We may from time to time offer competitions sponsored by third party businesses 
	   and may share entrant information with such businesses in order to fulfill 
	   the competition only. We will provide potential entrants with the opportunity 
	   to opt-in to such third party sponsored competitions. Once a competition 
	   is finished, we will delete any personal information collected via on-line 
	   entry forms from our systems and it is not kept for any longer than is 
	   necessary. </p>
	  <p align="justify"></p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>3. Electronic Postcards<br>
	   <br>
	   </b>We may give kids the option to send "electronic postcards" 
	   to their friends. We do not collect our visitors' full names, but we do 
	   collect email addresses during this process in order to inform the user 
	   that their postcard has been read. We also ask users to submit their friends' 
	   email addresses so we can send them these e-cards. We think it would be 
	   disproportionate to inform user’s friend(s) about our privacy policy 
	   and how we will be using their personal data beforehand because it would 
	   spoil the surprise of receiving the friend’s electronic postcard. 
	   However, we can reassure users that this data is not transferred to a third 
	   party or used for marketing purposes and it is not kept for any longer 
	   than is necessary. </p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>4. Feedback<br>
	   <br>
	   </b>We provide kids with the opportunity to email us with their opinions 
	   and comments. We request no personally identifiable information unless 
	   the kid indicates that he or she wants us to reply. In these circumstances, 
	   we ask for a first name and email address. This information is used solely 
	   by us in order to give requested feedback and is then deleted from our 
	   system periodically. </p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>5. Cookies and Log Data<br>
	   <br>
	   </b>Cookies are information files that your web browser places on the hard 
	   drive of your computer when you visit certain websites. We are able to 
	   access only the cookies that our Site places on your computer and we are 
	   only able to determine the type of computer operating system and browser 
	   that you are using. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read 
	   information from a user's hard drive. Cookies allow websites to "remember" 
	   users activities on a website as well as users visits to a website. At 
	   Nick.co.uk, cookies are used to determine the number of unique visitors 
	   to our Site over a given period. We do not store any personal information 
	   in the cookies nor do we link or combine information collected through 
	   cookies to any personal information submitted by users when participating 
	   in our activities. We collect this information in order to improve access 
	   to our content based on our visitors' browsers and operating system types 
	   to make our content available to as many kids as possible. You can, of 
	   course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences 
	   or options menus in your browser. </p>
	  <p align="justify">Log data collected on web servers within our control 
	   also supplies us with non-personally identifiable information about the 
	   number of visits to different pages on our Site. We use this information 
	   only for improving our Site. We do not link the "log data" collected 
	   to personally identifiable information submitted by users when participating 
	   in our activities. </p>
	  <p align="justify">The information collected through cookies and log data 
	   may be passed to our Research Department or to third party advertisers 
	   or business partners. </p>
	  <p align="justify">If you do not wish us to use cookies for the purposes 
	   explained above, please inform us in writing at the following email address: 
	   <a href="mailto:standards@nick.co.uk">standards@nick.co.uk</a> .</p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>6. Transfer of Personal Data<br>
	   <br>
	   </b>We may also transfer your personal data collected to any country, including 
	   countries outside the European Economic Area, for any of the purposes described 
	   above. Your provision of personal data to us through use of this Site is 
	   understood by us to constitute consent to such transfer unless you inform 
	   us of your wish not to transfer your personal data in this manner at the 
	   following email address: <a href="mailto:standards@nick.co.uk">standards@nick.co.uk 
	   </a>.</p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>7. Monitoring of Communications<br>
	   <br>
	   </b>We may record or monitor your telephone conversations and email correspondence 
	   with our staff for security, compliance with the law, training purposes 
	   and to maintain and improve the quality of our services.</p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>8. Security<br>
	   <br>
	   </b>We have taken steps to ensure that all personally identifiable information 
	   that we collect is secure, including limiting the number of people who 
	   have physical access to our database servers as well as electronic security 
	   systems and password protections, which guard against unauthorised access. 
	  </p>
	  <p align="justify"><br>
	   <b>9. Agents<br>
	   <br>
	   </b>The personally identifiable information provided to Nick.co.uk may 
	   be transferred, disclosed or shared with third parties who may be engaged 
	   by us as data processors to specifically to handle and deliver certain 
	   activities (e.g. message boards, competitions, e-cards, newsletters, advisory 
	   board, communities) and perform other technical and processing functions, 
	   such as sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information 
	   from registration lists, programming, providing services to our users, 
	   or otherwise operating our Site. They have access to personal information 
	   needed to perform their processing functions, but may not use it for other 
	   purposes.</p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>10. Third party websites</b><br>
	   <br>
	   We provide a "bumper page" when linking from our Site to an advertiser's 
	   site, which lets kids know they are going to an advertiser's site and reminds 
	   them not to give out information online without getting permission from 
	   their parents. Kids and their parents should be aware that other sites 
	   have different policies on collection of information to us, so it is important 
	   to check their Privacy Policies before submitting any personally identifiable 
	   information. </p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>11. Business Transfers<br>
	   <br>
	   </b>In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are transferred 
	   or sold to another business, you agree that we may transfer any of your 
	   personally identifiable information to the acquiring business.</p>
	  <p align="justify"><b>12. Questions/Concerns?</b><br>
