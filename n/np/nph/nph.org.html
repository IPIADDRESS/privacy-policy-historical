					<li><a name="2b"></a><h4>Personal Information</h4><p>Some information that may be identifiable as yours (your "Personal Information") is not gathered automatically at the NPH  Site. If you wish to provide Personal Information, you must do so voluntarily, and may do so in a number of ways. The following are some of the kinds of Personal Information NPH.org gathers:</p></li>

					</ol>
					<li><a name="2c"></a><h4>Cookies</h4><p>Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a users web browser on the hard drive of a users computer. Cookies can "remember" what information ("Cookie Information") a user accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user, or can use that information to streamline the users transactions on related websites. The Cookies NPH.org uses do not capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information, but do permit NPH.org to send focused advertising and marketing materials, new services, promotions or other such responses to you or to assist you with your use of the NPH Site. NPH.org may also set Cookies when you register or when you acquire goods or services from the NPH Site, and may do so without notice to or permission from you or any third party.

				<ol type="A">
					<li><a name="3a"></a><h4>General Information</h4><p>NPH.org uses and discloses General Information to understand NPH Site demographics and content preferences, and shall do so without notice to, or permission from, you or any third party.

Such third party websites may include websites that are owned by third parties or that are "co-branded" sites of NPH.org;</p></li>
					<li><a name="4b"></a><h4>Pre-Population Information</h4><p>When you come to the NPH Site from a third party website, or when you hyperlink from the NPH Site to a third party website, and in either case provide Personal Information at that third party website, NPH.org may obtain that Personal Information (pursuant to an agreement between NPH.org and that third party), and use that Personal Information to populate the NPH Site registration forms in order to save you time in completing NPH Site registration forms; and</p></li>
