				<li><h3><a name="2"></a>Information</h3><p>NPH.org obtains information from and about you in a number of ways, including:</p></li>
				<ol type="A">
					<li><a name="2a"></a><h4>General Information</h4><p>Some information ("General Information") is gathered automatically when you access the NPH  Site. This General Information (which includes NPH Site pages visited, type of web browser used, type of operating system, and the domain name of your Internet service provider, and similar information) does not identify you personally. </p></li>
					<li><a name="2b"></a><h4>Personal Information</h4><p>Some information that may be identifiable as yours (your "Personal Information") is not gathered automatically at the NPH  Site. If you wish to provide Personal Information, you must do so voluntarily, and may do so in a number of ways. The following are some of the kinds of Personal Information NPH.org gathers:</p></li>
					<ol type="i">		
						<li><a name="2bi"></a><h4>Sponsorship Information</h4><p>If you decide to register at the NPH  Site as a sponsor, you will be asked for certain Personal Information, such as your name, your address, work and home telephone numbers, your email address, preferences regarding sponsorship: (1) male or female child; (2) age of the child; (3) amount and frequency of sponsorship donation; and (4) other information;</p></li>
						<li><a name="2bii"></a><h4>Third Party Information</h4><p>When you register at a third party website and provide Personal Information to such third parties, NPH.org may (pursuant to agreements between NPH.org and those third parties) obtain such information to populate NPH Site registration forms for use when you hyperlink to the NPH Site;</p></li>

						<li><a name="2biv"></a><h4>Email Information</h4><p>When you send us email messages, we may retain the content of your email messages, together with your email address and our response to you.</p></li>
					</ol>
					<li><a name="2c"></a><h4>Cookies</h4><p>Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a users web browser on the hard drive of a users computer. Cookies can "remember" what information ("Cookie Information") a user accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user, or can use that information to streamline the users transactions on related websites. The Cookies NPH.org uses do not capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information, but do permit NPH.org to send focused advertising and marketing materials, new services, promotions or other such responses to you or to assist you with your use of the NPH Site. NPH.org may also set Cookies when you register or when you acquire goods or services from the NPH Site, and may do so without notice to or permission from you or any third party. Third party websites which are accessible from the NPH Site via links, banner ads, or "click-throughs" may also use Cookies, and NPH.org shall have no responsibility whatsoever for such Cookies.</p></li>
				</ol>
				<li><h3><a name="3"></a>General Use and Disclosure of Information</h3><p>NPH.org uses and discloses your information that it collects as follows:</p></li>
				<ol type="A">
					<li><a name="3a"></a><h4>General Information</h4><p>NPH.org uses and discloses General Information to understand NPH Site demographics and content preferences, and shall do so without notice to, or permission from, you or any third party.

					<li><a name="3b"></a><h4>Personal Information</h4><p>As further provided in Section 3 ("Other Use and Disclosure of Personal Information"), NPH uses Personal Information for purposes of administering NPH charitable activities. This may include, but is not limited to, directed communications to donors, distribution of newsletters, invitations to special events, to prepare internal reports, to maintain donor/sponsorship files, and to assist with responses to your questions and concerns.

We may also disclose any of your information when legally compelled to do so, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. The following are some of the ways in which we may use or disclose your Personal Information to third parties:</p></li>
				<ol type="A">
					<li><a name="4a"></a><h4>Registration Information</h4><p>NPH.org may transfer the Personal Information you provide to NPH.org during the NPH Site registration process to affiliated third parties for those parties to use to populate their own website registration forms when you hyperlink from the NPH Site to their websites, to save you time in completing their registration forms. Such third party websites may include websites that are owned by third parties or that are "co-branded" sites of NPH.org;</p></li>
					<li><a name="4b"></a><h4>Pre-Population Information</h4><p>When you come to the NPH Site from a third party website, or when you hyperlink from the NPH Site to a third party website, and in either case provide Personal Information at that third party website, NPH.org may obtain that Personal Information (pursuant to an agreement between NPH.org and that third party), and use that Personal Information to populate the NPH Site registration forms in order to save you time in completing NPH Site registration forms; and</p></li>
				</ol>
				<li><h3><a name="5"></a>Security</h3><p>You understand and agree that "perfect" security does not exist anywhere, including the Internet.
