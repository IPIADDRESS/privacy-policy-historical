<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>At npower, we’re committed to providing you with unbeatable value and 
  an excellent service. So, we collect the information that you give us when you 
  contact us. Then we use it to provide you with any goods or services requested, 
  to administer your accounts, for risk assessment, for marketing, to analyse 
  your account histories and to generally improve our service to you. We may also 
  contact credit reference agencies who will record the search. If we intend to 
  use information for any other purposes we'll tell you when we collect it and 
  you'll have at least 30 days to object. This privacy policy only covers npower's 
  websites and the links within these sites to our half hourly online service. 
  Links within these sites to other websites are not covered by this policy. </p>
<h2>
  Data security protection</h2>
<p>All npower companies comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. We only use 
  personal data fairly and lawfully, and ensure that it is kept secure. Nothing 
  is stored online and our systems are extremely well protected. And, we will 
  not pass the information that you give us to any organisations beyond npower 
  Limited, our associated and subsidiary companies and our agents and service 
  providers, unless we inform you otherwise and you don't object. </p>
<h2>What do we collect? </h2>
<p>We collect the information requested by our contact forms, together with any 
  comments or ideas that you may send us. And we monitor site traffic. Discovering 
  the pages that are of most interest to you means that we can make them more 
  accessible. We will (unless it's impractical) tell you, if we obtain and store 
  information from any other source and also, how we intend to use it. </p>
<h2>How can you find out what is stored about you?</h2>
<p>Just ask us! You can e-mail us at customer.data@npower.com or write to The 
  Data Protection Officer, Database Operations, npower Ltd, Oak House, Bridgwater 
  Road, Worcester, WR4 9FP.</p>
<p>The information that you request will be provided within a maximum of 40 working 
  days. We try to ensure that the information we hold is accurate, up to date 
  and relevant and we'll be happy to correct any inaccuracies. </p>
<h2>What are cookies? </h2>
<p>Cookies are files that are recorded in temporary Internet folders on your PC.</p>
<p>They’re a useful tool because they enable us to get to know you better, 
  by recording the way you use npower.com. We’re able to identify your preferences 
  and provide you with a more relevant customer experience. </p>
<p>Like most web sites, npower.com uses a Unique Visitor Cookie (which is supplied 
  and managed by a carefully selected statistics provider) to identify your PC 
  by a random number (eg #12489). It records no personal data. </p>
<p>Cookies also enable us to provide you with certain facilities, like the savings 
  calculator and the wish list in the homemover section. </p>
<p>A credit checking cookie also enables businesses to take advantage of npower 
  credit checking service offers. </p>
<h2>What about e-mail? </h2>
<p>If you’ve said you’re happy for us to correspond with you by e-mail 
  – we will. But should you, for whatever reason, decide you no longer want 
  to receive e-mail from us, you’ll be able to “unsubscribe” 
  immediately. </p>

<h2>And if we update our privacy policy? </h2>
<p>You’ll be able to read about it on this page – as soon as it happens. 
</p>
<h2>External links</h2>
<p>From time to time npower include hypertext links to sites which are created 
  by individuals and companies outside npower. We do this when there is a particular 
  relevance to the topic you're reading about. And whilst we endeavour to check 
  that the content of these sites is suitable, we unfortunately cannot take any 
  responsibility for the practices of the companies who publish the sites that 
  we link to, nor the integrity of the content contained within them.</p>
