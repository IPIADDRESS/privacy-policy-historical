  <p><strong><a name="memberSurveys" id="memberSurveys"></a>Member Surveys</strong> <br>
    <br>
          NPD surveys collect a wide variety of information on a diverse range of current topics. Your participation in our surveys is always voluntary.
          However, once you have submitted survey responses to NPD, those responses cannot be recalled or altered. The information collected through NPD's
          surveys is used only for statistical and classification purposes in aggregated or summary form and is NOT shared, sold or used on an individual basis.
          The information we collect is stored and processed in our data processing facility, which is currently located in New Jersey, U.S.A.  </p>


  <p><strong><a name="dataRetention" id="dataRetention"></a>Data Retention</strong> <br>
    <br>
         We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you surveys and/or rewards. We will also retain and use
         your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  If you wish to cancel your membership

  <p><strong><a name="sweepRewards" id="sweepRewards"></a>Sweepstakes and Rewards</strong> <br>
    <br>
         Panelists who are legal residents of the 50 United States (and the District of Columbia) or Canada, and 13 years or older at the time of enrollment are
         eligible to join SweepLand, NPDOR's fee-free Sweepstakes program where panelists earn points for completing eligible surveys and can use those points
         as entries into sweepstakes on <a href="http://www.sweepland.com" target="_blank">www.sweepland.com</a>.  A NPDOR panelist must complete a one-time
         SweepLand registration in order to activate their SweepLand account. SweepLand registration information, including your name and mailing address, is
         collected solely to ensure that we can deliver prizes to sweepstakes winners and to keep members informed of SweepLand program updates / happenings.
         SweepLand membership is not required to be a member of the NPDOR panel.  For complete SweepLand Terms and Conditions, please
         <a href="http://sweepland.com/Terms_Cond.aspx" target="blank">click here</a>.  <br>
         <br>
         By responding to a survey which includes a sweepstakes offer, or by enrolling in SweepLand, you agree to let NPD share your contact information
         (e-mail address) with an independent third-party sweepstakes administrator. Your contact information is used by the administrator only to let you know
         if you have won a sweepstakes or to communicate program information. To receive your prize, you will be required to submit and/or verify certain
         information to the administrator (e.g. name and mailing address). This information is used only to mail your prize to you. When claiming prizes, winners
         also complete an online affidavit, which gives NPD permission to post winners' names and state or country of residence.<br>
         <br>
         NPD may also from time to time offer you the opportunity to claim cash rewards or other incentives for completed surveys. To receive your reward, you
         may be required to submit and/or verify certain information (e.g. name and mailing address) to an independent third-party administrator, so it may
         provide your reward to you.  </p>
