							<p>The National Portrait Gallery is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Notice sets out which information is collected about you by the Gallery, how we use it and the choices and controls you have.</p>
<p>We will never sell, rent or exchange your details with any other organisation outside the National Portrait Gallery without your prior consent.</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice has been prepared to be as comprehensive as possible, but it does not include an exhaustive list of every aspect of our collection and use of personal information. However, we would be happy to provide any further information or explanation about our practices. If you have any general queries or concerns about this policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:DPO@npg.org.uk">DPO@npg.org.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Notice</h2>
<p>From time to time the Gallery will change this privacy notice. You may therefore wish to check this page each time you submit personal information to the Gallery. The latest privacy notice will always appear on this page.</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice was last updated in May 2018.</p>
<p>Please note, this Privacy Notice is currently under review and will be updated shortly.</p>
<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>This Privacy Notice applies to the National Portrait Gallery, London (NPG). The Gallery was founded in 1856 to collect and display portraits of people who have contributed to British history and culture. Today the Gallery’s Collection is among the largest and most prestigious collections of portraits in the world. The Gallery is a Non-Departmental Public Body supported by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and is an exempt charity under the Charities Act 2011. You can find out more about the functions the Gallery by reading our statement of public task here [link to https://www.npg.org.uk/about/corporate/gallery-policies/statement-of-public-task]</p>
<p>The National Portrait Gallery Company Limited (Company Number <em>06015724</em>) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Gallery, which was set up to generate income to help the Gallery meet its overall aims and objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gallery’s address is 2 St Martin’s Place, London, WC2H 0HE.</p>
<p>Under this notice, ‘we’, ‘NPG’ and ‘the Gallery’ refers to both the National Portrait Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery Company Limited.</p>
<h2>Data Protection</h2>
<p>The Gallery will only use your personal information in accordance with this Notice, its Data Protection Policy, and relevant data protection laws including the General Data Protection Regulation, Data Protection Act 2018 and any reiteration of relevant legislations. Our Data Protection registration number is Z5637141. Please see our Data Protection Policy here <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/about/corporate/gallery-policies/data-protection-policy">www.npg.org.uk/about/corporate/gallery-policies/data-protection-policy</a></p>
<h2>Our legal bases for processing your data</h2>
<p>Under data protection law, we need a lawful basis to collect and use your personal data. The law allows for six ways to process personal data. All of these are relevant to the types of processing that we carry out. This includes information that is processed on the basis of:</p>
<ol>
<li>a person’s consent (for example, if you consent to receive our e-newsletter)</li>
<li>a contractual relationship (for example, to provide you with goods or services that you have purchased from us, such as a ticket or Membership)</li>
<li>complying with a legal obligation (for example to process a Gift Aid declaration, or carrying out due diligence on large donations)</li>
<li>the Gallery’s public functions as defined by DCMS (for example, in maintaining and providing access to our collections)</li>
<li>protecting an individual’s vital interests (for example, to ensure the safety of staff and visitors to the Gallery)</li>
<li>the legitimate interests of the Gallery, you as an individual, or wider benefits to society (please see below for more information)</li>
</ol>
<p>Personal data may be legally collected and used if it is necessary for a legitimate interest of the organisation using the data, if its use is fair, and if it does not adversely impact the rights and freedoms of the individual concerned.</p>
<p>When we use your personal information, we will always consider if it is fair and balanced to do so and if it is within your reasonable expectations. We will balance your rights and our legitimate interests to ensure that we use your personal information responsibly and in ways that are not unduly intrusive or unfair.</p>
<p>If you would like more information on our use of legitimate interests, or to change our use of your personal data in this manner, please get in touch with us by contact our Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:DPO@npg.org.uk">DPO@npg.org.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>We want to ensure you remain in control of your personal data and that you understand your legal rights, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the right to know whether we hold your personal data and, if we do so, to be sent a copy of the personal data that we hold about you (a ‘Subject Access Request’/SAR) within one month;</li>
<li>the right to have inaccurate or incomplete personal data updated or amended;</li>
<li>the right to have your personal data erased (though this will not apply where it is necessary for us to continue to use the data for a lawful or legitimate reason); and</li>
<li>the right to object to your personal data being used for marketing or profiling.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some exceptions to the rights above and, although we will always try to respond to any instructions you give us about our handling of your personal information, there may be situations where we are unable to meet your requirements in full.</p>
<p>If you would like further information on your rights or wish to exercise them, please contact our Data Protection Officer (details below).</p>
<p>It is important that the information we hold about you is accurate, therefore please let us know of any changes to the personal information you give to us. Please also get in touch if you wish to know what personal information we hold about you or how we process your information. This is your right of access and is known as a Subject Access Request (SAR). To submit a SAR you can contact us by email at DPO@npg.org.uk, or write to us at Data Protection Officer, National Portrait Gallery, St Martin’s Place, London, WC2H 0HE. Please note you will be asked to provide proof of identification.</p>
<h2>Questions and complaints</h2>
<p>Should you have a question or complaint about how we have used (‘processed’) your personal data, you can contact us directly by contacting our Data Protection Officer in the first instance via email at <a href="mailto:DPO@npg.org.uk">DPO@npg.org.uk</a>, or by writing to Data Protection Officer, National Portrait Gallery, St Martin’s Place, London, WC2H 0HE</p>
<p>If you are not happy with our response, or you believe that your data protection or privacy rights have been infringed, you can complain to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) which regulates and enforces data protection law in the UK. Details of how to do this can be found at <a href="http://www.ico.org.uk">http://www.ico.org.uk</a></p>
<h2>Disclosure of your information</h2>
<p>We occasionally&nbsp;use third party data processors for the purpose of distributing communication materials (e.g. a mailing house). Where we do this, we will always ensure the third party organisation enters into a suitable data processing agreement to ensure your personal information will be processed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 and any reiteration of relevant legislations.</p>
<p>We will disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation; or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Gallery, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection.</p>
<h2>External suppliers</h2>
<p>In some cases we work with external suppliers to provide certain services. All data is transferred securely and all external suppliers have signed data processing and confidentiality agreements with the Gallery.</p>
<h2>Storage of your information</h2>
<p>The Gallery’s preference is that data we collect from you is stored in the UK/EU (European Union). Where your data is transferred and stored outside the UK/EU we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that any data processor we use provides an adequate level of protection for your data. The transmission of information via the Internet, unfortunately, is not completely secure, and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to help prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<h2>Statistical Information</h2>
<p>The Gallery will keep records of a statistical nature where personal data will be anonymised, in order to improve our provided services.</p>

<p>Operating under Public Task, if you make a donation, we will use the personal information you give us to record the nature and amount of your gift, claim gift aid where you’ve told us you’re eligible and thank you for your gift. If you interact or have a conversation with us, we’ll note anything relevant and store this securely on our systems.</p>
<p>If you choose to Gift Aid your donation, your Membership or Patronage, we have a legal obligation to provide your name and address to HMRC in order to fulfil the gift aid claim.<br>Occasionally, we will invite some supporters to attend special events to find out more about the ways in which donations and gifts in wills can make a difference to specific projects and to our cause. We will also send you updates on the impact that you make by supporting us in this way, unless you tell us not to.<br> <br>If you tell us you want to fundraise to support our cause, we will use the personal information you give us to record your plans and contact you to support your fundraising efforts.<br>If you have told us that you’re planning to, or thinking about, leaving us a gift in your will, we will use the information you give us to keep a record of this – including the purpose of your gift, if you let us know this. If we have a conversation or interaction with you (or with someone who contacts us in relation to your will, for example your solicitor), we will note these interactions throughout your relationship with us, as this helps to ensure your gift is directed as you wanted.</p>
<p>Charity Commission rules require us to be assured of the provenance of funds and any conditions attached to them. To meet this legal obligation, we follow a due diligence process which involves researching the financial soundness, credibility, reputation and ethical principles of donors who have made, or are likely to make, a significant donation to the National Portrait Gallery. For more information on our due diligence processes please see our Grants and Donations Policy</p>

<h2>Supporter Research &amp; Analysis</h2>
<p>We want to meet with or deepen our connection to, individuals and organisations who might have an interest in our work. We are committed to nurturing collaborative relationships with donors, influencers, prospective donors and others so that together we can grow and sustain the Gallery for generations to come. </p>
<p>To enable us to find and connect with people with a passion for art, history or creative education projects and the interest and ability to support us in new and exciting ways, we may also use the information you provide to us in combination with publicly available information, if we consider it within our legitimate interests to do so.</p>
<p>Our Major Gifts team uses information that is already in the public domain (information that has been published in print or online) to identify high net worth individuals who may be interested in supporting our work with a major gift. These publicly available sources of information include Companies House, the electoral register, the phone book, the Charity Commission’s Register of Charities, Who’s Who, LinkedIn, company annual reports, and articles in newspapers and magazines. We do not use publicly available sources which we consider would be intrusive for this purpose, such as Facebook, Twitter, JustGiving, the Land Registry, online planning applications, or similar websites. We also carry out research to identify existing supporters who may be able to join our major donor programme. This is based both on publicly available information, and information our supporters have given us voluntarily (e.g. where a person lives, who they bank with, what their occupation is and their age).</p>
<p>Occasionally we will work with a third party processor, Search &amp; Prosper to carry out this research on our behalf. Please see a copy of their Privacy Policy <a href="assets/files/pdf/policy/Search_Prosper_Privacy_Policy.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>We may use profiling and database segmentation techniques to analyse your personal information, and create a profile of your interests, preferences and ability to donate. This allows us to ensure communications are relevant and timely, to provide an improved experience for our supporters. It also helps us understand our supporters so that we can make appropriate requests to those who may be willing and able to donate more than they already do, or leave a gift in their will. This enables us to raise funds in the most cost-effective way.</p>
<p>Under data protection legislation, you have the right to object to your data being processed in this way. If you wish to opt out of being identified as a high net worth individual, or to review or amend your personal data please contact <a href="mailto:maram@npg.org.uk"><strong>maram@npg.org.uk</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Please remember we are legally required to carry out checks on individuals who give us large donations, to comply with our legal obligation in respect of anti-money laundering legislation and the prevention of fraud.</p>
