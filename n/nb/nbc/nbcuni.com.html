<strong>Introduction:</strong> These websites which are  located at the domain nbcuni.com (the “Site”) are operated by NBCUniversal. (“NBCUniversal” or “we” or “our” or “us”).   Your privacy  is important  to us.

<p><a name="typesofinformation"></a><strong>1. Types of Information Collected:</strong><br>
<strong>Personal Data: </strong>Personally Identifiable  Information  (“Personal Data”) is any information that can be used to identify a   specific individual, such as your name, email address, home address,  phone  number and credit card information.  This Site collects Personal  Data when  you interact with the Site for example when you subscribe for  newsletters;  register for membership services such as chat rooms or  message boards;  participate in chat rooms, blogs or other user forums;  respond to polls or  surveys; purchase merchandise via the Site;  register for sweepstakes, contests  and other promotional opportunities;  or seek help from our customer service  departments.  We also may  collect information when you purchase products  or services offline, or  register for wireless services via your cellphone or  other wireless  devices (”Other Services”).  Because providing detailed  information  regarding our privacy policy when you register or provide  information  in connection with these Other Services often proves impractical,  you  may instead be provided with a short notice that reminds you to refer to   this Privacy Policy and other relevant information from us.  We may  also  obtain Personal Data from reputable third parties, such as credit  agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate and Anonymous Data:</strong> Aggregate and  anonymous  data is information that does not identify you specifically  including data  collected automatically through the operation of the  Site (“AA Data”).  We  may collect site usage data (such as which Site  pages you visit and in what  sequence) through the use of various  technologies.  For example, we  collect IP addresses from individuals  who visit the Site.  An IP address  is a number that is automatically  assigned to your computer whenever you’re  surfing the Web.  Web  servers, the computers that “serve up” Web  pages, automatically  identify your computer by its IP address, and when you  request a page  from a website, its servers log your IP address.  We do not  link IP  addresses to any Personal Data, so although your session will be   logged, you will remain anonymous to us and the Site.  We may also  collect  password information from you when you log in, as well as  computer and  connection information such as browser type or version.   During some  visits, we may use software tools, such as Javascript, to  measure and collect  session information, including page response times,  download errors, time spent  on certain pages, page interaction  information, and methods used to browse away  from the page.</p>
<p><a name="useofcookies"></a> <strong>2. Use of Cookies and Similar  Technologies:</strong><br>
Like many sites, we use “cookies” or other similar  technologies to  collect AA Data.  A cookie is a small data file that  writes to your  hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit the  Site.   Cookies allow the Site to measure traffic activity on the Site and  to  improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords  and  viewing preferences, allowing you to visit “member only” portions  of the Site  without re-registering, and tracking the progress and  number of entries in  activities that require registration or entry,  such as sweepstakes. Similarly,  if you have asked us to send you  information about upcoming products and  promotions, using cookies we  collect information about which Site pages you  have visited and in what  order (“Clickstream Data”) that may allow us to narrow  or limit the  materials provided to you based on your prior online activities or   preferences.   Most browsers are initially set to accept  cookies.  If  you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to  alert you  when cookies are being sent, but it is possible that some parts of  the  Site will not function properly if you do so.</p>
<p>In addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely  by using  so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar  means  (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) embedded in the Site’s content.  A  Pixel Tag  is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1×1), that is  ordinarily not  visible to Site visitors and may be associated with  cookies on the visitors’  hard drives.   This information is AA data.</p>
<p><a name="ouruseofyourdata"></a> <strong>3. Our Use of Your Data:</strong><br>
<strong>Personal Data:</strong> We will use your Personal Data for  the  purposes for which it was provided.  For example, if you provide  Personal  Data to register for a newsletter or a text messaging service,  to enter a  contest or a sweepstake, or to purchase goods or services,  we will use it to  register you for or provide you with those goods or  services.   We  may also use your Personal Data to provide you with  information about features,  services and other offerings that may be of  interest to you.  We also may  send information or offers to selected  groups of Site users on behalf of other  businesses.  When we do this,  we do not give those businesses your name or  address.  Under certain  circumstances (for example if you win a contest)  we may post your  Personal Data on the Site.  We will notify you of this  possibility when  you provide the Personal Data and, if possible, when the  Personal Data  is posted.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar tools may be used to relate your use of  the Site and AA  Data to Personal Data obtained from you.  If any AA  Data is linked with  Personal Data, the linked AA Data will then be  treated as Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>AA Data:</strong> We may also use Personal Data in aggregate  form  for purposes of research or analysis.  In order to better  understand and  serve the users of the Site and Other Services, NBC  Universal often conducts research on its  customer demographics,  interests and behavior based on Personal Data we  gather.  Although this  aggregated data may be based in part on Personal  Data, it does not  identify you personally.  NBC Universal may share this type of AA Data  with a  variety of third parties, including its affiliates, agents, and  current and  prospective business partners.</p>
<p>We may use AA Data collected from the Site for site  administration, advertising  and promotional purposes, and we may share  such information with various  affiliated and unaffiliated entities for  such purposes.  For example, IP  addresses are used for the purposes of  system administration and to provide AA  Data to advertisers about the  volume of use on the Site, and Clickstream Data  and demographic AA Data  may be shared with our advertisers and business  partners.  We may also  enter into agreements with outside companies that  possess technology  that allows the Site to customize the advertising and  marketing  messages you receive on the Site.  This data (including  Clickstream  Data about your activities on our Site) may be shared with these   companies for this purpose.</p>
<p><a name="disclosureofpersonaldata"></a> <strong>4. Disclosure of Personal Data:</strong><br>
<strong>Disclosure to Affiliates:</strong> We reserve the right to  share Personal Data with our  affiliates.  If you do not want us to  share your Personal Data with our  affiliated companies for their  marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such  sharing by contacting us at   NBCUniPrivacy@nbcuni.com  (see “Your Choices” below).</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure to Third Parties:</strong> NBCUniversal, like  many businesses,  sometimes hires other companies to perform certain  business-related functions  on our behalf such as hosting specific  portions of the Site, maintaining  databases, administering contests,  providing wireless services, mailing  information and processing  payments.  When we employ a third party to  perform these functions,  that third party will only be provided with the  particular Personal  Data it needs to perform its function, and is required to  protect the  Personal Data.  For third-party sponsored sweepstakes,  contests or  promotions, we may request Personal Data from you that may be  shared  with the sponsor upon request.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure to Others:</strong> In addition, we may disclose   Personal Data without providing you with a choice under the following  limited circumstances  to:  (1)  protect the legal rights, privacy or  safety of NBCUniversal  or its subsidiaries, affiliates or its or   their employees, agents and contractors; (2)  protect the safety and   security of visitors to our web sites or other properties; (3)  protect   against fraud or other illegal activity or for risk management  purposes; (4)  respond to inquiries or requests from public authorities;  (5) permit us to  pursue available remedies or limit the damages that  we may sustain; (6) enforce  our Terms of Service; or (7)  comply with  the law or legal process.</p>
<p>If NBCUniversal  sells all or part of this Site or makes a  sale or transfer of assets or is  otherwise involved in a merger or  business transfer, we may, in our sole  discretion, transfer, sell or  assign your Personal Data to a third party as  part of or in connection  with that transaction.  Upon such transfer, the  Privacy Policy of the  acquiring entity may govern the further use of your  Personal Data.</p>
<p><a name="thirdpartyadvertising"></a><strong>5. Third-Party Advertising and Links to  Other Sites:</strong><br>
This Site may include third-party advertising.  These third  parties’  websites and advertisers, or the Internet advertising  companies that work on  their behalf, may use technology to send (or  “serve”) the advertisements that  appear on our Site directly to your  browser.  They automatically receive  your IP address when this  happens.  They may also use cookies, Javascript,  Pixel Tags and other  technologies to deliver advertisements, collect  information about the  effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect  anonymous  information about your visits to the Site, such as the number of  times  you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other Personal   Data).  For more information about these specialized cookies and other   technologies, and how to “opt out” of information collection by these   companies, we suggest you visit <a href="http://doubleclick.net/privacy_policy" target="_blank">http://doubleclick.net/privacy_policy</a> or  <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.</a></p>
<p>Please note that this Site contains links to other sites that  will not follow  the same Privacy Policy as our Site.  For instance,  clicking on an  advertisement or on links or other elements on the Site  may take you to an  entirely different site.  Links to other sites may  use our Site logo or  style as a result of a co-branding agreement.   These sites may send their  own cookies to you and may collect data and  make use of that data in ways that  this Site would not.  Once you’ve  left this Site, this Privacy Policy will  no longer apply to Personal  Data or any other data collected from or provided  by you.  You should  check the applicable privacy policy to determine how  that site will  handle such data.</p>
<p><a name="yourchoices"></a> <strong>6. Your Choices:</strong><br>
You can use the Site and certain Other Services without  providing any Personal  Data, but if you decline to provide Personal  Data, you may not be able to use  certain services or features.  If you  have previously provided Personal  Data to the Site and have subscribed  to one or more email newsletters or are  receiving emails or other  communications from the Site and you do not want to  receive such  emails, please discontinue your subscriptions by selecting the   “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any message, or contacting us at:   NBCUniPrivacy@nbcuni.com.   If  you ask that we stop using your Personal Data,  we will honor that request.   However we will retain records of your  Personal Data as needed in order to  comply with applicable federal,  state, or local law.</p>
<p><a name="accessandcorrection"></a> <strong>7. Access and Correction:</strong><br>
If you would like to review, correct or change the Personal  Data that you have  previously provided us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:NBCUniPrivacy@nbcuni.com">NBCUniPrivacy@nbcuni.com</a>.  We will take reasonable steps to update or correct Personal Data in our  possession.</p>
