<p><strong>13</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS&nbsp;<a class="anchor" id="links_to_other_online_services" name="links_to_other_online_services"></a></strong></p>
<p>Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third parties to which our online service has disclosed certain personal information (as defined by California law) during the preceding year for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. &nbsp;If you are a California resident and want such a list, please contact us at Chief Privacy Officer, NBCUniversal Legal Department, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112, US. For all requests, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. &nbsp;In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. &nbsp;You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. &nbsp;Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, email, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do Not Track</strong></em></p>
<p>California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how NBCUniversal responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. NBCUniversal does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>
