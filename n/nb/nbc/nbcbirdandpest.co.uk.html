<h2>4. How do we use the personal information that we gather from you?</h2>
<p>Our main aim in gathering your personal information is to understand your needs and provide you with a better and customised service.</p>
<p>We will process all the personal information we collect and hold on you fairly and in accordance with applicable law. As further explained in this privacy policy we will ensure the quality and security of your personal information; and we will fully respect your rights interests and fundamental freedoms with regard to your personal information.</p>

<ol>
<li>To improve our products and services or otherwise fulfil our contractual obligations towards you our customers, our prospective franchisees and our business partners within the NBC Network (as defined below in clause 5) as may exist from time to time; and/or</li>
<li>to serve our legitimate business interests such as administration including internal record keeping, credit assessment marketing, prospective franchisee vetting or to comply with legal requirements; and/or</li>
<li>in order that our representatives may by telephone or ordinary mail proactively follow up your enquires submitted to our Site about our products and services as part of our customer care procedures and/or reply to your e-mailed or otherwise voluntarily submitted questions enquiries and requirements that you may have; and/or</li>

<ol>
<li>1. by e-mail or other electronic communication with your prior consent (eg, by ‘opting in’ via tick or otherwise); or</li>
<li>2. by ordinary post or other non-electronic communication unless you (on registration/submission of details or subsequently) ‘opt out’ via e-mail or by unticking an on-line tick box or by registering with the appropriate Preference Service</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We may also use aggregate personal information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring Site usage in order to help us develop the Site and our service and may provide such aggregate and anonymised personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>If you inform us that you no longer wish us to contact you for any one or all of the reasons stated above in this clause 4(a) to (d) inclusive then we will cease contacting you although you acknowledge that this may prevent us from providing information about our products and/or services to you or inhibit the quality of service provided to you.</p>
<p>If we record or monitor telephone calls to and from any customers for staff training and quality control purposes we will first inform you that such recording and monitoring is taking place.</p>
<p>If at some time in the future we wish to use your personal information in ways other than those set out in this privacy policy and requiring your prior consent then we will notify you about this and seek your permission to do so.</p>
<h3>5. Sharing of personal information</h3>
<p>We may share personal information within the NBC network; by this expression, we mean NBC including together with its/their officers, employees, agents, distributors, consultants contractors (including data processing agencies (“processors”)), suppliers and certain selected third party organisations and NBC Bird and Pest Solutions (Franchising) Limited licensees (“<strong>NBC Network</strong>“). The NBC Network will process your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and all privacy and communications legislation.</p>
<p>We will not share with or sell lease or otherwise distribute your personal information to any third party organisations outside of the NBC Network without first obtaining your permission to do so. In particular, we will not release your personal information to our authorised direct marketing agents without first obtaining your prior consent.</p>
<p>We currently do not envisage transferring your personal information outside of the EEA. However, providing that we do so lawfully and for the sole purpose of fulfilling our contractual obligations to you you agree to our transferring personal information about you to any member or members of the NBC Network outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). You acknowledge that some countries where other facilities or companies or third party organisations are situated may have no data protection legislation or laws which are less rigorous than the legislation introduced by the member states of the European Union and the EEA. Accordingly, in the event that we need to transfer your personal information to any member or members of the NBC Network outside of the EEA for the sole purpose of fulfilling our contractual obligations with you you acknowledge and agree that we will use reasonable efforts to procure (but cannot guarantee) that such facilities companies or third party organisations give binding contractual undertakings in order to ensure the same level of protection for the processing carried out in these countries as within the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>Of course if we need your further specific and express consent to do this, we will obtain it before transferring any personal information.</p>
<p>In all cases, any use of your personal information by the NBC Network which has been instigated by us will comply with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that we reserve the right to use or disclose any personal information as needed to satisfy any law regulation or otherwise or legal request to protect and defend the integrity of the Site (including to enforce our <a href="http://www.nbcbirdandpest.co.uk/terms-of-use/" target="_self">Website Terms of Use</a> or this privacy policy) and you agree to fulfil our requests and/or to cooperate in any law enforcement or regulatory investigation.</p>
<p>Save for that stated above we do not transfer share or disclose personal information we have collected from you in connection with our on or off-line activities to third parties outside the NBC Network.</p>
<p>If in the future a third party organisation acquires us or substantially all of our assets including without limitation our database(s) (whether by merger, acquisition, reorganisation or otherwise) you acknowledge and agree that your information including personal information may well be one of the transferred assets.</p>
<h3>6. Protection of your personal information</h3>
<p>The internet is not a secure medium and we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of your personal information as set out below. We will however use all reasonable efforts to protect the information you provide to us.</p>
<p>We will only provide access to personal information on you to those members of the NBC Network who we consider need such access in order to carry out our contractual obligations to you. We have taken appropriate steps to ensure the security of personal information whether it is stored in computer systems paper files or other storage media. Access to your information is restricted in our offices. Only members of the NBC Network who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Further our Site and associated databases are protected by certified firewalls in order to protect your personal information from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing. The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. The Site uses the latest technology with full backups. Password protection is provided for all registered users of this Site. All outgoing and incoming email is scanned for viruses.</p>
