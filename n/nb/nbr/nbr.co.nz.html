Policy</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">By using this site, you agree to
the Privacy Policy of National Business Review. If you do not agree to
the Policy, please do not use this site. National Business Review examines
its privacy policy periodically and reserves the right, at its discretion,
to modify or remove portions of this policy at any time. This page should
be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. If you
want to communicate with us about our policy, please write to us at News
Liberty Press Group. Level 26 BNZ Tower, 125 Queen St, Auckland NZ, PO
Box 1881, Auckland 1015, or email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@nbr.co.nz">privacy@nbr.co.nz</a>.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">NBR, which operates the Internet
site located at <a href="http://www.nbr.co.nz" target="_blank">www.nbr.co.nz</a>
recognises the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable
information collected about visitors to our sites. As a general policy,
no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or email
address, is automatically collected from visitors to our sites. Personally
identifiable information about visitors to our sites is collected only
when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. We may collect certain non-personal
information to optimise our Web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity
of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP
address and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may
use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but
not limited to improving the content of our sites.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">In those instances when we do collect
personally identifiable information, the following policies apply:</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Notice</font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">NBR will notify you when we are collecting
personally identifiable information about you and how we intend to use
it. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you
with information or a product you requested, in connection with contest
entry forms or for billing purposes, or in connection with community postings
such as chat and bulletin boards.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Sometimes NBR engages in activities
with business partners and sponsors with whom personal information is jointly
collected or shared. We will try to make it clear at the time of collection
who is asking for and/or sharing your information. In situations where
your information will be shared, it is recommended that you also review
the privacy policy of our business partner or sponsor.</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Use and Security</font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Personally identifiable information
that visitors submit to our sites is used only for the purpose for which
it is submitted unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or
at the time of collection. Such other uses may include sending you information
or materials we think you will find interesting, or sharing the information
with NBR's advertisers and reputable business partners. However, at the
time of collection, you will have the option of instructing us not to send
you additional information or share your personal information with third
parties. NBR</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">not responsible for the privacy
policies or practices of our business partners.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">National Business Review may use
reputable third parties to manage activities available on our sites including,
but not limited to, sweepstakes, contests, statistical analysis, or chats.
These parties may have access to personally identifiable information submitted
by visitors who participate in those activities. Similarly, we may contract
with third parties to handle the fulfilment of subscriptions or requests
for information you submit to our sites, such as sending you a newsletter.
In most instances, National Business Review instructs these third parties
to use personally identifiable information only for the specific purpose
for which it is collected, and not to sell, market or transfer such information
to other entities. If National Business Review obtains personal information
that has been collected from you by a third party, including our business
partners, this Privacy Policy nonetheless governsNBR's use of that information.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Please remember that any information
posted as a reader response (e.g., letter to the editor)</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">becomes public information. You
should use caution when sharing information as any of it can be collected
and used by people you may not know. Users under the age of 18 should be
particularly careful not to divulge any personal information. While National
Business Review strives to protect and respect your privacy, we can not
guarantee the security of any information you disclose in such a communication
and you do so at your own risk.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">National Business Review may use
personally identifiable information in aggregate form to make our sites
better and more responsive to the needs of our visitors. This statistical
compilation and analysis of information may also be used by National Business
Review or provided to others, in aggregate, for marketing, advertising
or research purposes.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">If at any time after submitting your
personal information to our sites you would no longer like to receive information
from us, simply follow the "unsubscribe" directions at the end of any email
communication you receive.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Personal information may be disclosed
in special situations where National Business Review has reason to believe
that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against
anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally)
with NBR's rights, property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed
by such activities. Also, National Business Review may reveal information
when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">National Business Review maintains
appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of
personally identifiable information submitted to our sites, and periodically
reviews and updates its security measures in light of current technologies.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
to be totally secure. Although National Business Review strives to protect
your personal information, we can not ensure or warranty the security of
any information you may transmit to us or from our online products and
services. This is done so at your own risk. Once we do receive your transmission,
however, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
Should credit card information be required as part of any interaction,
industry standard encryption is used.</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Cookies</font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Cookies are data that a Web site
transfers to an individual's hard-drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies,
which are an industry standard used by most Web sites, including those
operated by NBR, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a
site. They allow us to track usage patterns and to compile data that can
help us improve our content and target advertising. National Business Review
does not save passwords or credit card information within Cookies, nor
are our Cookies programs of the sort that can cause damage to a user's
systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the
use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows
you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. But you should note that Cookies
may be necessary to provide you with features such as merchandise transactions

Sites</font></font></b>

relationships with reputable business partners that allow visitors to our
Internet sites to link directly to sites operated by these partners. These
sites may collect personal information from you that may be shared with
NBR. As noted above, this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information
we obtain in this manner.</font></font>

its advertisers and business partners carefully. However, National Business
Review is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated

also be linked to Web sites operated by companies affiliated with NBR.
Visitors to those sites should refer to their separate privacy policies
and practices.</font></font>
