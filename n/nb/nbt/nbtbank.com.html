      <h2>Protecting Your Customer Information </h2>
      

      <ul>
        <li><em>Don’t give personal information, such as account numbers or Social Security numbers, over the telephone, through the mail or over the Internet, unless you know with whom you are dealing. </em></li>
        <li><em> Store personal information in a safe place and tear up or shred old credit card receipts, ATM receipts and unused credit card offers before throwing them away. </em></li>
        <li><em> Pay attention to billing cycles and statements. Contact the bank if you do not receive a regular monthly bill or statement. It may mean that the document has been diverted by identity theft. </em></li>
        <li><em>Check all account statements carefully to ensure all charges, checks or withdrawals were authorized.</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p> If you suspect that someone has had unauthorized access to your account with us or to your personal identifying information, such as your Social Security number or credit card information, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em> Contact the fraud department of each of the three major credit bureaus to report the identity theft and request that the credit bureaus place a fraud alert and a victim’s statement in your file. The fraud departments of the three national credit bureaus can be contacted as follows:<br>
          <br>
          TransUnion — 1-800-680-7289 <br>

          <br>
          Experian — 1-888-397-3742 <br>
          <br>
        You may request a free copy of your credit report. Credit bureaus must provide a free copy of your report if you have reason to believe that you have been a victim of identity theft and you submit your request in writing. </em></li>
        <li><em> Contact the bank or other creditor where you have an account. </em></li>
        <li><em> File a report with your local police department. </em></li>
        <li><em>Contact the Federal Trade Commission’s Identity Theft Hotline toll-free at 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). The FTC’s toll-free teletypewriter (TTY) number is 1-866-653-4261. </em></li>
