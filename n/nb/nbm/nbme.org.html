          </ul>
<p>In  general, you are required to respond to most of the questions on the application  forms.&nbsp; You, however, are not required to  provide information regarding your ethnicity or first language.&nbsp; Providing this information is optional and  does not affect the outcome of your application.&nbsp; NBME uses information about the ethnicity and  first language of its applicants for research purposes, and it is kept  confidential.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>By  providing your personal information online, you consent to allow NBME to use  that information in accordance with this Policy.&nbsp; This information is used for identification  purposes and as stated below in Section 6. </p>
<h2><strong>3. Security</strong></h2>
<p>  The  security of your personal information is of the utmost concern to NBME.&nbsp; We have administrative, technical and  physical measures in place to protect the security of your personal information.&nbsp; To protect your privacy, the NBME utilizes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to prevent third parties from seeing your personal and sensitive information (such as credit card number, social security number, or National ID number) during data transmission.  </p>
<p>In order to access some services, you are required to enter a username and password to confirm your identity.  For example, to access your personal information for NBME Licensing Examination Services, you must first confirm your identity by entering your USMLE identification number and a password.  This authentication page is secured by SSL technology.</p>
<p>When you prepare to pay for services, you will enter our secure payment web page and will have a limited amount of time to enter the required information.  NBME uses a third-party vendor to process your online payments.  NBME uses digital certificates through VeriSign.  As a VeriSign Secure Site, visitors can verify the site's authenticity and communicate with NBME securely using 128 bit encryption that protects confidential information. </p>
<p>Please note that pages other than the authentication page and payment page are not secured by SSL or other encryption programs. </p>
<p>Unfortunately,  no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure.&nbsp; As a result, while we strive to protect your personal  information, we cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any  information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; In the event there is a breach of the  security measures used by NBME, NBME will take reasonable and appropriate  actions to minimize the damage resulting from the security breach.&nbsp; However, NBME cannot guarantee that  unauthorized individuals will not obtain access to NBME systems through illegal  measures, despite our security measures.</p>
<p>If,  for any reason, you should choose not to provide your personal information  online, you may request a paper version of the application or document request  form by calling 215-590-9700 or by email to <a href="mailto:%77%65%62%6D%61%69%6C%40%6E%62%6D%65%2E%6F%72%67">webmail@nbme.org</a>.

<p>  All  credit card transactions are processed through a vendor via SSL.&nbsp; NBME submits the requisite information to the  appropriate clearinghouse to verify and validate the credit card.&nbsp; NBME does not disclose credit card  information for any other purpose.</p>
<h2><strong>6.&nbsp; Use of Personal Information Collected</strong> </h2>

<h2><strong>6.&nbsp; Disclosure of Personal Information to Third  Parties</strong> </h2>
<p>  We disclose your personal information to certain third parties to provide the products and services you have requested online.  To support these services, we send a portion of your personal information, such as name and USMLE ID, to them using secured protocols and encryption.  They have access to the minimal information needed to perform their functions, but otherwise will not use the information for other purposes.  For example, when you apply for a USMLE examination, we will provide certain registration information to companies that schedule and administer the test.  </p>
<p>NBME uses a third-party vendor to process your online payment transactions.  To process these transactions, your payment information must be disclosed to this third party. See Section 3 above. </p>
<p>The USMLE is sponsored jointly by the NBME and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB).  To ensure an efficient and accurate examination process for applicants, portions of the personal information you provide to us during the registration process are retained in a database shared by the NBME and FSMB for the purposes of exam registration and scheduling.  Additionally, this information, as well as performance data from the examination, is used by these organizations for research and statistical purposes, although only in the aggregate. &nbsp; </p>
<p>NBME also shares certain user information, such as USMLE ID, Social Security number, name, Medical School name and graduation date, date of birth, gender and score information with the Association of American Medical Colleges (the "AAMC").  This organization uses the data that we provide for research purposes only. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
<p>Other than as noted in this Policy, or as NBME shall notify user in the future, NBME does not to sell, rent, share, offer, or otherwise disclose any personal information, such as names, e-mail addresses, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, credit card information, and other personal information that you voluntarily provide to NBME, to any organization or individual without a legitimate interest (collectively "Third Parties"), except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of NBME.</p>
