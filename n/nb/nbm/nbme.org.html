<h2>1. General Users</h2>
                         <p>
						 
						 NBME does not collect any personal information from users browsing its website.  Users to the public area of the  <a href="http://www.nbme.org/">www.NBME.org</a>  website may browse anonymously.  NBME’s web servers may track the Internet protocol (IP) addresses of visitors to the Site to measure number of visits to the website.

To access certain portions of the Site, you may have to submit a user ID and password.

                         <h2>2. Collection of and Consent to Use Personal  Information from Site Users</h2>
                         <p>You may provide personal information to us in the process of completing various forms for the United States Medical Licensing Examination® (USMLE®) and/or NBME programs and services for medical schools, students and graduates of medical schools.  Personal information may include, but is not limited to: </p>
                         <ul>
                           <li>Name</li>
                           <li>Date of birth</li>
                           <li>Email address</li>
                           <li>Billing and Mailing address</li>
                           <li>Telephone number</li>
                           <li>Credit card and billing information</li>
                           <li>Social security or national identification number</li>
                           <li>Citizenship</li>
                           <li>Gender</li>
                           <li>Medical school history&nbsp; (including Medical School name,  country, professional degree, date degree conferred/expected) </li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>In general, you are required to respond to most of the questions on the application forms. However, you are not required to provide information regarding your ethnicity or first language. Providing this information is optional and does not affect the outcome of your application. NBME uses information about the ethnicity and first language of its applicants for research purposes, and it is kept confidential.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
                         By providing your personal information online, you consent to allow NBME to use that information in accordance with this Policy. This information is used for identification purposes and as stated below in Section 6.<br>
                           <br>
                           In addition to the personally identifiable information described above, we also collect aggregate information from many users about use of the NBME Services Portal (NSP), such as number of visits and pages visited on the NSP, and the overall duration of time spent on the NSP. The information we collect depends in large part upon the needs of your account and what services and features you use on the NSP. We do not disclose this information to third parties.</p>
                         <h2>3. Security</h2>
                         <p>The security of your personal information is of the utmost concern to NBME. We have administrative, technical and physical measures in place to protect the security of your personal information. To protect your privacy, the NBME utilizes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to prevent third parties from seeing your personal and sensitive information (such as credit card number, social security number, or national ID number) during data transmission. <br>
                           <br>
                           In order to access some services, you are required to enter a username and password to confirm your identity. For example, to access your personal information for NBME Licensing Examination Services, you must first confirm your identity by entering your USMLE identification number and a password. This authentication page is secured by SSL technology.<br>
                           <br>
                           When you prepare to pay for services, you will enter our secure payment web page and will have a limited amount of time to enter the required information. NBME uses a third-party vendor to process your online payments. NBME uses digital certificates through VeriSign. As a VeriSign secure site, visitors can verify the site's authenticity and communicate with NBME securely using 128-bit encryption that protects confidential information.<br>
                           <br>
                           Please note that pages other than the authentication page and payment page may not be secured by SSL or other encryption programs.<br>
                           <br>
                           Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In the event there is a breach of the security measures used by NBME, NBME will take reasonable and appropriate actions to minimize the damage resulting from the security breach. However, NBME cannot guarantee that unauthorized individuals will not obtain access to NBME systems through illegal measures, despite our security measures.<br>
                           <br>
                           If, for any reason, you should choose not to provide your personal information online, you may request a paper version of the application or document request form by calling 215-590-9700 or by email to &nbsp;<a href="mailto:%77%65%62%6D%61%69%6C%40%6E%62%6D%65%2E%6F%72%67">webmail@nbme.org </a>.

                         <p>We may distribute the personally identifiable information that you submit to us, both internally within our organization and to our agents and affiliates as necessary for purposes related to our services.

                           <br>
                           We disclose your personal information to certain third parties to provide the products and services you have requested online. To support these services, we send a portion of your personal information, such as name and USMLE ID, to them using secured protocols and encryption. They have access to the minimal information needed to perform their functions but otherwise will not use the information for other purposes. For example, when you apply for a USMLE examination, we will provide certain registration information to companies that schedule and administer the test.<br>
                           <br>
                           NBME uses a  third-party vendor to process your online payment transactions. To process  these transactions, your payment information must be disclosed to this third  party. See Section 3 aboveNBME uses a third-party vendor to process your online payment transactions. To process these transactions, your payment information must be disclosed to this third party. See Section 3 above.<br>
                           <br>
                           The USMLE is sponsored jointly by the NBME and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB). To ensure an efficient and accurate examination process for applicants, portions of the personal information you provide to us during the registration process are retained in a database shared by the NBME and FSMB for the purposes of exam registration and scheduling. Additionally, this information, as well as performance data from the examination, is used by these organizations for research and statistical purposes, although only in the aggregate.<br>
                           <br>
                           NBME also shares certain user information, such as USMLE ID, social security number, name, medical school name and graduation date, date of birth, gender and score information with the Association of American Medical Colleges (the  "AAMC"). This organization uses the data that we provide for research purposes only. <br>
                           <br>
                           NBME also may provide personally identifiable information to certain third parties that have entered into contracts with us to provide certain services. We may also use this information to help us manage programs and services that may be of interest to you.<br>
                           <br>
                           Please also note that all of your activities on the NBME Services Portal are traceable through your single sign-on (SSO) account.

                           Other than as noted in this Policy, or as NBME shall notify users in the future, NBME does not sell, rent, share, offer, or otherwise disclose any personal information, such as names, e-mail addresses, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, and other personal information that you voluntarily provide to NBME, to any organization or individual without a legitimate interest (collectively "Third Parties"), except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of NBME.<br>
                           <br>
