  <div class="content">
    <p>NBAHoopTroop.com is a web Site operated by Cartoon Interactive Group, Inc. ("Cartoon<br>
Network") and its affiliates pursuant to an agreement with NBA Media Ventures,<br>
LLC ("NBAMV"), NBA TV, LLC ("NBATV") and NBA Properties, Inc. ("NBAP")<br>
(NBAMV, NBATV and NBAP collectively referred to as the "NBA Entities") (NBA<br>
Entities and Cartoon Network collectively are referred to herein as "we", "our" or "us").</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting NBA Hoop Troop. Your privacy is important to us. To better<br>
protect your privacy, and to help ensure a rewarding online experience for all visitors,<br>
we provide this Privacy Statement summarizing our online information practices and<br>
explaining the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and<br>
used. This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected on the NBA Hoop<br>
Troop web sites where this Privacy Statement is posted (the "Sites") and does not apply<br>
to any other information collected by Cartoon Network and its affiliated entities on any<br>
other site or through any other means.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing fun, safe and secure Sites for people of all ages. We<br>
are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected online and to helping<br>
our visitors learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring<br>
the Internet. Because many visitors to the Sites are children, we make efforts to ensure<br>
that children access only the content that is appropriate for them. In addition, we<br>
employ special measures to help children protect their privacy while online. We do<br>
not ask children to disclose more information than is necessary for them to participate<br>
in a particular activity, and we take steps to prevent children from posting personal<br>
information.</p>
<p>As we continue to offer our visitors new and different types of content and services, we<br>
may modify our practices from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>I. The Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>At NBA Hoop Troop, we do not collect personally identifiable information on our Site<br>
unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us, including when you participate in any<br>
activities on our Site like sweepstakes, contests, games, and promotional offers. We do<br>
not ask children to disclose more information than is necessary for them to participate<br>
in a particular activity, and we take steps to prevent children from disclosing more<br>
information than is necessary to participate in activities on the site. For some activities,<br>
such as online polls or surveys, we may ask visitors to provide information that is not<br>
personally identifiable. This might include first name only, city or state of residence,<br>
age, gender, or a favorite basketball player. For some other activities, such as entering<br>
sweepstakes, we may ask visitors to provide a first name and e-mail address. For other<br>
activities, such as sending an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend, we may also ask<br>
for personal information about other people. This is usually limited to a first name and<br>
e-mail address. E-mail addresses collected to send an electronic postcard or e-mail to a<br>
friend are deleted immediately when the requested postcard or e-mail is transmitted.</p>
<p>If a child under age thirteen participates in any ongoing activity that requires the<br>
collection, retention, and use of personal information, we will also ask for a parent's e-<br>
mail address so that we can notify the parent that we have received personal information<br>
from their child. We do not knowingly collect names and e-mail addresses from children under age thirteen for these types of activities without notifying the parent via e-mail and giving the parent the option to remove their child's e-mail address from the applicable<br>
database for that activity. For specific one-time requests we receive from visitors, e-mail<br>
addresses are collected and used only in connection with the specific one-time request.<br>
For example, for sweepstakes and contests, e-mail addresses are collected for the purpose<br>
of entering the online sweepstakes or contest on a one-time basis and are used to notify<br>
winners of the sweepstakes or contest once by e-mail. Winners will be required to return<br>
a completed prize acceptance form contained in the notification e-mail by facsimile or<br>
U.S. mail within a designated time period (along with the signature of a parent or legal<br>
guardian for all minors).</p>
<p>In connection with registration for certain interactive online games or features on the<br>
Sites, we may ask users to provide certain information that is not personally identifiable<br>
. For registration of children under the age of thirteen, we may ask for the child's e-<br>
mail address, which will not be stored in a retrievable form but instead using a "hash" or<br>
unique code generated from the e-mail address that will allow us on a one-time basis, for<br>
example, to respond to an inquiry from the child regarding a lost user name or password.<br>
We also may ask for a parental email address for children under age 13 who register<br>
in order to provide notice to the parent that his or her child would like to participate in<br>
registration for certain interactive features. For individuals age thirteen and over, we may<br>
collect and store an e-mail address to use in the case of forgotten passwords.</p>
<p>When visitors come to our Site, we also may collect some non-personally identifiable<br>
information such as the current Internet protocol address, the type of mobile or handheld<br>
device used to view the Site (e.g. iPhone, Blackberry), the type of computer operating<br>
system you are using (e.g., Microsoft Windows, Mac OS), the type of browser you are<br>
using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the domain name of the Internet service provider<br>
(e.g., America Online, Earthlink), your activities while visiting our Site, your activities<br>
while playing games or utilizing services on our Site (e.g., which of our Web pages you<br>
viewed or which games you played), and the advertisements you have been shown.</p>
<p><strong>II. How We Use the Information</strong></p>
<p>We use visitors' personal information collected in connection with child-directed<br>
activities for internal purposes only, such as enabling visitors to enter our online contests<br>
or sweepstakes or for the purposes for which you provided the information.</p>
<p>We use parents' e-mail addresses to notify them when we have received personal<br>
information such as e-mail addresses from their children and to give parents the option to<br>
remove their child's name from our lists. We use information we collect about others only<br>
to enable visitors to our Site to communicate with those other people, for example, by<br>
sending them electronic greeting cards as requested.</p>
<p>We only keep any personal information we obtain through a contest or sweepstakes until<br>
we have successfully selected a winner(s), awarded the prize(s), and administered the<br>
contest or sweepstakes.</p>
<p>We never sell, rent, or otherwise share our visitors' personal information with third<br>
parties without appropriate consent. Sometimes, we use agents or contractors to provide<br>
services to our visitors, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes, sending prizes to<br>
winners or providing customer service related to activities on the Site. In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for<br>
the specific services they are performing consistent with this policy. We sometimes use<br>
non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content<br>
of our Site, and to improve our visitors' experience on the Site.</p>
<p>We also may aggregate, use and share this information with third parties to analyze Site<br>
usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for<br>
example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may use and disclose<br>
such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we<br>
believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,<br>
suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any<br>
person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies<br>
governing our Site and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by law or<br>
consistent with legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable<br>
information about you if we or one of our business units are acquired by, sold to, or<br>
merged with another entity.</p>
<p>We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are materially<br>
different from the ones described above without also providing parental notification of<br>
such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses.</p>
<p><strong>III. Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>To enhance your online experience, our Sites use a software technology called "cookies"<br>
or similar technologies. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors' computer browsers<br>
to store their preferences. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information.<br>
Although cookies could enable us to relate a visitor's use of our Sites and the Internet<br>
to personal information that the visitor has provided, such as an e-mail address, we do<br>
not use cookies in connection with personal information with one exception: for some<br>
activities, we use session cookies to ensure that visitors under the age of 13 provide a<br>
parental email address to assist with our compliance with the Children's Online Privacy<br>
Protection Act. We do use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how<br>
often they visit various sections of our Sites and to improve or customize the content,<br>
offerings and/or advertisements on our Sites. For example, we may use cookies to<br>
personalize your experience at our Sites (e.g., to recognize you by your user name when<br>
you return to a Site).</p>
<p>We, our third party service providers and/or our partners also may use cookies to manage<br>
and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through<br>
the Sites. This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant<br>
advertising. For more information regarding third-party ad servers, see " Collection of<br>
Information by Third-Party Sites," below.</p>
<p>"Web beacons" or clear .gifs or similar technologies are small pieces of code placed on a<br>
web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page.<br>
For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to<br>
deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We, our third party service<br>
providers and/or our partners may use web beacons on our Site from time to time for this<br>
and other purposes.You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar<br>
technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies,<br>
block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser,<br>
or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may<br>
prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at our Sites. Please consult the "Help"<br>
section of your browser for more information.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers and Sponsors</strong></p>
<p>Our Site contains links to other Web sites, including those of sponsors and advertisers,<br>
whose information practices may be different from ours. Sometimes these third party<br>
Web sites might conduct contests or sweepstakes that are promoted on our Site. Visitors<br>
should consult those other third party Web sites' privacy notices, since those Web sites<br>
are not covered by our Privacy Statement and may follow different procedures.</p>
<p>Additionally, we and our advertisers may use third parties to serve or present the ads<br>
that appear on our site and to conduct research about the advertisements. These third<br>
parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers and/<br>
or partners may also place cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to<br>
help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements'<br>
effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own<br>
privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Statement. For more information about<br>
third-party ad servers and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third<br>
party ad servers generally, please see <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" title="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a> .</p>
<p><strong>V. International Transfer</strong></p>
<p>NBA Entities and Cartoon Network are worldwide brands and operate globally so it<br>
may be necessary to transfer any information provided to these Sites internationally. In<br>
particular, the information provided will likely be transferred to and processed in the<br>
United States where many of our central databases operate. The data protection and<br>
other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as comprehensive as<br>
those in your country. Please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your<br>
privacy is protected. By using this Site, you consent to your information being collected<br>
and used as set forth in this Privacy Statement.</p>
