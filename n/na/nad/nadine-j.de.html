			<h2>Data Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Our website  may be used without entering personal information. Different rules may apply to  certain services on our site, however, and are explained separately below. We  collect personal information from you (e.g. name, address, email address,  telephone number, etc.) in accordance with the provisions of German data  protection statutes. Information is considered personal if it can be associated  exclusively to a specific natural person. The legal framework for data  protection may be found in the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the  Telemedia Act (TMG). The provisions below serve to provide information as to  the manner, extent and purpose for collecting, using and processing personal  information by the provider.</p>
            <p> <strong>[Provider’s  name and address]</strong>
            <strong>[Provider’s  telephone number]</strong>
            <strong>[Provider’s  email address]</strong></p>
            <p>    Please be  aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to security risks and,  therefore, complete protection against third-party access to transferred data  cannot be ensured.</p>
            
            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <p>Our website  makes use of so-called cookies in order to recognize repeat use of our website  by the same user/internet connection subscriber. Cookies are small text files  that your internet browser downloads and stores on your computer. They are used  to improve our website and services. In most cases these are so-called "session  cookies" that are deleted once you leave our website.</p>
            <p> To an extent, however, these cookies also pass along information used to automatically  recognize you. Recognition occurs through an IP address saved to the cookies. The  information thereby obtained is used to improve our services and to expedite  your access to the website.</p>
            <p> You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your  browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you  may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.</p>
            
            <h4>GOOGLE WEB Fonts</h4>
            <p>This site uses so-called web fonts, provided by Google, for the uniform representation of fonts. When you call up a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly. To do this, the browser you use must connect to Google's servers. As a result, Google learns that our website has been accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web Fonts is in the interest of a consistent and attractive presentation of our online services. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. If your browser does not support web fonts, a default font will be used by your computer. For more information about Google Web Fonts, see https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in Google's privacy policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.</p>            

            <h4>Server Data</h4>
            <p>For  technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser  transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files), is  collected:
            
                        - type and version of the browser you use
                        - operating system
                        - websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL)
                        - websites that you visit
                        - date and time of your visit
                        - your Internet Protocol (IP) address.
            
                        This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information you may  have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it to any particular  person. The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our  website and services.</p>
