<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement, please contact
<a href="mailto:service@namescout.com"><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="-1">service@namescout.com</font></a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Getting To Know Our Customers</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Namescout.com is in the business of putting people in touch with other people. That
requires more than simply offering innovative technical services. It also requires that we
understand you, our customer, and your needs. Indeed, we are a leading
domain name registrar because we have taken the time to get acquainted with each one of
our many customers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We get to know you primarily through the information you provide to us when signing up
for, or using, one or more of our services. The information you provide ranges from basic
contact information, to payment information, to the technical coordinates of your host
servers. The application for domain name registration services found at
<a href="http://www.namescout.com"><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="-1">http://www.namescout.com</font></a> is a representative illustration of the information we
request of you. All of the information we request from you when purchasing our services
is obligatory unless otherwise noted on the relevant form. When you purchase our
services, you agree to provide and maintain accurate, complete and updated information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After you've signed up for our services, we may be in communication with you about
your account, technical questions you may have about services provided by us, or any
other matter relating to those services. Those communications are essential to our
relationship with you and to our ability to provide you with quality services that are
responsive to your needs. At the same time, those communications give us helpful
insights about you, your preferences and the ways in which we might improve our
services. We therefore may maintain this information for future use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Additionally, for operational and quality assurance purposes, we take note of whether and
how you use the information and services that we provide, such as by recording site
traffic patterns and by maintaining log files of users' access to site files. Finally, in order
to provide our interactive services, we store your messages to or from other people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The information we receive from or about you is stored on systems designed to prevent
the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of that
information. We also encrypt your transmission of sensitive information to us (e.g., credit
card numbers, account passwords) in the interest of heightened privacy protection and
information integrity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As a domain name registrar, we compile and maintain a publicly accessible registration
database that includes basic information about each domain name registered with us,
including the names, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of individuals designated
as points of contact for a given domain name. Whether or not applicable domain name
registration fees have been paid is also publicly accessible. With the gradual continued
privatization of the Domain Name System, and consistent with the rules or policies
applicable to that system, or to comply with any changes in law or regulation, we may, if
appropriate, take steps to restrict the accessibility and amount of personally identifying
information available in the registration database.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Information Corrections Or Changes</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You have the ability to correct or change certain information in our records, such as your
address and contact information. The instructions for doing this can be found on our Web
site at <a href="http://www.namescout.com"><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="-1">http://www.namescout.com</font></a>. You may change this
information at any time and as often as necessary. If you need assistance or have
questions about correcting information, you can contact us via e-mail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>How We Put Information To Good Use</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We use information about you for purposes of monitoring and improving our internal
operations, as well as to ensure that we: (i) bill you properly, (ii) administer your account
in accordance with your agreements with us and (iii) properly perform the services you
have requested.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve our internal operations, as
well as to improve the experience of users in our network of sites. For example, we may
correlate Web site traffic information with data about individual users. We may also
break down overall usage statistics according to customers' domain names, browser
types, and MIME types by reading this information from the browser string (information
contained in every user's browser).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another example of our use of information to enhance the experience of users in our
network of sites is our reliance on cookie files. We use cookie files to make it easier for
users to access our site or services. A cookie file is a small data file that certain Web sites
write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such
as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal
information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read
data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to track
user traffic patterns (as described above) when you register for Namescout.com's
services. When you register, we may use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We
use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit
on our site. This type of temporary cookie lasts only for your current session on our web page and is not used
after your session expires.  We use it primarily to keep track of information during your session, such as what domain
you have select to register as you step through the various registration forms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the
warning message with each cookie. You may refuse cookies by turning them off in your
browser; however, some of our sites may require a cookie for access.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, we use the information we collect to direct important notices and information
affecting your account or services, as well as to provide general information that may be
of interest to you, including newsletters, surveys, contest and sweepstake announcements,
and information about our service or product offerings or the offerings of our business
affiliates. You may opt out of receiving information from us simply by notifying us of
your desire in accordance with the opt-out instructions contained in any information
message you receive from us. Note, however, that in order to fulfill our service
obligations to you, we must continue sending you notices and other important
information affecting your account or services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>With Whom We May Share Information</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you register or reserve a domain name through us, our registrar unit must disclose
information about your domain name, your contact details,  and the domains associated Internet Protocol ("IP") numbers to the appropriate
registry in order to make your chosen domain name a functional address on the Internet.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We may share certain information about you with those of our vendors who are
responsible for handling your account or performing other necessary services that you
require. Although we may share sensitive financial information (i.e., credit card numbers,
banking information), security information (e.g., account passwords) and personal
communications (e.g., personal e-mail messages or message board postings) with such
vendors where necessary and appropriate, we will not share such information with other
third parties, except in response to formal requests (e.g., subpoena or court order) made in
connection with litigation or arbitration proceedings directly relating to a domain name
registration or other services we provide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As noted above, our domain name registrar unit currently makes certain information
about you available to the general public via our domain name registration database look-
up and directory services. These services give users access to such data on a query-by-
query basis.  Qualified persons may also access such data on a bulk basis provided they
agree, among other things, not to use the data to enable or otherwise support the
transmission of mass unsolicited commercial advertising or solicitations via email; or (ii)
sell or redistribute the data to third parties.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Additionally, we may share the information stored on that database, as well as other
information that is not of a sensitive nature, with carefully selected business partners,
including those who offer services that complement those provided by us or which may
otherwise be of interest to you.  Please note, that consistent with the current rules and policies for the Domain Name System,
information about you must remain available in the publicly accessible registration
database.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Our Accountability To You</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By purchasing our services, you obtain the protections of, and consent to the data
processing practices described in, this Privacy Statement. When you purchase our
services, you also represent to us that you have provided notice to, and obtained consent
from, any third party individuals whose personal data you supply to us with regard to: (i)
the purposes for which such third party's personal data have been collected, (ii) the
intended recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data, (iii)
which of the third party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary, and
(iv) how the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the data held about them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to the privacy protections that we provide, our employees, agents and
business partners are independently responsible for ensuring compliance with this
Privacy Statement, as described below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Employee Accountability</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Only those Namescout.com employees that have a legitimate business purpose for
accessing and handling personal information obtained by us are given authorization to do
so. The unauthorized access or use of such information by a Namescout.com employee
is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Additionally, our information management systems are configured in such a way as to
block or inhibit employees from accessing information that they have no authority to
access.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The Accountability of Namescout.com's Agents and Business Partners</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our trusted vendors and business partners are responsible for processing or handling
some of the information that we receive. These vendors and business partners are not
authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those specified by us and are
required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you feel that Namescout.com, or any of our agents, representatives or employees, is
violating this Privacy Statement, please contact us via e-mail at
<a href="mailto:service@namescout.com"><font face="Arial,Verdana" size="-1">service@namescout.com</font></a>, by telephone at +1 (613) 768-5140, or by postal mail at:<br><br>
