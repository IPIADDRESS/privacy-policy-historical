NUSA does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers.&nbsp; To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within our corporate group globally who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with our privacy policy.</p> <p><strong>To protect the security and integrity of the Site and the business</strong>. &nbsp;As described above, we automatically collect certain information from you so that we can improve your user experience, and protect, maintain and improve the security and integrity of this Site and to enhance the operation or analyze interest in the areas of our Site.</p> <p><strong>Legal Proceedings</strong>. &nbsp;We reserve the right to disclose your personal information to third party companies, organizations and/or individuals for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including to credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, and for the purposes of litigation or to satisfy laws or regulations, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information. &nbsp;We may also disclose personal information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our contracts, policies and procedures. Finally we may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.&nbsp; Finally, we will share personal information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to respond to any subpoena or enforceable governmental request; to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of NUSA, our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control</strong>. &nbsp;If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the Site to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your personal information to the new owner. &nbsp;In such a case, unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree differently.</p> <p><strong>Corresponding with You</strong>. &nbsp;We may also use the personal information you provided to us in order to respond to your inquiries and other correspondences or user submissions. &nbsp;We may also use your information in communicating with you regarding important information regarding your personal information.</p> <p><strong>To Provide Services and Information</strong>. &nbsp;As described above, we collect personal information from you so that we can provide information that you request from us. &nbsp;We may use your personal information in order to fulfill your requests, for marketing purposes, and we may also send you information and materials, including about our products and services, and new offerings. &nbsp;We may provide your personal information to third party service providers that help us process orders, and fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us. &nbsp;We may use third parties to help host our Site, send out e-mail updates about the Site, provide marketing and advertising services for us, and remove repetitive information. &nbsp;These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service. &nbsp;In addition, we, or third party service providers on our behalf, may also collect aggregate information about Site users on an anonymous basis.&nbsp; To learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative websites (www.aboutads.info&nbsp;and www.networkadvertising.org).</p> <p><strong>HOW NUSA PROTECTS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p> <p>NUSA takes precautions—including administrative, technical, and physical measures—to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.&nbsp; Our web sites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required to make online purchases you must use an SSL-enabled browser in order to protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it’s transmitted over the Internet.
