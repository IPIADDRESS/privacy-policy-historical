<p>Your privacy is important to  NameSpace, Inc. (“NameSpace”, “we” or “us”). This Privacy Policy outlines the  principles and practices that apply to information collected from end-users,  whether directly or through network partners such as Internet Service  Providers.</p>
<p><strong>The NameSpace  Service:</strong> <br>
  NameSpace works with Internet Service Providers and other network partners to  provide relevant direct navigation events when a user enters into the address  bar a brand-based query that cannot be resolved by one of our partners.  NameSpace navigates users only when entered queries clearly contain or reflect  brand and trademark names belonging to our brand customers (merchants and  advertisers) and partners.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of  Personal Information:</strong> <br>
  NameSpace does not collect or capture any personally identifiable information.  We may collect anonymous information related to use of the service, which may  include origination IP address, queries, or the IP address to which a query is  directed. NameSpace takes reasonable and appropriate security measures to  protect against unauthorized access to, or disclosure of collected information.  In no event will NameSpace use or sell information which relates to a user’s  personally identifiable use of the Internet. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How NameSpace uses the information collected:</strong> <br>
  NameSpace uses collected information to assess and improve our existing  services, develop new services, diagnose technical problems, and allocate the  resources of our systems. </p>
<p><strong>To whom  NameSpace discloses information:</strong> <br>
  From time to time, NameSpace may disclose collected information: </p>
<ul>
  <li>To a user’s Internet Service Provider. </li>
  <li>To organizations that perform services for or on    behalf of NameSpace, which may include data processing, or to measure the use    of our services. </li>
  <li>To protect ourselves against liability or prevent    fraudulent activity; or where it is necessary to permit us to pursue    available remedies or limit any damages that NameSpace may sustain, to effect    a corporate transaction, in connection with the sale, merger, or other    corporate reorganization of our company, where the information is transferred    to the new controlling entity in the regular course of business.</li>
  <li>Where the information is public.</li>
  <li>To our insurers or to comply with a subpoena,    warrant or court (or similar) order.</li>
  <li>To a person who needs the information because of    an emergency that threatens the life, health, or security of an identifiable    person or group, or where necessary to collect monies owing to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Children:</strong><br>
  NameSpace  services are not designed or intended for use by children under 13, although  participating merchants on our site may offer children's products for purchase  by adults. If you are under 18, you should use NameSpace only with involvement  of a parent or guardian. Children under 13 may not submit any personally  identifiable information to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently  gathered any such information from a child under 13, we will take appropriate  steps to delete it.</p>
<p> <strong>Third Party  Advertising:</strong><br>
  We work with third parties, including advertising companies, who may use  cookies and clear gifs to collect non-personally identifiable information when  you visit our Web site and other sites or are offered the opportunity to  participate in an incentive. This information may be used to provide you with  better shopping or savings opportunities through advertisements on this and  other Web sites that you visit, or to conduct market research and website  analysis. Users who visit a the website of a brand customer of NameSpace may  receive cookies or gifs intended to help analyze their use of the merchant's  site in relation to their satisfaction and use of that site.</p>
<p><strong>Participating  Merchant Policies:</strong><br>
  Online merchants, survey  incentive vendors, and others who participate in NSG services are encouraged to  participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude  towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have direct control over the  policies or practices of participating merchants, survey incentive vendors, and  other third parties, we cannot be responsible for their actions. We recommend  that you always review the privacy policies of merchants and other third  parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction  with such parties.</p>
<strong>Protective Measures  for End-Users:</strong> <br>
NameSpace will not, at any time, request credit card information, Member ID,  login password, or national identification numbers. For more information about  the practice known as "phishing," and to learn how to protect  themselves in online transactions, users may want to visit the Federal Trade  Commission at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">http://www.ftc.gov/</a>. <br>
<br>
<strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</strong> <br>
NameSpace may change or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time. We  may also undergo a change of ownership. NameSpace will post an appropriate  notice of changes to the Privacy Policy and changes or ownership at <a href="http://www.namespaceinc.com">www.namespaceinc.com</a>. Privacy Policy  changes will apply to the information collected from the date NameSpace posts  the revised Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.namespaceinc.com">www.namespaceinc.com</a>,  as well as to existing information held by NameSpace.
