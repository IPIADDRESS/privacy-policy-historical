<h2 id="rights-with-regard-to-your-personal-information">Rights with regard to Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>In the event that you have provided Personal Information to Us in your use of the Site, We will provide you with information about whether We hold any of your Personal Information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your Personal Information by contacting Us at <a href="mailto:info@namely.com">info@namely.com</a>. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p>When acting as a service provider of Our Clients, Namely has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Information is provided to Namely through the Services. An individual who is or was employed by one of Our Clients and who seeks access to, or who seeks to correct, amend, object to the processing or profiling of, or to delete his/her Personal Information in the Platform, should direct his/her query to the HR department of the Client that uses the Platform and for which he/she works or used to work if he/she cannot make the appropriate changes via its access to the Platform provided by the Client.</p>

<p><strong>If located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have the following rights regarding your Personal Information We control:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Right of Access.</strong><br>
You can request details of your Personal Information We hold. We will confirm whether We are processing your Personal Information and We will disclose additional information including the types of Personal Information, the sources it originated from, the purpose and legal basis for the processing, the expected retention period and the safeguards regarding data transfers to non-EEA countries, subject to the limitations set out in applicable laws and regulations. We will provide you free of charge with a copy of your Personal Information but We may charge you a fee to cover Our administrative costs if you request further copies of the same information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Right of correction.</strong><br>
At your request, We will correct incomplete or inaccurate parts of your Personal Information, although We may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide US.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Right to be forgotten.</strong><br>
At your request, We will delete your Personal Information if:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>it is no longer necessary for Us to retain your Personal Information;</li>
      <li>you withdraw the consent which formed the legal basis for the processing of your Personal Information;</li>
      <li>you object to the processing of your Personal Information (see below) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for such processing;</li>
      <li>the Personal Information was processed illegally;</li>
      <li>the Personal Information must be deleted for Us to comply with Our legal obligations.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will decline your request for deletion if processing of your Personal Information is necessary:
    1. for Us to comply with Our legal obligations;
    2. for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or
    3. for the performance of a task in the public interest.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Right to restrict processing.</strong><br>
At your request, We will restrict the processing of your Personal Information if:
    <ol>
      <li>you dispute the accuracy of your Personal Information;</li>
      <li>your Personal Information was processed illegally and you request a limitation on processing rather than the deletion of your Personal Information;</li>
      <li>We no longer need to process your Personal Information, but you need your Personal Information in connection with the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim; or</li>
      <li>you object to the processing of your Personal Information (see below) pending verification as to whether an overriding legitimate ground for such processing exists.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We may continue to store your Personal Information to the extent required to ensure that your request to restrict processing is respected in the future.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Right to data portability.</strong><br>
At your request, We will provide you free of charge with your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format, if:
    <ol>
      <li>you provided Us with your Personal Information;</li>
      <li>the processing of your Personal Information is required for the performance of a contract; or</li>
      <li>the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Right to object.</strong><br>
Where We rely on Our legitimate interests (or that of a third party) to process your Personal Information, you have the right to object to this processing on grounds relating to your particular situation if you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. We will comply with your request unless We have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your rights and freedoms, or where the processing is in connection with the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. We will always comply with your objection to processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing.</strong><br>
You will not be subject to decisions with a legal or similarly significant effect (including profiling) that are based solely on the automated processing of your Personal Information, unless you have given Us your explicit consent or where they are necessary for the performance of a contract with Us.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong><br>
You have the right to withdraw any consent you may have previously given Us at any time.
In order to exercise your rights in this section We may ask you for certain identifying information to ensure the security of your Personal Information. To request to exercise any of the above rights, please contact Us at&nbsp;support@namely.com. We will respond to your request within 30 days or provide you with reasons for the delay.</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, We will not charge you any fees in connection with the exercise of your rights. If your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, for example, because of its repetitive character, We may charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of dealing with your request. If We refuse your request We will notify you of the relevant reasons.</p>

<p>In so far as practicable, We will notify Our Clients and third parties We have disclosed your Personal Information with of any correction, deletion, and/or restriction to the processing of your Personal Information. Please note that We cannot guarantee our Clients or other third parties will comply with your requests and We encourage you to contact them directly.</p>

<p>Please note that if you decide to exercise some of your rights, We may be unable to perform the actions necessary to achieve the purposes set out above or you may not be able to use or take full advantage of the Site and Mobile Apps.</p>

<p>Right to complain to a supervisory authority. If you are not satisfied with Our response, you have the right to complain or seek advice from a supervisory authority and/or bring a claim against Us in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to this Privacy Policy:</h2>

<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to Our information practices. Our use of Personal Information We collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If We make material changes in the way We collect or use information, We will notify you by posting an announcement on Our Site or sending you an email prior to the changes becoming effective.</p>
