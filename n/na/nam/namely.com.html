<h1>Namely Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="intro">
This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Namely, Inc. (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on <a href="http://namely.com">namely.com</a> (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and the services, features, content or applications we offer (collectively with the Site, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.  
</p>
<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”) gathered when you use or access the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.   
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>
<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>
The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request and collect some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.
</p>

<h3>Information You Provide Us:</h3>
<p>You may choose to provide us with certain information that could be Personal Information, such as your name, email address, and company. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by providing this information to us, we may contact you to send you information about the Services.  
</p>

<h3>Information Collected Using Cookies:</h3>
<p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services.  Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.  This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer. 
</p>
<h3>Aggregate Information:</h3>
<p>We collect statistical information about how both users, collectively, use the Services (“<strong>Aggregate Information</strong>”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you or your web browser.
</p>
<h2>How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?</h2>
<h3>Third Party Services:</h3>
<p>At times, you may be able to access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.
</p>
<h3>Email Communications with Us:</h3>
<p>As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as communications relating to promotions we are offering through the Services.

You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.</p>
<h3>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: </h3>
<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h3>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: </h3>

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.</p>
<h3>Information We Share With Your Consent: </h3>
<p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
<h2>What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?</h2>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.
</p>
