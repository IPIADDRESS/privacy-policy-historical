This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number. ICANN then requires all registrars to make your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number, as well as the creation and expiration dates of your domain name registration and the name server information associated with your domain name, to the public via an interactive Web page and a "port 43" WHOIS service.

Please note that we may not be able to control how members of the public may use the WHOIS Information.</dd>

			<dt>Agents:</dt>
			<dd>We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending postal mail and email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data.

			<dt>Compliance:</dt>
			<dd>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is required to comply with federal or state law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of NameJet, our users, or others.
