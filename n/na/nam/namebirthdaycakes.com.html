        <div class="gapl">
            <h4>5.1 How long will cookies stay on your browsing device?</h4>
            <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing the website that has set the cookie.

        <h2>6. Measuring our visitors</h2>
        <p>We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous â€“ so we donâ€™t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.</p>
        <h4>6.1 Google Analytics</h4>
        <div class="gapl">
            <p>We use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our websites or use our Service on your browser or mobile device. Google Analytics facilitates the assignment of data, sessions and interactions across several devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus the analysis of activities across devices. We share a unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service. The generated information is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. As IP anonymization is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP address within the Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. Google will use the collected data on our behalf to evaluate the use of the websites, to compile reports on website activity and to provide the website operator with other services related to website and Internet use. </p>
            <p>You can learn more about&nbsp;<a title="Google Analytics' privacy policy" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Google Analytics</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="How to opt out of Google Analytics" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">opt out if you wish</a>.</p>
        </div>
        
        
        <h2>7. Advertising</h2>
        <p>Ads appearing on our site may be delivered to Users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile non personal identification information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers</p>
        <div class="gapl">
            <h4>7.1 Google Adsense</h4>
            <p>Some of the ads may be served by Google. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to Users based on their visit to our Site and other sites on the Internet. DART uses "non personally identifiable information" and does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, etc. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>
