            <p align="center">How we gather information from users</p>
            <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to the services provided on our site or when you request access to certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you purchase products, participate in message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Nanacast.com and Internet Business Ideas Inc. also collect information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors.
