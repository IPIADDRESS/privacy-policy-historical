		What is our Cookies Policy?</h2>
	<p>5.1 &nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 1.6rem;">We, our third party service providers and our partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at our Website and across the Internet. "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as product preferences, to tell us which site pages you have visited and in what order. We use cookies and other technical information to personalize your visit to the Website, to analyze traffic on the Website and to track user trends, patterns and selections for authorized download and for technical reasons connected with your use of our site. Cookies can either be permanent (i.e. they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e. they last only until you close your browser).</span></p>
	<p>5.2 &nbsp; We utilize Google Analytics to analyze usage patterns of the Site.&nbsp; Google Analytics generates a cookie to capture information about your use of the Site which Google uses to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other related services.&nbsp; Google may use a portion of your <span class="caps">IP</span> address to identify their cookie, but this will not be associated with any other data held by Google.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 1.6rem;">From time to time we may implement additional features including &nbsp;Remarketing with Google Analytics to place ads on other sites you may visit after visiting our site,&nbsp; Google Display Network Impression Reporting to report how people’s interactions with our ads relate to their visits to our site, DoubleClick Platform integrations to help optimize our online advertising efforts, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to analyze information about our site visitors’ interests.&nbsp; These tools help us to better understand your interests and how to provide you with more relevant online advertising. We and third party vendors, including Google, may use first and third party cookies together to optimize and serve ads tailored to you based, for example, on what parts of our site you viewed. To opt out of Google Analytics cookies please visit </span><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 1.6rem;">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 1.6rem;">.

	<p><span style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5em;">5.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; We may also use "web beacons" that monitor your use of our Website. Web beacons (or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the <span class="caps">IP</span> (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the <span class="caps">URL</span> (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the web beacons appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via <span class="caps">HTML</span> capable e-mail, web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email. On their own, cookies or web beacons do not contain or reveal any Personal Data. However, if you choose to provide us with Personal Data, it can be linked to the anonymous data stored in the cookies and/or web beacons. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. However, if you prefer, you may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your web browser to display <span class="caps">HTML</span> emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some web beacons. To the extent that your browser permits such ‘do-not-track’ settings, we will recognize that setting and exclude you from analytics that collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites. However, please note that certain areas of our Website can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices.</span></p>
