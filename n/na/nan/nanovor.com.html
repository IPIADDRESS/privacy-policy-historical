<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		
<strong>1. Introduction</strong><br><br>

<strong>Kids, ask your parent or guardian to read this Privacy Policy before you give us any personal information about yourself, like your name, e-mail address, or telephone number.</strong><br><br>

Smith &amp; Tinker, Inc. ("Smith &amp; Tinker", "us", "we") is dedicated to providing a safe, fun play environment for people of all ages.  We are committed to protecting and safeguarding consumer privacy on the Internet, especially for children. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how we handle the personal information provided to us or collected on the Nanovor.com and HanoverHigh.com websites  and collected through the Nanovor software client and Nanoscope handheld unit (collectively, the "Nanovor Game").<br><br>

Smith &amp; Tinker is very sensitive to privacy issues with respect to children, especially those under the age of 13.  We ensure that our privacy policy and information practices adhere to the United States Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and are managed in accordance with the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit ("CARU"). We encourage parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children's on-line activities. Please see <a href="#section4">Section 4</a> below for more information on how Smith &amp; Tinker addresses children's privacy issues generally, as well as how we ensure adherence to COPPA and the CARU guidelines.<br><br>

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and your continued use of the Nanovor Game or any portion thereof constitutes acceptance of such changes. Please check this area periodically for updates to this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
	
IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF MAJORITY (DEFINED BELOW) IN YOUR JURISDICTION, MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN READS AND AGREES TO THIS AGREEMENT ON YOUR BEHALF.  THIS AGREEMENT IS A CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND SMITH &amp; TINKER.  "YOU" MEANS ANY PERSON PARTICIPATING IN THE NANOVOR GAME, PROVIDED THAT IF SUCH PERSON IS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE OR THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN YOUR JURISCIDTION, WHICHEVER IS OLDER ("AGE OF MAJORITY") IT ALSO INCLUDES SUCH PERSON'S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN.<br><br>
		
<strong>2. Information Smith &amp; Tinker Collects From You</strong><br>
Smith &amp; Tinker may collect information through your active submission of information or passively through use of automated technologies. Please see <a href="#section4">Section 4</a> below titled "Additional Notes Concerning Information Collected From Children" for the process we use to limit information collected from children under the age of the 13.<br><br>
	
<strong>Active Information Collection</strong><br>
Much of the personally identifiable information we collect from our visitors is submitted  voluntarily in response to our specific requests for such information.  For example, visitors may provide us with personal information during the registration process or in response to polls or other interactivity incorporated into the site. From time to time, such as during technical support communications, visitors may also choose to submit personally identifiable information directly to us via e-mail. We do not require users to provide any more information than necessary to participate in the related activity, although we do permit users to provide additional optional information if they would like to do so.<br><br>

The information we actively collect from you may include some or all of the following:

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Date of Birth</li>
<li>Address (including City, State, Country and/or Zip Code)</li>
<li>E-Mail address</li>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Gender</li>
</ul>

For kids under the age of 13 or for parents or guardians who want to set up a parental account, we will also collect the parent's or guardian's e-mail address. Establishment of a parental account may also require submission of certain personal information described in this Section with respect to the parent(s) or guardian(s).  We ask that parents or guardians assist a child under the age of 13 in registering to use the Nanovor Game.<br><br>

We may require you to submit billing information to pay any fees applicable to participation in the Nanovor Game (e.g., purchase of booster packs or tokens). Depending on the type of payment method, this billing information may include credit card or comparable payment account number, billing address, name on card/account, expiration date and security code.<br><br>
	
For some of our online activities - such as polls or surveys - we may ask users to provide information that is not personally identifiable, such as country of residence, hobbies or feedback or suggestions for the Nanovor Game.<br><br>

<strong>Passive Information Collection</strong><br>
As you navigate through the Nanovor Game, other information may be collected through use of technologies which are common among websites and online environments. For example, we currently track Internet protocol ("IP") addresses, which is a unique string of numbers assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider.<br><br>

We also use "cookies," which are small pieces of information or files that a website puts on your computer when you explore the Nanovor Game.  The cookies we use allow us to collect, store and sometimes track information about your use of the Nanovor Game or to save your settings (such as your username and password) or provide a customized experience.<br><br>

Within the Nanovor Game, we may also collect information on your in-game activities and the in-game assets you own.<br><br>

In addition to our active information collection efforts, we may also use technology to gather operational information about the technology you use, such as your browser, type of computer, operating systems and Internet service providers.  This information cannot be used to identify you personally.<br><br>
		
<strong>3. How Smith &amp; Tinker Uses And Discloses Your Personal Information</strong><br>
Smith &amp; Tinker uses your personal information to enable you to register for the Nanovor Game.  We also use this information to manage your use of the Nanovor Game and to support operation of the Nanovor Game generally. For example, we use your username and password to keep track of your progress in the Nanovor Game and to customize your user experience.  We will display your username when you are participating in the Nanovor Game and in connection with your chat room posts.<br><br>

We may use your e-mail address to send you e-mails about the Nanovor Game or other Smith &amp; Tinker products.  We may use information about your location to provide information to you about Nanovor-related events in your area.<br><br>

We use the billing information you provide to collect any fees due in connection with your use of the Nanovor Game.  We will not use your billing information for any other purpose.<br><br>

Although we do not generally give your personal information to third parties, we may disclose your information to Smith &amp; Tinker's vendors that provide technical support or other services to Smith &amp; Tinker related to the Nanovor Game. For example, we may provide your information to companies that host the Nanovor Game, provide security for online transactions and information, or process credit card information. However, these vendors may not use your information for any reason other than assisting Smith &amp; Tinker and are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and follow these guidelines.<br><br>

We reserve the right to disclose information if required to do so by law or by a regulatory authority. We may also disclose your information as part of an investigation or enforcement action relating to improper or illegal conduct in connection with the Nanovor Game.<br><br>

If a third party acquires the assets of Smith &amp; Tinker related to the Nanovor Game and its products and services (whether by sale, merger, change of control, bankruptcy or otherwise), your information may be transferred to the new owner(s). In such case, your information would remain subject to the provisions of the privacy policy that was applicable to your information immediately prior to the transfer.<br><br>

Smith &amp; Tinker may maintain aggregate data or other non-personally identifiable information about our users, such as usage statistics, online traffic patterns and user feedback. In addition to using this information to support operation of the Nanovor Game, Smith &amp; Tinker may disclose this anonymous information to third parties without restriction.  This information cannot be used to identify you.<br><br>

<strong>4. Additional Notes Concerning Information Collected From Children</strong><br>
Smith &amp; Tinker will not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. While we enable users to chat online during the Nanovor Game, we take measures to limit users' ability to communicate personal information through this chat function, including both filtered and canned chat technologies.<br><br>

<strong>Children Under the Age of 13</strong><br>
During the registration process, we collect only limited personal information from children identified as under 13 years of age (such as username and password).  When a child identifies that he or she is under the age of 13, we require him or her to provide us an e-mail address or other contact information for a parent or guardian. We obtain this information so that we can notify the parent or guardian and obtain his or her electronic consent prior to completing the registration process and collecting any more personal information from the child. We will not knowingly collect certain information from a child younger than 13, such as a postal address or a telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian.<br><br>

<strong>Parental Review of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
Parents have the ability to set up parental accounts to administer their children's accounts and review the personally identifiable information maintained by Smith &amp; Tinker from such accounts. If a child is under the age of 13, the child will be required to submit an e-mail address for a parent or guardian and such individual will have the opportunity to set up a parental account.  Although a child over the age of 13 may register without the electronic consent of a parent or guardian, a parent or guardian may also submit a request to Smith &amp; Tinker at the contact information below to review any personally identifiable information from such child. However, such requests will be subject to the parent or guardian demonstrating proper identification to Smith &amp; Tinker's satisfaction after reasonable investigation.<br><br>

<strong>Revoking Consent; Denying Disclosure</strong><br>
At any time, a parent or guardian of a child under 13 may revoke consent to the collection of the child's personal information, refuse to permit any additional collection and/or request the deletion of such information at any time by contacting Smith &amp; Tinker by e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@nanovor.com">privacy@nanovor.com</a> or by postal mail or telephone.  After such consent is revoked, we may prevent the child from participating in certain activities that require such information.<br><br>

<strong>5. How Smith &amp; Tinker Protects Your Information</strong><br>
We work hard to protect your personal information. We use both technical and procedural methods to maintain the integrity and security of our databases, including giving users a unique username and password for access to the Nanovor Game, SSL encryption for data transfer, firewalls, and restricted access to data.<br><br>

However, the safety and security of your information also depends on you. You should never share your password with anyone else and you should always log off before leaving your computer. If you believe someone has unauthorized access to your password or account, please contact us promptly.<br><br>

The Nanovor Game may contain links to other websites operated by third parties that may be of interest to you. When you follow a link and leave the Nanovor Game, you do so at your own risk because we do not control such third party websites. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of such third party websites before providing them with any personal information.<br><br>

<strong>6. Accessing Or Correcting Information Collected By Smith &amp; Tinker; Expressing Your Preferences For Our Use Of Your Information</strong><br>
You have the following choices regarding the personally identifiable information you provide for Smith &amp; Tinker to use:<br><br>

You may send us an e-mail message at <a href="mailto:privacy@nanovor.com">privacy@nanovor.com</a> to request access to review, correct or delete any personally identifiable information maintained on our systems that you or your child has provided to us. To protect your privacy, we will respond only to e-mail messages sent from the e-mail account that you specified (or was given by your child) during the account registration process.<br><br>

You may also opt out of receiving newsletters and other promotional materials from Smith &amp; Tinker by notifying us at <a href="mailto:privacy@nanovor.com">privacy@nanovor.com</a>.<br><br>
	
If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you set your browser to refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Nanovor Game may then be inaccessible or not function properly.<br><br>

<strong>7. General</strong><br>
Smith &amp; Tinker reserves the right to change its privacy policy in its sole discretion. In such case, Smith &amp; Tinker will post the new privacy policy on the Nanovor Game and the effective date of the new privacy policy will be clearly marked. With respect to children under the age of 13, Smith &amp; Tinker will not use personally identifiable information from such children in ways that are materially different from this version of the Privacy Policy unless the parent(s) or guardian(s) are notified of, and consent to, the new changes to the privacy policy.<br><br>

Your use of the Nanovor Game is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our <a href="/terms-of-use.php">Terms of Use</a>. Among other things, the Terms of Use establishes disclaimers of warranties, limitations on Smith &amp; Tinker's liability, choice of law and venue, and restrictions on your use of the Nanovor Game. Please review this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use carefully, because if you do not agree with our practices, your ultimate choice is not to use the Nanovor Game.<br><br>

<strong>10. A Final Note To Parents</strong><br>
We believe the Internet provides unprecedented positive opportunities for children's entertainment, education and personal growth, and are committed to doing our part to harness its potential to create a fun and enriching experience for our users.<br><br>

Parental guidance and involvement are essential to ensuring that children have a safe, rewarding and fun online experience.

These sites provide valuable information to help parents and children understand options and express preferences about information that is collected online and how it is used.  Your involvement will help your child learn responsible online practices, help steer them to safe and age-appropriate sites, and help ensure that their online experiences are positive, enriching and fun.<br><br>
