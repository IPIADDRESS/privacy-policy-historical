"Personal Information" includes, for example, a first name or initial and last name; a home or other physical address; an email address or other online contact information; and/or a telephone number. When you make a purchase, we will also collect your credit or debit card account information or other similar payment information ("Payment Information").</p>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Registration Data</h3>
            <p>When you sign up to receive our products and services, you and/or your utility company are required to provide certain information in order to allow us to provide such service.   This information may include your name, Social Security number, date of birth, physical address (including billing, mailing and service addresses), email address, phone number, utility account information (including your billing and payment history, energy consumption data, and eligibility information with respect to medical, elderly, disabled, economic development and other incentives) and Payment Information.

We may require similar information when you register to become one of our Independent Representatives. We may receive updates of this information from time to time throughout our provision of services to you.   You may cancel this authorization at any time by providing written notice thereof to us or by calling us at 1-888-313-9086; however, doing so may result in our decision to terminate your service.</p>
            <p>When you download one of our mobile applications such as our rewards application, the information we collect through such application on your mobile device will be indicated at such time.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Information You Choose to Share</h3>
            <p>We also receive all information that you voluntarily submit to us, whether through this website or our affiliated websites, mobile applications or social networking pages, by phone or email or otherwise.</p>

            <h3>Information Collected From Others</h3>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Information Automatically Collected</h3>
            <p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes, without limitation, Internet Protocol addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.</p>
            <p>Our websites may use other technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, or other forms of local storage, including HTML5 local storage in order to collect and track information about visitors to our websites. Information collected from these types of technologies, and from cookies and Flash cookies, is collectively referred to as "website usage data."   If you do not want to receive browser cookies, you may be able to set your browser to reject them. If you wish to disable or delete Flash cookies, you should consult the Help file for your Flash application, and/or visit http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html. However, if you turn cookies off (whether browser or Flash cookies), you may not have access to some of our website's features and services. The other technologies that our websites use may not be able to be disabled; if you are concerned about this, you should not use our websites.</p>
            <p>Some technologies used on our websites permit our advertising network service providers to serve our advertisements to you as you browse on third party sites. Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.  These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.</p>
            <p>We may also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile applications on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p>
