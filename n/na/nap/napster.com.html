Rhapsody Privacy Policy
</h1>
<p>
Rhapsody International Inc. ("RI") is committed to protecting the privacy of your Personal Information (defined below). This Privacy Policy explains how RI collects and utilizes Personal Information to enhance your Rhapsody experience during your use of Rhapsody products and services.

</p>
<h1>

</p>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
RI uses your Personal Information to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver to you and bill you for RI products and services, and communicate with you concerning your account and customer service issues.

<h1>
WHEN AND HOW DOES RI SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?
</h1>
<p>
RI does not use your Personal Information for purposes incompatible with those listed above.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, access to certain products and services, such as content subscription products, the RI Social Network, or products distributed by third parties may require the provision of Personal Information to a third party, such as a content provider, email provider, social media site, advertising network, or distributor. This Privacy Policy does not limit RI’s ability to share aggregated or anonymized Personal Information with such third party partners and affiliates.   RI may also receive your Personal Information from third party service partners and advertisers in an effort to facilitate personalization of your content preferences. The third party's use of such information is governed by that party's privacy policy, and RI's use is governed by this privacy policy. Please visit the privacy policy of the content partner to make sure you understand how they use the personal information you provide to them. If you do not wish for such a transfer to take place, you should not register for the applicable product or service. You may also choose to control your privacy settings using the NAI opt-out tool which allows consumers to opt out of the behavioral advertising delivered by NAI member companies as explained below in the section regarding Cookie usage. Additionally, RI may be required to provide specific access and usage information to certain content providers and rights holders as a condition of content licensing. In such cases, RI may provide content usage, access, demographic and other information without your personally identifiable information (your name, billing information, email address) to the content provider. RI is not responsible for nor does it assume liability for any third party’s use of Personal Information in violation of its own privacy policy or applicable law.
</p>
<p>
RI may disclose relevant information about its customers to our contractors (e.g. a customer service contractor or a credit card clearing service) in order for them to provide specific services for RI to better serve our customers. RI's contractors are bound by contractual requirements to keep the information they process secure..  
</p>
<p>
If RI merges with, is acquired by, or transfers ownership to another entity, RI may share your Personal Information with that entity.  Any such disclosures will remain protected by the then-current Privacy Policy.  In the event that RI files for bankruptcy RI will not sell any Personal Information or user data so long as the Rhapsody service is terminated as a result of the bankruptcy.
</p>
<p>
Also, RI may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law; (b) comply with the order of a competent judicial authority in any jurisdiction; (c) comply with legal process served on RI; (d) protect and defend the rights or property of RI; or (e) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of RI products or the public at large. 
</p>
<p>
Your credit card will be charged for the renewal term of your Service on your billing date ("Billing Date"), based on the type of subscription (e.g., on a particular date each month for a monthly subscription; on the three-month date for a quarterly subscription; on the anniversary for an annual subscription, etc.). If, however, your Activation Date is on the 29th, 30th or 31st day of a month, and your Billing Date does not exist in a particular month because there are fewer than thirty-one (31) days in the month payment is due, your Billing Date for that particular renewal will be on the last day of the month in which your Billing Date would otherwise be. 
</p>
<p>
RI websites and products contain links to other websites and products. RI is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or products. Please visit the privacy policies of these third party sites in order to understand their privacy policies and data collection practices. 
</p>
<h2>
Obligatory or Optional Nature of the Requested Information
</h2>
<p>
Some of the Personal Information collected by RI is necessary to provide you with the RI product or service you choose and to optimize the delivery of audio and video data to your computer. RI software may include the opportunity to disable certain software features to increase your level of privacy. However, certain technical information (e.g., zip code, product id, GUID) may be automatically transmitted between networked servers to authenticate access to products and services, enable their delivery, or optimize your media delivery experience.
</p>
<h1>
HOW DOES RI SECURE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
</h1>
<p>
RI understands that it is a privilege to have you as a customer and uses reasonable measures to safeguard your personal information.  RI keeps customer’s financial information secure through a variety of industry standard protections including, use of systems to monitor and alert in the event of a network attack, physical security precautions, and video surveillance.  RI consumer payments and direct debit billing are processed through a tokenized system implemented by a secure payment processor; and, RI does not store consumer credit card data on its servers.  RI also uses Paypal and Amazon Payments as secure alternative payment providers.

Please note that using the NAI opt-out tool does not necessarily mean that you will no longer receive online advertising; instead, using the NAI opt-out toolmeans that advertisers who are members of the NAI organization will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.

<h1>
NO ERROR FREE PERFORMANCE
</h1>
<p>
RI customarily releases alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products are still in a test phase, RI may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, RI welcomes feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve RI products generally, in all stages of release. RI does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. RI will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and will take prompt corrective action when RI learns of any failure to comply with it. RI shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy.
