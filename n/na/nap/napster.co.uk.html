		    <strong class="cheadline">NAPSTER PRIVACY POLICY</strong> <br>
		    <br>
		    Effective March   31, 2006 <br>
		    <br>
		    If you need Napster Customer Support assistance, please <a href="http://www.napster.co.uk/support" target="_blank" class="clinks">click here</a>. Sending an   email to Napster's privacy officer will cause a delay in response and   assistance.<br>
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    Welcome to Napster's online music services available at <a href="http://www.napster.co.uk" target="_blank" class="clinks">www.napster.co.uk</a> (the   "Service"). We value your privacy, and we want you to know what information we   collect and what we do with it. <br>
		    <br>
		    Napster is a licensee of the TRUSTe   Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organisation whose mission   is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of   fair information practices. This privacy policy covers the site   www.napster.co.uk and the Napster music service accessible from that site.   Because Napster wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has   agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices   reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. <br>
		    <br>
		    If you have questions or concerns   regarding this statement, you should first contact us at privacy@napster.co.uk.   If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not   been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe through <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank" class="clinks">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>. TRUSTe   will then serve as a liaison with Napster to resolve your concerns. <br>
		    <br>
		    The   TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site,   and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded   from the site. <br>
		    <br>
		    Napster complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set   out by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention   of data from the European Union. <br>
		    <br>
		    From time to time, we may make changes   to this policy, so please review it frequently. Whenever we make a change, we   will post or otherwise make available the revised policy. We will endeavor to   post the changes before they become effective. The effective date of the most   recent version of this policy will appear at the top of this page. This policy   applies to any information we collect from you. If we make any material changes   to this policy, we will notify you here, by email or by means of a notice on our   home page and/or sign-page that you must view to enter the service. <br>
		    <br>
		    WHEN   WE COLLECT INFORMATION <br>
		    <br>
		    We have several areas where you can submit   information to us, and we also have features that automatically collect   information from users of our Service. <br>
		    <br>
		    INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US. We   have certain areas where we ask you to provide information to us: • <em>Registration</em>. You must register with us to use our Service. We may also   offer options for you to sign up for our mailing lists without having to use any   product or service. <br>
		    • <em>Napster Light</em>. During registration to our   general service or "<strong>Napster Light</strong>" (which may be used without charge),   you must provide your email address, and you will be asked to choose a member   name and password. If you are accessing our service through a Partner (defined   below), your member name and password may be pre-selected depending upon the   particular Partner through whom you accessed the Service. You will also be asked   during registration, but not required, to provide further information about   yourself (such as favourite music genre, Instant Messenger client, if you have   one, , city, county, interests, brief bio) for your "Public Profile" that other   Service users will be able to access as part of Napster's "Community Features"   as described further below. After you register for the Napster Light service, if   you decide to obtain tracks or purchase any other items from Napster, you will   be required to provide credit card and personal billing information.<br>
		    • <em>Subscription Service</em>. During registration to our "<strong>Subscription   Service</strong>" (for which you must pay a subscription fee), you will be required   to provide your credit card and billing information. For certain promotional   offers, you may be able to access the Subscription Service without first   providing a credit card. The Subscription Service has a standard tier, as well   as a premium "Napster To Go" tier, for which you may register and pay an   additional amount. <br>
		    • <em>Communications from Us and Mailing Lists</em>. In   order to keep our members informed about the operation of our Service, we may   send e-mails and announcements to your personal email address that you have   provided to us upon registration. We may also send promotional emails to your   service "Inbox" (described below). For additional information and offers, we   give our members the option of joining our mailing lists. We may also allow you   to choose whether to receive mailings from record labels and other promotional   partners that we think will be of interest to you (see "With Whom We Share Your   Information" below). You can change your options in the "My Account" section of   the service. Each promotional e-mail from us will come with instructions for how   to unsubscribe from the mailing list. <br>
		    • <em>Communications with Us</em>. Our   Service has features that allow you to submit information to us (such as when   contacting us with a question or problem related to the service). We may retain   your emails and other information you submit to us for our internal purposes and   to help us to serve you better. <br>
		    • <em>Communications with Friends</em>. Our   Service may also have certain features that allow you to send information to   others (such as via a "Tell a Friend" or e-card feature). Currently, all Service   members will be provided with a Napster "Inbox" that allows them to exchange   messages with other Service members and also to send messages to nonmembers.   Messages may be addressed to a person's Napster member name (which will go to   their Inbox) or to any personal email address. Messages may contain compilations   of Napster tracks as well as a brief amount of text. In order to host this   feature, for as long as you keep messages in your Inbox, Napster will keep   copies of those messages. We may monitor such messages via electronic software   or personnel to check for obscenity, defamation or other types of abusive   language, as well as for content that may infringe our rights or the rights of   others, all of which we may remove at any time. We will not otherwise access   these messages except in unusual cases, including but not limited to times when   we receive specific complaints related to a particular message or are compelled   to do so by law. To maintain storage capacity, we expect to regularly delete   message files, including messages in any user's Inbox, that are older than 30   days and we reserve the right to do so more or less frequently. Also for   administrative purposes, we will keep a mail log that will include a record of   which users sent messages and to which users or email addresses they were sent.   We will use the addressee information you enter only to send the emails you   request. <br>
		    • <em>Community Features</em>. We also may offer community features   designed to help members find songs they like, for example, by viewing songs   that other members have recently streamed (for Subscription Service members) or   made part of their personal music collections. Currently, if you are a Service   member, your Napster member name will be shown in connection with these features   (and other members will be able to access your Public Profile) unless you choose   not to participate, either during registration or at any time afterwards in the   "My Account" section of the service. Subscription Service members may also   access features such as message boards that allow members to communicate with   each other. All personal information you send or post via community features,   including in your Public Profile, becomes public information, and we are not   responsible for any information you choose to make public. We may, but are not   obligated to, monitor such community features via electronic software or   personnel but only to check for obscenity, defamation or other types of abusive   language, as well as for content that may infringe our rights or the rights of   others, all of which we may remove at any time. <br>
		    • <em>Competitions and Prize   Draws</em>. We may also hold competitions or prize draws in connection with the   Service, or in partnership with one or more of our Partners or sponsors, as part   of which, we may request contact information from you when you enter. We will   use the information you provide to conduct the competitions or prize draws and   for other purposes to which you consent. If we offer competitions or prize draws   with third parties, we may share the information we obtain from you with them.   If that is the case, then we will notify you that we are sharing your personal   information with such partner at the point where we collect it and you will be   able to choose whether or not to participate in the applicable competition or   prize draw. <br>
		    • <em>Surveys</em>. We may occasionally ask you to participate in   voluntary surveys. These surveys are intended to improve your service experience   and any information you provide we may associate with your member name for   future use. Any personally identifying information collected will be used only   by us unless we specify otherwise. However, we may share aggregate survey result   information with others. <br>
		    <br>
		    CHILDREN <br>
		    <br>
		    Napster does not allow   registration for the Service from children under the age of 13. Children over 13   must have their registration approved by a parent or legal guardian who must   tick the consent both to enter into the provision of Service agreement with   Napster. The parent or legal guardian is therefore responsible for checking all   details given by the child and Napster encourages all parents and legal   guardians to provide their own email address for contact purposes. Napster also   encourages all parents and legal guardians to instruct their children in the   safe and responsible use of the internet and disclosure of their personal   information. <br>
		    <br>
		    INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES. • You may also   separately provide registration and purchasing information to websites,   retailers, OEMs, software suppliers or other commerce, product or service   providers through which we provide access to registration for our Service   ("<strong>Partners</strong>"). Depending on the particular promotion, when you register   for the Service through a Partner, that Partner may provide us with a   user/member name that you already use with that Partner's products or services   or that you or it have otherwise pre-selected as part of the promotion.<br>
		    • As   you are using our Service, you may click through certain links or promotions   that will enable you to purchase products or use services provided by Partners   or other sites or commerce providers. Some of those entities may share with us   certain information that you provide to them. By clicking through to those links   or promotions, you agree to allow us to receive and use any information, except   for credit card information (account number, expiration date) that you may   provide to such entities, under the same terms as if you provided it to us   directly.<br>
		    • You may also separately share your information with other sites   or entities, such as those that create professional marketing lists, which may   agree to share your information with us. Whether or not any third party actually   shares your information and to what extent they do share with us will depend on   their agreement with us and their individual privacy policy. Napster is not   responsible for, and will assume no liability if a Partner or other site or   commerce provider collects, uses or shares, any information about you in   violation of its own privacy policy, or applicable law.<br>
		    • We may purchase   marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to   better target our advertising and to provide relevant offers in which we think   you may be interested. To enrich our profiles of individual customers, we may   tie this information to the personally identifiable information they have   provided to us. <br>
		    <br>
		    AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION <br>
		    <br>
		    Napster Client. After   you register for the Napster Service, you will be prompted to download our   Napster software application ("<strong>Napster Client</strong>"). In order to make sure   the Napster Client is functioning at its best, from time to time we may send the   Napster Client automatic fixes, support files, etc. Napster employs software   that is used to protect the copyrights associated with the tracks you listen to   or obtain. In order to make sure that artists and copyright owners receive   applicable royalties, this software identifies and counts the songs you have   obtained and/or accessed including, if you are a Napster To Go member, tracks   that you may have listened to offline on compatible portable devices. At the   aggregate level (i.e., not tied to the personally identifying information of any   user), we use this data to report and pay royalties, for internal analysis and   we share this data with certain Partners for their own analysis. We do not share   your personally identifying usage data with any third parties. We may use your   personally identifying usage data for a variety of service-related purposes. <br>
		    <br>
		    From time to time, the security on the Napster Client software may be   upgraded by our supplier, which is currently Microsoft. Microsoft advises us   that for security upgrades, your player will connect to an Internet site   operated by Microsoft and will be sent a security file, along with a unique   identifier, which does not contain any personal information about you and is not   used to personally identify you or track your activities. Microsoft uses this   information to prevent security breaches that could affect you. For more   information, please feel free to read Microsoft's privacy policy at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/windowsmedia/software/v7/privacy.asp#_Security_Upgrade_(Individualization)" target="_blank" class="clinks">http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/windowsmedia/software/v7/privacy.asp#_Security_Upgrade_(Individualization)</a>. <br>
		    <br>
		    Further, when you access the Service through a Partner and download the   Napster Client, we will add certain of your registration information (such as   your member name and, if applicable, the Partner or promotion through which you   registered) to the registry settings on your computer's hard drive, so that we   can recognise which of our Partners or other sign-in pages to send to you when   you log on to the Service. <br>
		    <br>
		    <u>Cookies</u>. We use cookies for several   purposes. Within the Napster Service, we use what are commonly called "session"   cookies, meaning that they only last as long as you are online. We use these   cookies to identify you as a valid member so that we can deliver music to you,   to ensure that no one else can sign on simultaneously with your account from   another computer and to help us personalise your service experience based on   your registration preferences (such as genre choice, your connection speed, and   your preference with regard to receiving songs that contain explicit lyrics and   the country you live in. We may also use session cookies to help us facilitate   any promotions or surveys that we provide. These cookies do not contain any   personally identifying information and we do not store data collected by them. <br>
		    <br>
		    As part of the sign-in process, we may also use what are commonly called   "persistent" cookies which stay with you after your session is over and you are   offline. We use these cookies in connection with a sign-in feature that allows   you to save your member name and password so that the next time you sign in,   these fields will be prepopulated for you. If we make this cookie available, it   can only be activated if you select that option during your sign-in. If you   select that option you can always deselect it each time you sign-in. <br>
		    <br>
		    We   sometimes use cookies, as well as tracking technology, such as web beacons,   within the promotional emails that we send to our members or advertisements for   our Service. These technologies help us to track, for example, whether an e-mail   recipient has completed an event, such as signing up for a free trial. The   generated information is related to non-personally identifying customer   identification numbers and is only analyzed at aggregate levels. We may send   these emails via third-party service providers that act on our behalf. <br>
		    <br>
		    We sometimes use third party service providers to help us track the   activity and user flows within our service. These third parties may use   temporary cookies and/or web beaconing technology to facilitate such tracking.   Such tracking would track an individual user's movements but the data would not   be tracked in a personally identifiable way. Such data would be stored and   analysed on an aggregated basis for the purposes of internal analysis by Napster   to improve the Service. <br>
		    <br>
		    Our advertisers and other third parties whose   products or services are promoted on our site may also use cookies, and we   advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies   and other privacy practices. <br>
		    <br>
		    You are not obliged to accept cookies. Most   web browsers automatically accept cookies but you may modify your browser so   that it will not accept cookies. Please use the help tools provided with your   browser to find out how to achieve this. <br>
		    <br>
		    Other. In order to personalise   our service for your enjoyment and to monitor and improve the performance of our   technology, we capture other data such as members' search criteria and results.   We only share this data on an aggregate basis. Also for internal purposes, we   gather information such as date, time, connection speed and IP address of all   service users. We keep this information for our internal security audit log,   aggregate trend analysis, and system administration. <br>
		    <br>
		    <strong>WITH WHOM WE   SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br>
		    Your information may be shared with our US parent   company Napster LLC and with any other companies within our group. If you   consent to receive information from our record label partners during   registration, we may share your registration information with those partners   and, if we so indicate to you, with other promotional Partner(s) that may have   facilitated your registration. Our Partners' and record label partners' and   other's use of such information, including targeted promotions, will be subject   to our and their privacy policy. Any personal registration data that we share is   not authorised by us to be transferred by the recipients of that data to third   parties or used for mass distribution of emails or other activities that might   be considered "spamming." We do not share your credit card account information   with Partners or any other third parties. <br>
		    <br>
		    Personal information collected   on this site may be stored and processed in the United States by our parent   company Napster, LLC or, if shared with them as described herein, by our record   label partners or by any other Partner, or may be stored and processed in any   other country in which Napster, LLC, such Partners or record label partners   maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of   information outside the UK. If we intend to share your information with a   Partner based outside the EU, you will be notified prior to collection of that   information and if you do not want your information to be shared, you will be   able to choose not to allow your information to be shared by not using or   signing up for that particular service, promotion or contest. Napster, LLC   abides by the safe harbor framework as set out by the U.S. Department of   Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European   Union. <br>
		    <br>
		    Other than as set out in this policy, we do not share your   personally identifying information with other companies. • We will share   information with companies acting as our agents in providing our Service to you,   all of which agree to use it only for that purpose and to keep the information   secure and confidential.<br>
		    • Also, entities into which our company is merged,   or to which our assets, site or operations have been transferred, will be able   to use your personal information under the terms of this privacy policy. You   will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our website and in our   service for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal   information.<br>
		    • We will also disclose information we maintain when required to   do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other   legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in   special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is   necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be   causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally)   our rights or property.<br>
		    • You should also be aware that courts of equity,   such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain   circumstances to permit your information to be shared or transferred to third   parties without your permission. <br>
		    <br>
		    <strong>SECURITY </strong><br>
		    <br>
		    Napster   endeavors to protect the security of your personal information and your choices   for its intended use. We use secure SSL technology to protect the transmission   of sensitive information such as your credit card number. We store your personal   information on a secure server, and use procedures designed to protect the   information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure,   alteration or destruction. <br>
		    <br>
		    <strong>ACCESS/CHOICE </strong><br>

Members can also contact a customer   service representative by <a href="http://www.napster.co.uk/helprequest_form.html" target="_blank" class="clinks">clicking   here</a> to review their accounts and you will receive a response within a   maximum of 72 hours from our receipt. <br>
