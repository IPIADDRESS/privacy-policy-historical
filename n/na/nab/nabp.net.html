<p class="excerpt"></p>


<section id="page_content" class="privacy policy">
<h3>WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p>The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy® (NABP®) is committed to protecting the privacy of our Web site users’ personal information. This policy applies with respect to the information that we collect from you through the NABP Internet site (Site), located at www.nabp.net. NABP may amend this Policy at any time and at its sole discretion. Amendments to this Policy will be posted on the Site and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this Site following the posting of an amended Policy signifies your acceptance thereof.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>

<p>When you request services, request information, subscribe to materials, or register for meetings, we may ask you to provide personal information to complete these transactions and deliver the services or materials.
