    Privacy Policy
  </h1>

<p><em>Last Updated: January 30, 2015</em></p>

<h2>WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<p>Protecting the privacy of our website users’ personal information is important to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy<sup>®</sup> (NABP<sup>®</sup>). This Privacy Policy (Policy) applies with respect to the information that we collect from you through the NABP Internet site (Site), located at <a href="http://www.nabp.net"><em>www.nabp.net</em></a>. NABP may amend this Policy at any time and at its sole discretion. NABP will post the amended Policy on this Site and will include the “Last Updated” date to reflect the effective date of the latest amendments. Your continued use of this Site following the posting of an amended Policy signifies your acceptance of the terms of the Policy as amended.</p>

<h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>

<p>When you request services, request information, subscribe to materials, or register for meetings, we may ask you to provide personal information to complete these transactions and deliver the services or materials. The types of personal information you provide to us may include contact information such as your name, address, telephone number, Social Security number and/or email address, or other unique information such as user IDs and passwords. We may also collect contact preference information and educational and/or employment background data.</p>

<p>In addition to the information you provide, NABP may collect non-personal information during your visit to the Site. Such anonymous information includes, but is not limited to, certain standard data that your browser sends to the Site such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at the NABP Site. We may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address or click stream behavior (ie, the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Site).</p>

<p>Personal demographic and profile data may be used to tailor your experience at the Site, for example, to show you content you might be interested in.</p>

<p>NABP may engage third-party service providers to support or administer NABP services, including this Site. These service providers may collect personal information from you on behalf of NABP. For example, NABP engages a third-party service provider, which collects email addresses from individuals who subscribe to <em>NABP e-News</em>.</p>

<p>NABP might store some information on your computer hard drive in the form of a “cookie” to assist you with purchasing services from NABP, to speed the log-in process, or to store information, such as personal preferences. Additionally NABP’s third-party service providers may use information obtained through “cookies” for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity and Internet usage.&nbsp; You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.&nbsp;Please note, that if you refuse the use of cookies you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you pay for services, credit card information may be collected by NABP through its Site, or you may be securely transferred from the Site to an NABP third-party service provider, which may collect credit card information and other personal information for the purpose of processing your payment on behalf of NABP. Credit card information which is obtained by NABP through its Site is handled securely, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as payment card industry standards for such information.</p>

<h2>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>NABP uses your personal information to deliver the service(s) you have requested and may use it for Association operations, including quality assurance purposes, to contact you on behalf of the boards of pharmacy in the event of an emergency, to deliver to you information about NABP, such as promotional material, or to contact you about your account.</p>

<p>NABP does not sell to third parties&nbsp;any personal or financial information gathered on this Site. NABP may share your personal information with licensing agencies including, but not limited to, boards of pharmacy, pharmacy technician organizations if you are a certified pharmacy technician, or regulatory or law enforcement agencies as permitted or required by law.</p>

<p>NABP may disclose your personal information if required under the law or to comply with legal process, to protect or defend NABP rights, property, staff, or members, or the rights, property, or safety of others.</p>

<p>NABP may provide its third-party service providers with personal information for purposes of delivering the services you requested. For example, NABP may provide your name, address, and phone number to our testing vendor if you request examination services through the Site. Such third parties are required to protect your personal information in conformance with applicable state and federal laws. In addition, a third-party service provider may collect personal information from you directly, such as when you submit an email address in order to join an <em>NABP e-News</em> list. The privacy policy of such provider may apply to its use of your information. The provider’s policy may differ from this Policy, and you may wish to contact the provider directly for more information.</p>

<p>NABP does not track users if their web browsers communicate a “do not track” signal to the Site. The use of tracking technologies by third-party service providers on the Site is not covered by the Policy. These providers may use cookies or other methods to support their tracking technologies; however, NABP does not control these technologies.</p>

<p>In the course of conducting Association business, NABP staff may access personal information for the purposes stated in this Policy. Staff are required to maintain the confidentiality of personal information and are prohibited from unlawfully disclosing such information.</p>

<p>When personal information is no longer needed, NABP disposes of the personal data it has collected in such a manner as to protect the security and confidentiality of the material, such as shredding, erasing, or rendering personal information to be unreadable.</p>
