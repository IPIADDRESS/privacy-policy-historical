    <h3>Who do we share your personal information with?</h3>
<p><b>To make sure we can meet your specific needs and for the purposes described in ‘Using your personal information’, we sometimes need to share your personal information with others.</b>We may share your information with other organisations for any purposes for which we use your information.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sharing with the Group&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We may share your personal information with other Group members. This could depend on the product or service you have applied for and the Group member you are dealing with.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sharing at your request&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We may need to share your personal information with:</p>
<ul>
<li>your representative or any person acting on your behalf (for example, financial advisers, lawyers, settlement agents, accountants, executors, administrators, trustees, guardians, brokers or auditors); and</li>
<li>your referee such as your employer (to confirm details about you).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharing with Credit Reporting bodies</h3>
<p>We may disclose information about you to a credit reporting body if you are applying for credit or you have obtained credit from us or if you guarantee or are considering guaranteeing the obligations of another person to us or you are a director of a company that is loan applicant or borrower or guarantor. &nbsp;When we give your information to a credit reporting body, it may be included in reports that the credit reporting body gives other organisations (such as other lenders) to help them assess your credit worthiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of that information may reflect adversely on your credit worthiness, for example, if you fail to make payments or if you commit a serious credit infringement (like obtaining credit by fraud). That sort of information may affect your ability to get credit from other lenders.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sharing with third parties&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties outside of the Group, including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>those involved in providing, managing or administering your product or service;</li>

<li>organisations involved in surveying or registering a security property or which otherwise have an interest in such property;</li>
<li>real estate agents;</li>

<li>our accountants, auditors or lawyers and other external advisers;</li>
<li>rating agencies to the extent necessary to allow the rating agency to rate particular investments;</li>
<li>any party involved in securitising your facility, including re-insurers and underwriters, loan servicers, trust managers, trustees and security trustees;</li>
<li>guarantors and prospective guarantors of your facility;</li>

<p>Overseas organisations may be required to disclose information we share with them under a foreign law. In those instances, we will not be responsible for that disclosure.</p>
<p>We will not share any of your credit information with a credit reporting body, unless it has a business operation in Australia. We are not likely to share credit eligibility information (that is, credit information we obtain about you from a credit reporting body or that we derive from that information) with organisations unless they have business operations in Australia.

<p>We will give you access to your information in the form you want it where it’s reasonable and practical (such as a copy of a phone call you may have had with us – we can put it on a disk for you). &nbsp;We may charge you a small fee to cover our costs when giving you access, but we’ll always check with you first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re not always required to give you access to your personal information. Some of the situations where we don’t have to give you access include when:</p>
<ul>
<li>we believe there is a threat to life or public safety;</li>
<li>there is an unreasonable impact on other individuals;</li>
<li>the request is frivolous;</li>
<li>the information wouldn’t be ordinarily accessible because of legal proceedings;</li>
<li>it would prejudice negotiations with you;</li>
<li>it would be unlawful;</li>
<li>it would jeopardise taking action against serious misconduct by you;</li>
<li>it would be likely to harm the activities of an enforcement body (e.g. the police); or</li>
<li>it would harm the confidentiality of our commercial information.</li>
</ul>
<p>In relation to credit eligibility information , the exceptions may differ.</p>
<p>If we can’t provide your information in the way you’ve requested, we will tell you why in writing. If you have concerns, you can complain. See ‘Contact Us’.</p>

<p>We must:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide you access to the information within 30 days (unless unusual circumstances apply);</li>
<li>make the information clear and accessible; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>ask you to check with credit reporting bodies what information they hold about you.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<p>We are not required to give you access to this information if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it would be unlawful; or</li>
<li>it would be likely to harm the activities of an enforcement body (e.g. the police).</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also restrict what we give you if it would harm the confidentiality of our commercial information.</p>
<p>If we refuse to give access to any credit eligibility information, we will tell you why in writing. If you have concerns, you can complain to our external dispute resolution scheme or the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Contact credit reporting bodies if you think you have been the victim of a fraud</h3>
<p>If you believe that you have been or are likely to be the victim of fraud (including identify fraud), you can request a credit reporting body not to use or disclose the information they hold about you. If you do this, the credit reporting body mustn't use or disclose the information during an initial 21 day period without your consent (unless the use or disclosure is required by law). &nbsp;This is known as a ban period.</p>
<p>If, after the initial 21 day ban period, the credit reporting body believes on reasonable grounds that you continue to be or are likely to be the victim &nbsp;of fraud, the credit reporting body must extend the ban period as they think reasonable in the circumstances. &nbsp;The credit reporting body must give you a written notice of the extension.</p>
