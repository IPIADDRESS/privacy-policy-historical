We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

<br><br><b>1. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</b>
<br><br>

<ol>
	<li>We collect information on Users in order to facilitate the operation of the nabbesh Platform.

	</li><li>The nabbesh Search Facility is available to all Users. Users are also invited to enter personal information which provides an enhanced set of search results. 
		<ol>
			<li>When you sign up for a nabbesh Account (or 'Homepage') or other nabbesh services or promotions that require registration, we ask you for personal information such as name and email address. After you have created your Homepage we provide you with the option to add additional personal information such as phone number. We may combine the information that you submit under your Homepage with information from other nabbesh, in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services or to suggest to you people you might know, or other people who may have skills or hobbies of interest to you. For certain information, we give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information within your account settings page.
			</li><li>nabbesh provides an invitation service when you register with the Platform. If you choose (consent or opt in) to use our invitation service to tell a contact about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your contact's email address or we will ask you to consent to having your contact list(s) imported. We will send your contacts an email in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and we will send additional reminders. nabbesh stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a contact connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have sent and to track the success of our referral program. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own information. nabbesh also stores this information (imported contacts information) to avoid duplication of contacts and to check when contacts, not invited by the User, join the nabbesh Platform through registration. nabbesh will also store the User's access details in order to synch the contacts whenever the User logs in.
			</li><li>When you visit nabbesh, we use a third party tracking partner to gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
			</li><li>In addition, we store certain information from your browser using 'cookies'. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the User's computer tied to information about the User. We send cookies to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use session ID cookies to confirm that Users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the User closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to nabbesh. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature. We use cookies to collect information about visitors' use of the nabbesh website. The information collected by cookies enables nabbesh to understand the use of its site. This in turn helps to provide visitors with a better experience. nabbesh will not attempt to personally identify visitors from their IP addresses. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including storing of User preferences, improving search results and ad selection and tracking User trends, such as how people search. nabbesh also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web.

Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web users.

We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
			</li><li>When you use nabbesh, you may set up your Homepage, form community networks, send messages, perform searches and queries, set up events, add applications, transmit information through various channels and send emails or other communications to nabbesh.
