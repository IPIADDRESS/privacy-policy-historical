    <p align="center"><strong><font size="5">Privacy Policy</font></strong></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the following website: www.naughtyathome.com
      (“Site”). </p>
    <p>We are totally committed to protecting your privacy and security. The
      following information is designed to help you understand how we collect,
      use, disseminate and safeguard the information you provide to us while
      accessing and using our Site. By accessing and using our Site, you signify
      your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our information
      practices, please do not access or use our Site. As provided below, we
      reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, add or remove portions
      of this policy at any time by posting such changes to this page. Such changes
      will be effective upon posting. The Site requests that you read this Privacy
      Policy carefully and consult it regularly. </p>
    <p>Information Collection and Use </p>
    <p>A. Information Collection. When users order our services, the payment
      processor collects information such as names, billing addresses, telephone
      numbers, email addresses, and credit card numbers. We collect information
      from our users when the user signs on to our Birth Date Verifier™ script,
      enters account information, uses our payment processing page, and uses/orders/purchases
      our services. Information is collected through completion of on-line forms
      on the join page and in the online store and sent to our payment processor
      for credit card verification. If a user refuses to provide the required
      information for a specific service, the user will not be able to utilize
      that service. </p>
    <p>B. Information Use. We use information for the following purposes: to
      fulfill your requests for services, to process credit card payments, to
      answer billing questions, to reset user names, and to contact you. We reserve
      the right to use your information for market research data purposes to
      increase the user’s experience according to personal interests and
      to formulate statistical models to accomplish the Site’s goals through
      surveys or contests. We will not sell, share, or rent this information
      to others. </p>
    <p>Registration and Order Forms</p>
    <p>To use, purchase, or order services on our Site, a user must complete
      an on-line form. The form requires a user to provide us (and our payment
      processor) with certain contact information (including, but not limited
      to, your name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address) and
      certain financial information (including your credit card number and the
      expiration date for your credit card). This information is used to purchase
      services, verify credit card details, validate credit identity, and/or
      manage the user’s account. If we have trouble processing an order
      or otherwise need to contact a user, the contact information is used to
      get in touch with the user. From time to time, we may also ask that you
      provide us with additional information so that we can better tailor our
      services to meet your needs. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Cookies</p>
    <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive when
      the user visits certain Web sites and contains information about the user.
      We will not use cookies to collect personal identification information
      from our users. However, we will use cookies and traffic reporting software
      to log referral URL’s and browser preferences. Please note that some
      of our business partners may also use cookies on our Site (for example,
      advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
    <p>Sharing and Third Party Distribution of Information</p>
    <p>We do not currently sell, distribute, or otherwise make available personally
      identifiable information about our users to third parties. Nevertheless,
      we reserve the right to make such information available to third parties
      in the future in order to enhance and personalize our services, or in the
      case of bankruptcy, sale of an asset, business or division, a merger or
      acquisition, or similar change of ownership. This Site also makes chat
      rooms, forums, message boards, clubs, and/or news groups available to our
      users. Please remember that information disclosed in these areas becomes
      public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose
      your personal information. </p>
    <p>Law Enforcement</p>
    <p>We will cooperate with law enforcement authorities, private-party litigants,
      and others seeking information about our end users to the extent required
      by applicable law. Examples of such cooperation include compliance with
      discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders and writs. </p>
    <p>Links</p>
    <p>The Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are
      not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other
      sites. We encourage our users to be aware that when they leave our Site
      they should read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects
      personally identifiable information. </p>
    <p>Security</p>
    <p>We agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the information
      you have provided to us from unauthorized access by using encryption and
      other security measures. All credit information is transmitted via a secured
      server through CCBill for membership purchases. We encourage you to visit
      CCBill’s website and CCBill’s privacy policy regarding its
      privacy policies. Although we take reasonable efforts to make our network
      secure, the Site cannot guarantee that the security measures in place will
      stop third-party “hackers” from illegally accessing your information.
      We encourage you to contact us if you are interested in learning more about
      our security measures. </p>
    <p>Children</p>
    <p>Our Site is not intended for children under the age of 18 or 21, depending
      on the age of majority in your jurisdiction. Our Site does not target children,
      nor do we solicit data, or knowingly collect personally identifiable information
      from them. We encourage parents and legal guardians to spend time online
      with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered
      on the sites their children visit. </p>
    <p>Data Quality, Access, and Updating Personal Information</p>
    <p>The Site will take reasonable steps to ensure that the Site’s information
      and data is complete, accurate, and timely for the user’s desired
      purposes. If a user’s personally identifiable information changes
      (such as phone number or a credit card number), is inaccurate, or if a
      user no longer desires our services, the user should contact us to correct
      or update the information. </p>
    <p>Information Retention</p>
    <p>Our payment processor retains all users’ information in a secure
      database. </p>
    <p>Newsletters, Correspondence, and Opt-out Policy </p>
    <p>We reserve the right to send our users and advertisers e-mail or other
      notices regarding new services, promotions, or other information which
      may be of general interest. Advertisers and users who no longer wish to
      receive materials from us may opt-out of receiving these communications
      by choosing an “unsubscribe” option or by contacting us. We
      will comply will all requests for removal. </p>
    <p>Notification of Changes</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting
      such changes on our Site. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become
      effective upon posting such changes. If you access or use our Site, you
      are required to periodically check our Privacy Policy for any changes.
      If you continue to access or use our Site after we have changed our Privacy
      Policy, you manifest your assent to the changes to our Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p>If we decide to use your personally identifiable information in a manner
      materially different from that stated in the Privacy Policy at the time
      that such information was collected, we will attempt to notify you of such
      changes. You agree that if we send you an e-mail to the e-mail address
      reflected in our records, such e-mail will constitute acceptable notice
      to you of the change in our policy. The notice will provide you with an
      opportunity to “opt-out” so that we may not use your personally
      identifiable information in a manner which is different from the manner
      described at the time that you provided us with such information. If you
      do not affirmatively “opt-out” pursuant to the instructions
      provided to you in the notice, then you agree that we may use your personally
      identifiable information in the manner described in the notice. (If we
      have no e-mail address for you, or if we do not have a current e-mail address
      for you, then you agree that adequate notice of the change in our policy
      will be effected by posting such a change onto our Privacy Policy, which
      shall also disclose information about how you may “opt-out” so
      that we may not use your personally identifiable information in a manner
      which is materially different from the manner described at the time that
      you provided us with such information. If you do not affirmatively “opt-out” pursuant
      to the instructions posted within the time period specified, then you agree
      that we may use your personally identifiable information as described in
      the posted notice). </p>

Irrespective of users’ consent, you must not attempt to disaggregate data that Google reports in aggregate.</p>
    <p>We also encourage you to visit Google Analytics'&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">currently available opt-outs</a>&nbsp;for the web.</p>
