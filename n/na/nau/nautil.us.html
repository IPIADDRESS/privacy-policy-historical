The Type of Information the Service Collects</b></p>

<p>1.&nbsp;
The following Privacy Policy summarizes the
various ways we treat personally identifiable and other information about you
and your computer, mobile or other device when you access, visit and/or use the
Service. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere,
including without limitation offline and on sites, applications, destinations,
or services linked to from the Service, unless specifically provided.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;
The Service generally collects personally
identifiable information with your specific knowledge and consent. For
instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a
purchase, subscribe to our publication(s), register for certain services, or
register and/or set up an account/profile to access, visit and/or use certain
portions of the Service, or the Service as a whole, you may be provided, or
required to choose, a password and/or User ID.&nbsp;
You may also provide your name, telephone number(s), email and/or street
address, and other personally identifiable information. Other information such
as your age, gender, an avatar, and the number for your mobile or other device
may also be requested. In addition, you may be asked to send us similar
information via messaging (e.g., email, SMS, MMS, or other technologies). All
such information will be referred to in this Privacy Policy as "personally
identifiable information."&nbsp; </p>

<p>3.&nbsp;
If you wish to make a purchase at or through the
Service, you may submit credit, debit, or charge card number, or other payment
information.&nbsp; All such information will
be referred to in this Privacy Policy as "payment information."</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;
Our servers may also automatically collect
information about you, your online behavior and your computer, mobile or other
device. The information collected may include, without limitation, the make,
model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser
type, operating system, device identifier) and geographic location of you
and/or your computer, mobile or other device, as well as date/time stamp, IP
address, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, the
site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from,
and other clickstream data.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;
&nbsp;If you
choose to access, visit and/or use any third party social networking service(s)
that may be integrated with the Service, we may receive personally identifiable
information and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other
device that you have made available to those services, including information
about your contacts on those services. For example, some social networking
services allow you to push content from our Service to your contacts or to pull
information about your contacts so you can connect with them on or through our
Service. Some social networking services also will facilitate your registration
for our Service or enhance or personalize your experience on our Service. Your
decision to use a social networking service in connection with our Service is
voluntary. However, you should make sure you are comfortable with the
information your third party social networking services may make available to
our Service by visiting those services' privacy policies and/or modifying your
privacy settings directly with those services. We reserve the right to use,
transfer, assign, sell, share, and provide access to all personally
identifiable information and other information about you and your computer,
mobile or other device that we receive through third-party social networking
services in the same ways described in this Agreement as all of your other
information.</p>

<p><b>2.)<span>&nbsp;
</span>How the Service Uses and Shares Information
About You</b></p>

<p>1.&nbsp;
We use
personally identifiable information you supply through the Service to provide
you with the merchandise, product, service, and/or content you have requested.
For example, if you subscribe to any of our publications, we may use your
e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to
send you the publication. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we
will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We may also use
the information to communicate with you about new features, products or
services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to
your needs.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;
Unless otherwise specified on the Service, we
may sell or share information about you and your computer, mobile or other
device, including without limitation your personally identifiable information,
with our parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates and with carefully selected
companies who we think may offer services and/or products that may be of
interest to you. If you do not wish to receive future commercial messages from
us, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the message you
receive. (But note that you may continue to receive certain communications from
us, such as transactional or relationship messages, and/or messages about your
account/profile). If you've registered on any part of the Service, please use
the mechanism or contact information on the Service that allows you to change
or update your member preferences or information, if available, to keep all
such data accurate and up-to-date. &nbsp;(Please refer to paragraph 8 below.)</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;
We may also allow access to our database by
third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance,
market research, community and forums management, auction services, and
shopping, personal/job search and other classified ads functionality, but only
for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. And
if you choose to purchase merchandise, products and/or services, including
without limitation content, on or through features on the Service, we may
forward your payment information to third parties for services such as credit
card or other payment processing, order fulfillment, credit pre-authorization,
and address verification. There are also times when you provide information
about yourself to us in areas of the Service that may be managed or
participated in by third parties. In such cases, the information may be used by
us and by such third party(ies), each pursuant to its own policies. We may also
provide your personally identifiable information to our advertisers, so that
they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While
we may seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy
policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the
express purpose for which it is provided, we do not bear any responsibility for
any actions or policies of third parties.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;
We reserve the right to access, use, and share
with others your personally identifiable information for purposes of health,
safety and other matters in the public interest.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;
We may also provide access to our database in
order to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings initiated
by governmental and/or law enforcement officials, as well as private parties,
including, for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court
orders, or other legal process.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp;
In addition, we reserve the right to use the
information we collect about your computer, mobile or other device (including
its geographic location), which may at times be able to identify you, for any
lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems
with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, analyze trends,
track users' movements around the Service, and to otherwise administer the
Service. Geographic location information about you and/or your computer, mobile
or other device may specifically be used to show you content and sponsored
messaging based on geographic location.</p>

<p>7.&nbsp;
We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and
share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any lawful
business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible
advertisers, sponsors, clients and customers.</p>

<p>8.&nbsp;
In addition, as our business changes, we may buy
or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or
controlled by us, our parent or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold,
assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the information from
and/or about our Service users may be among the transferred assets.</p>

<p>9.&nbsp;
We reserve the right to identify you from your
personally identifiable information and purchase information and/or to merge or
co-mingle anonymous or non-personally identifiable data about you, your offline
and online behavior, and/or your computer, mobile or other device (including
its geographic location), with your payment information and/or personally
identifiable information,&nbsp; for any lawful
business purpose.</p>

<p><b>3.)<span>&nbsp;
</span>Local Device Storage and Other Tracking
Technologies</b></p>

<p>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Service may
place and/or store code or other types of information and/or devices (e.g.,
"cookies") on your computer, mobile or other device ("Local
Device Storage"). We may use Local Device Storage for any lawful business
purpose, including without limitation to determine which of our messages have
been opened by recipients so we can gauge the effectiveness of marketing campaigns,
to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns, the movements of
individual users, and your geographic location, to help diagnose problems with
our servers, to gather broad demographic information, to analyze trends, to
conduct research, to deliver editorial content, to record registration and
personalization information, and to otherwise administer the Service. For
example, if you register on any part of the Service and are given the option to
save your user name and password, we may provide this convenience to you via
Local Device Storage. Local Device Storage may also collect and store your
personally identifiable information, which may be shared with our parent,
subsidiaries, and affiliates and other companies.</p>

<p>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you do not want
Local Device Storage, your computer, mobile or other device may include an
option that allows you to not accept it. However, if you disable Local Device
Storage, some portions of the Service may not function properly.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;
In addition to Local
Device Storage, we may use web beacons, web bugs, clear gifs, and similar
technologies (collectively, together with Local Device Storage, the
"Tracking Technologies"). We use Tracking Technologies for all or
some of the same lawful business purposes we describe above for use of Local
Device Storage.</p>

<p><b>4.)<span>&nbsp;
</span>Third-Party Tracking Technologies</b></p>

<p>1.&nbsp;
Our advertising
service vendors and other third parties may also use Tracking Technologies to
serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on
this Service and other sites, applications, destinations, and services you have
visited, and to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement
before to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements, and for other lawful
business purposes. In doing so, these third parties may collect non-personally
identifiable data including for example the make, model, settings,
specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating
system, device identifier) and geographic location of your computer, mobile or
other device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of
visits, content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s),
destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data.
The use of Tracking Technologies by third parties is subject to their own
privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy, and we have no responsibility or
liability in connection therewith. </p>

<p><b>5.)&nbsp;
Transfer of Information </b></p>

<p>1.&nbsp;
Your information may be transferred to, and
maintained on, servers and databases located outside of your state, province,
country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as
protective as your jurisdiction. Please be advised that we may transfer your
information to and from any state, province, country or other governmental
jurisdiction, and process it in the United States or elsewhere. </p>

<p>2.&nbsp;
The Service is intended for citizens of the
United States.&nbsp; Nautilus makes no
representation that the contents of this Privacy Policy comply with the laws of
countries other than the United States of America.&nbsp; Those who choose to access the Service from
locations outside the United States do so at their own risk and are responsible
for compliance with all applicable laws.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><b>6.)<span>&nbsp;
</span>Information Security and Notification</b></p>

<p>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Because no data
transmission is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic
security is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of the information
you send to us or the security of our servers, networks or databases. By using
the Service you agree that we are not responsible for any inadvertent loss of
such information or the consequences thereof.</p>

<p>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you elect to
store information, such as your personally identifiable information or payment
information, where others may access it, we are not responsible for any loss of
such information or the consequences thereof. If you lose a computer, mobile or
other device, or it is stolen, that contains your personally identifiable
information or payment information, it is up to you to take all the steps
necessary to protect yourself.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;
In the unlikely
event that we believe the security of any of your information in our possession
or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If
notification is appropriate, we may notify you via your computer, mobile or
other device.</p>

<p><b>7.)&nbsp;
Kids and Parents</b></p>

<p>1.&nbsp;
This Service is not intended for use by
children, especially those under the age of 13. No one under age 13 is allowed
to register for the Service or provide any personally identifiable information
or use our social, community, and public discussion areas; photo and video
galleries; bulletin boards; forums; chats; blogs; personal/job search and other
classified ads; and elsewhere. Minors between the ages of 13 and 17, inclusive,
must get the permission of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) before making
purchases, including subscriptions, on this Service.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;
If your children disclose information about
themselves in publicly accessible areas of the Service, they may get
unsolicited messages from other parties. Therefore, you should tell them not to
do so.</p>

<p><b>8.)<span>&nbsp;
</span>Your access to your personally identifiable
information</b></p>

<p>1.&nbsp;
If you would like to know whether the Service
has collected personally identifiable information about you, please send the
Service the activities that you participated in at the Website which requested
personally identifiable information and after reviewing the relevant databases,
the Service will confirm whether it has collected such information about you.
You may review personally identifiable information about you in the the Service
records at any time provided you first give the Service proof of your identity,
such as by accurately stating a password. The Service will change any
inaccuracies in the personally identifiable information that pertains to you in
response to a reasonable request, and/or end any direct communications with
you, or even delete your personally identifiable information altogether, except
to the extent the Service is required to do otherwise under law. To convey any
such request, contact <a href="mailto:john.steele@nautil.us">john.steele@nautil.us</a>
and please put “privacy policy” in the subject heading.</p>

<p><b>9.)&nbsp;
Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p>

<p>1.&nbsp;
By accessing the Service, you agree to be bound
by this Privacy Policy (as well as the other parts of the Terms of Use).</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;
We reserve the right to change this Privacy
Policy from time to time, in which case we will post the revised Privacy Policy
on the Service.&nbsp; By continuing to use the
Service after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as
modified.</p>
