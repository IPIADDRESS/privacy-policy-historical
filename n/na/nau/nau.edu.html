				<p>NAU provides online information and services to students, employees 
				and the public to supplement services provided on campus. This privacy 
				statement provides information about privacy, confidentiality and 
				related policies for individuals who use our websites and online 
				services. Individual websites may provide additional information 
				about privacy. Additional information about the use of computing 
				and communications systems at NAU is available at
				<a href="http://www.nau.edu/stc/policies/student_aup.htm">http://www.nau.edu/stc/policies/student_aup.htm</a> 
				for students, and for employees at
				<a href="http://www.nau.edu/its/policies/#networkuse">http://www.nau.edu/its/policies/#networkuse</a>. 
				The NAU website contains links to external websites. NAU is not 
				responsible for the privacy practices or policies of those sites 
				not hosted on official NAU servers.</p>

				<p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY NAU<br>
				</strong>In addition to information actively provided by individuals 
				using NAU websites, the NAU web servers routinely record the following 
				information each time the sites are used:</p>
				<ul>
								<li>Internet address of the computer being used
								</li>
								<li>Web pages requested </li>
								<li>Network software access </li>

								<li>Referring web page </li>
								<li>Browser used </li>
								<li>Date, time and duration of activity </li>
								<li>Accounts accessed; date and time of a password 
								change </li>
								<li>Volume of data storage and transfers </li>
								<li>Server space used for e-mail. </li>

				</ul>
				<p>NAU uses this information to monitor and preserve the functioning 
				and integrity of the system.</p>
				<p>In cases of suspected violations of NAU policies, especially 
				unauthorized access to computing systems, the system administrator 
				concerned may authorize detailed session logging. This may involve 
				capturing and retaining a complete keystroke log of an entire session. 
				In addition, a system administrator for the equipment involved may 
				authorize limited searching of user files on individual or networked 
				computers to gather evidence on a suspected violation. All system 
				administrators are required to report such logging to their supervisors 
				to assure proper university guidelines for system and network administration 
				are being followed.</p>
				<p>Cookies are short pieces of information used by web browsers 
				to remember information provided by the user, such as passwords 
				and preferences from past visits. Additional information on cookies 
				is available at the Cookie Central web site at
				<a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">http://www.cookiecentral.com</a>. 
				Some NAU websites, such as the LOUIE online registration system, 
				use cookies to store service information. Some NAU web-based services 
				require cookies for access.</p>
				<p><strong>ALTERNATIVES TO WEBSITE TRANSACTIONS</strong><br>
				NAU websites provide access to information and services for students, 
				employees and members of the public. If you prefer not to provide 
				any information to the university online, you may cancel the transaction 
				and contact the administrative unit responsible for the service 
				to learn about available options for conducting business in person, 
				by mail or by telephone.</p>

				<p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong><br>
				NAU does not sell or distribute confidential information it collects 
				online to individuals or entities not affiliated with the university, 
				except in the very limited circumstances described below. Non-confidential 
				information may be sold or distributed pursuant to Arizona Public 
				Records law.</p>
				<p>University and Arizona Board of Regents policies protect the 
				confidentiality of student educational records and personnel information. 
				These policies, summarized below, explain what information may be 
				shared with the public or anyone who requests it. They also explain 
				what information is protected as confidential; confidential information 
				will not be disclosed without the consent of the student or employee, 
				except under subpoena or court order or in case of an emergency.</p>
				<p><strong>STUDENT RECORDS</strong><br>
				Student records are protected by the federal Family Educational 
				Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), Arizona law, and university policy. 
				Information about student access to education records and protection 
				of education records is available at 
				<a href="http://home.nau.edu/enrollmentservices/ferpa.asp">
				http://home.nau.edu/enrollmentservices/ferpa.asp</a>. 
				This policy also provides information on a student's right to limit 
				access to otherwise public directory information Chat rooms, forums, 
				message boards, and news groups. NAU may retain logs and copies 
				of chat room sessions for various courses. Normal, non-class news 
				group postings or other forums are operated without archives but 
				are subject to the backup policies on the machine hosting the service. 
				Some class materials are treated as confidential educational records. 
				Other class materials are available to the public in general (many 
				course syllabi and most usenet news course discussions, for example).</p>

				<p><strong>EMPLOYEE RECORDS</strong><br>
				Employee records are controlled by Arizona Board of Regents policy 
				6-912 and by NAU Personnel policy 4.11, which is contained in the 
				Personnel Policy Manual:
				<a href="http://hr.nau.edu/m/images/stories/docs/policy_manual.pdf">
				http://hr.nau.edu/m/images/stories/docs/policy_manual.pdf</a>.</p>
				<p><strong>PUBLIC RECORDS LAW</strong><br>
				Under the Arizona Public Records Law, NAU may be required to provide 
				information in university records to a third party. Commercial users 
				may purchase public record information, such as non-confidential 
				lists of students and employees. Confidential information protected 
				by FERPA, other state laws or Board policy will not be disclosed 
				in response to a public records request. </p>
				<p><strong>CONTRACTORS</strong><br>

				From time to time, individuals or companies under contract with 
				the university may have access to confidential information in the 
				course of the service they provide to the university, but those 
				entities are not permitted to use or re-disclose that information 
				for unauthorized purposes. No other entities are authorized to collect 
				information through NAU's sites.</p>
				<p><strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
				Although every effort is made to secure network communications, 
				NAU cannot ensure the privacy of online communications. Individuals 
				using online services should also take steps to protect personal 
				information, such as closing the web browser when finished using 
				the site. Failure to do so may result in personal information being 
				viewed by someone else using the same computer. In general, using 
				a browser in a public area (such as a CyberCafe) may leave history 
				and cache files on the machine that others can abuse.</p>
				<p>NAU accepts credit card payments online for a variety of goods 
				and services. Unless otherwise noted on the site, all university 
				credit card transactions are encrypted. Confidential information 
				entered to complete a transaction will not be used by NAU for any 
				other purpose unless the purpose is described on the site.</p>
				<p>Under NAU policy, university-owned computers and equipment may 
				be examined by authorized individuals to detect illegal software 
				and to evaluate the security of the network. Personal computers 
				connected to NAU's network are also subject to NAU's campus acceptable 
				use policies.</p>

				<p>If you have additional questions about online privacy or security, 
				you can send an e-mail to the NAU Chief Information Technology Officer, 
				Fred Estrella, at Fred.Estrella@nau.edu, you can phone Fred Estrella 
				at 928-523-9998, or you can send an inquiry by mail to Chief Information 
				Technology Officer, Northern Arizona University, PO Box 5100, Flagstaff, 
				AZ, 86011-5100.</p>
