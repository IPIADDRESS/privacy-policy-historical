			<h2>Naughty Dating USA Member Privacy Policy</h2>
			
	<p>
		<em>
			Last updated on Tuesday, December 3rd,
			2013
		</em>
	</p>

	<h3>Proprietor</h3>
	
	<p>The owner and operator of the Naughty Dating USA website at http://www.naughtydatingusa.com (the "Website")
	and the dating and networking service offered via the Website (the
	"Service") is White Label Dating Incorporated, a
	corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, whose
	registered office is 425 Boylston Street, Third Floor, Boston, MA
	02116 ("we," "us," "our" or "White
	Label"). White Label can be contacted via the contact section on
	the Website or by writing to our registered address.</p>
	
	<p>White Label
	respects the privacy of each user accessing the Website (each a
	"User") and is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
	Policy explains how White Label handles and protects personally
	identifiable information received from Users, and what Users can do
	to help protect that information.</p>
	
	<h3>Submission and Processing of Information</h3>
	
	<p>When you subscribe or sign up to the Website and/or the Service, White Label
	may ask you for certain personally identifiable information.  This
	personally identifiable information may include information that can
	be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, email address,
	mailing address and telephone number ("Personal Information").
	</p>
	
	<p>If a User elects to subscribe for the Service or access one of our other
	fee-based services, the Personal Information of that User may also
	include certain financial information such as debit or credit card
	information provided by that User.  By making a purchase, or engaging
	in any other kind of activity or transaction that uses financial
	information on the Website, you consent to our providing your
	financial information to our service providers and to such third
	parties as we determine necessary to support and process your
	activities and transactions, as well as to your debit or credit card
	issuer for their purposes.  These third parties may include the
	debit/credit card companies, data processing companies and banking
	institutions used to process and support your transaction or
	activity.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, the Website automatically collects anonymous information
	about Users.  For example, the Website automatically gathers a User's
	Internet Protocol address, which Internet Service Provider the User
	utilizes, statistics about how Users navigate through and use the
	Website, and information gathered through the use of a device known
	as a "cookie". Cookies are small pieces of removable data that
	are stored by the web browser on your computer, mobile phone or other
	device that identifies your computer, mobile phone or other device
	when you visit the Website.  We use cookies to improve the Website
	and the services available to you.</p>
	
	<p>Cookies enable us:</p>
	<ul class="bulleted">
		<li>To estimate our audience size and usage pattern;</li>
		<li>To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise the Website according to your individual interests;</li>
		<li>To speed up your searches; and</li>
		<li>To recognize you when you return to our Website.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The Company also compiles statistics that track the usage of the Website.
	 These statistics are used for internal purposes only and contain no
	Personal Information.</p>
	
	<h3>User Postings</h3>
	<p>
	Except
	as otherwise expressly described in this Privacy Policy, this policy
	only addresses the use and disclosure of Personal Information and
	other information we collect from you.</p>
	
	<p> In the course of your use of the Website or Service, including
	when you create a profile on the Website, you may
	elect to post or otherwise disclose information about yourself and
	others, which may include Personal Information or other personally
	identifiable information.  You may also elect to communicate with
	others or upload content such as photographs.  Such postings are
	governed by our Terms of Use.  Whenever you voluntarily disclose
	personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information
	will be publicly available and can be collected or used by others. 
	Such postings may also appear on other websites or when searches are
	executed on the subject of your posting.</p>
	
	<p>Furthermore,
	although White Label restricts access to portions of the Website to
	members of the Service, since the
	Service is offered through and accessible through a number of other
	websites in addition to the Website, any information that you
	post to the Website for access by members of the Website may be
	searchable and available to users of the Service who access it via
	different websites from the Website.</p>
	
	<p>You may also receive unsolicited messages from other parties as a result
	of such disclosure.</p>
	
	<p>Such activities are beyond the control of White Label and this Privacy
	Policy.  You should therefore exercise discretion and extreme caution
	when disclosing any Personal Information or other information when
	using the Website or the Service.</p>
	
	<h3>Third Party Websites</h3>
	
	<p>The Website contains links to other websites.  White Label is not responsible for
	the privacy practices of such websites.  It
	is the User's responsibility to review the privacy policies at
	those websites to confirm that they
	are acceptable prior to use.  A
	link does not constitute an endorsement of the content, viewpoint or
	accuracy of such websites.</p>
	
	<h3>Marketing Communications</h3>
	
	<p>If you have used the Website before, it is possible that White Label has data
	about you already and it is being used to contact you about offers,
	events, items or related activities. If you are an existing customer,
	White Label will continue to keep you informed unless you revoke your
	consent via the procedures set forth below.</p>
	
	<p>If you are a new customer, White Label will give you the choice (for example,
	once you have subscribed or signed up) whether or not you want to
	receive emails regarding future offers, events and new services or
	related activities. White Label will not bombard you with emails, but
	White Label, with your consent, would like to keep you informed of
	any developments on the Website.</p>
	
	<p>White Label does not sell, trade or rent Personal Information of Users to
	other companies and partners but from time to time may want to share
	Personal
	Information (other than credit card information) of any User with
	affiliates of White Label and with other carefully selected companies
	that White Label believes offer services and products that would
	potentially be of interest to that User.  In no event will the
	Company share any credit card information of any User.  
	</p>
	
	<p>White Label will not send you any marketing emails or share your Personal
	Information with third parties for marketing purposes unless you give
	your consent or you have given it already. If you wish to receive
	this information, on the "My Settings" page please select
	"On" next to the option to receive "Relevant
	information from White Label and selected third parties" and
	click the "Save my settings" button.  If you have consented
	to receive such information, you may always revoke that consent at
	any time by changing your settings at the Website or exercising the
	"unsubscribe" option in any emails you get from us or from our
	marketing partners.</p>
	
	<h3>Confidentiality and Security of Personal Information</h3>
	
	<p>Transmission of data and information via the Website is not a secure or encrypted
	transmission method for sending your Personal Information, unless
	otherwise indicated on the Website. Accordingly, your attention is
	drawn to the fact that any information and personal data carried over
	the Internet is not secure. Personal Information may be intercepted,
	lost, redirected, corrupted, changed and accessed by other people.</p>
	
	<p>Nevertheless, White Label is committed to using all reasonable efforts to protect
	Personal Information collected through the Website against
	unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  Consequently, we limit
	employees' access to Personal Information collected through the
	Website to only those employees who need access to the information in
	the performance of their official duties.  Employees who have access
	to this information are required to follow appropriate procedures in
	connection with any disclosures of Personal Information.   
	</p>
	
	<p>The Company protects any debit or credit card information provided by the
	User by revealing only the last four digits of a User's
	debit/credit card number when confirming a subscription or order, but
	is required to transmit the entire debit/credit card number to its
	debit/credit card processor during processing.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, we set strict security standards to prevent any
	unauthorized access to your Personal Information once we have
	received it and wherever possible we will use adequate security
	software and working procedures to ensure the security of your
	personal data. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy, and
	ensure proper use of Personal Information, we have employed physical,
	electronic,
	and managerial processes to safeguard and secure the Personal
	Information we collect online.
	These measures include limiting the number of people who have
	physical access to White Label' database servers, as well as
	electronic security systems and password protections which guard
	against unauthorized access.</p>
	<p>
		
	</p><h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
	
	<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to any member of our group, which
	means our subsidiaries and our ultimate holding company and its
	subsidiaries.</p>
	
	<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties if you have
	consented to such disclosure. In addition, we may disclose or provide
	access to your Personal Information to third parties without your
	consent:</p>
	
	<ul class="bulleted">
		<li>if we sell
		or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your
		Personal Information to the prospective seller or buyer of such
		business or assets;</li>
		
		<li>
		if White
		Label or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third
		party, in which case Personal Information held by it about its
		customers will, in most instances, be one of the transferred assets;</li>
		
		<li>if we ask
		a third party to carry out data analysis, cleansing and/or market
		research on our behalf;</li>
			
		<li>for the
		purpose of validating the identity of the user and/or conducting
		background checks; or</li>
		
		<li>
		if we have
		a good faith belief that we are under a duty to disclose or share
		your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation
		(such as in connection with a law enforcement request, judicial
		proceeding, court order or legal process), or in order to enforce or
		apply our <a href="/help/terms.cfm">Terms
		of Use</a>,
		or to protect the rights, property, or safety of White Label, our
		customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with
		other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud
		protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Changes to Personal Information</h3>
	
	<p>It is both in our interest and yours to store and process accurate Personal
	Information. If the Personal Information we hold about you is
	inaccurate in any way, where appropriate, you may have your Personal
	Information corrected by us on request.  Please contact us to update
	any of your Personal Information by addressing the "Information
	Officer" via email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ussupport@whitelabeldating.com">ussupport@whitelabeldating.com</a></p>
	
	<h3>Children's Online Privacy</h3>
	
	<p>It is important to White Label that parents and guardians have control over
	what information is collected from their children online and how such
	information is or may be used.  The Children's Online Privacy
	Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA") imposes restrictions on
	commercial websites, including ours.  It is our policy to be
	compliant with the requirements of COPPA and not to solicit or
	collect information about or from children age 13 and under.</p>
	
	<p>
	Beyond the requirements of COPPA, we require that individuals be age 18 or over
	to register as a member of the Service and thus it is our policy not
	to solicit or collect information about or from anyone under the age
	of 18. Users are cautioned, however, that absent a clear indication an
	online communication has been submitted by a person under age 18, the
	collection of Personal Information submitted to the Website will be
	treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless
	exempted from access by federal or state law, be subject to public
	access.</p>
	
	<p>In the event that White Label receives an online communication clearly
	indicating that it has been submitted by a person under the age of
	18, under no circumstances will any Personal Information be published
	on the Website, be used for a purpose not intended by its sender or
	shared with third parties.</p>
	
	<p> If you would like more information about COPPA, please visit the Federal
	Trade Commission's official COPPA page at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">www.ftc.gov</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy and Transfers of Ownership</h3>
	
	<p>You agree that if we transfer ownership or management of the Website or White
	Label to a third party we may also transfer your Personal Information
	and any other data or information you have provided to us to such
	third party, provided such third party agrees to observe this Privacy
	Policy.</p>
	
	<p>White Label may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to accurately
	reflect how we gather and manage User information.  We will post any
	changes to this Privacy Policy on the Website and, where appropriate
	and practicable, notify you by e-mail. All changes to the Privacy
	Policy will be effective upon posting to the Website.  Please be sure
	to regularly check our Privacy Policy before using the Website. 
	Continued use of the Website shall indicate your acceptance of any
	changes to this Privacy Policy</p>
	
	<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
	<p>The information provided in this Privacy Policy should not be construed
	as giving business, legal or other advice, or warranting as fail
	proof the integrity and security of information provided through this
	Website.  While all reasonable attempts are made to provide accurate,
	current and reliable information, White Label recognizes the
	possibility of human and/or mechanical error and the possibility that
	Users of the Site and other third parties may provide and/or publish
	information, graphics and images on the Site that are false,
	misleading, or inaccurate.  Therefore, White Label makes no
	representations as to the accuracy, completeness, currency or
	suitability of the information provided on this Website, and denies
	any expressed or implied warranty as to the same.  For further
	disclaimers and limitations of liability of White Label regarding
	your use of the Website and Service, see its Terms of Use. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>
	
	<p>Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents
	are entitled to ask White Label for a notice describing what
	categories of personal customer information we share with third
	parties or affiliates for those third parties' or affiliates'
	direct marketing purposes.  That notice will identify the categories
	of information shared and will include a list of the third parties
	and affiliates with whom it was shared, along with their names and
	addresses.  If you are a California resident and would like a copy of
	this notice, please submit a written request by addressing the
	"Information Officer" via email
	at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ussupport@whitelabeldating.com">ussupport@whitelabeldating.com</a>.
	 Please note that it may take up to 60 days from receipt of your
	email to receive this notice.</p>
	
	<h3>Further Information</h3>
