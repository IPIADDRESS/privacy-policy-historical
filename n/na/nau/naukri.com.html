Each cookie falls within one of the four following categories: <br><br> <table> <thead style="font-weight:bold; background-color: #d8d8d8;"> <tr style="height: 30px;"> <th>Category</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="width: 150px">Essential Cookies</td> <td>Essential cookies (First Party Cookies) are sometimes called "strictly necessary" as without them we cannot provide many services that you need on the Website. For example, essential cookies help remember your preferences as you move around the Website. Essential cookies also keep you logged in into a website. Without them the login functionality would not work.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Analytics Cookies</td> <td>These cookies track information about visits to the Naukri.com and partner (recruiter websites) websites so that we can make improvements and report our performance. For example: analyse visitor and user behaviour so as to provide more relevant content or suggest certain activities.

Such cookies help generate statistics and reports about visitors and their activities on the website or app.<br><br> <b>e. How cookies are used for online analytics purposes?</b> <br><br> We may use web analytics services on Naukri.com, such as those of Google Analytics.

These cookies allow our partners to recognize your computer so that the ad server can show you Naukri.com advertisements elsewhere on the Internet, and so that our analytics software can measure your engagement and interactions while using Naukri.com services. In this way, ad servers may compile anonymous, de-identified information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw our advertisements, whether or not you interacted with our advertisements, and actions performed on subsequent visits to Naukri.com websites and applications. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you, and it allows Naukri.com to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns and the usability of our website. In other words, we use analytics data in concert with data about our online ads that have been shown using the Google Display Network, Facebook for Advertisers, or other online advertising networks.

The social networks, such as Facebook, Google, etc. may themselves also put cookies on your machine. If a user logs into Facebook, Twitter or Google+ via our website, they will leave a cookie on the users' computer. This is the same process as if the user logs into these social networks directly. <br><br> We also use Google Analytics on our Services to help us analyse how our Services are used.

What are Web Beacons?</b> <br><br> Naukri.com occasionally advertises on third party websites. As part of our effort to track the success of our advertising campaigns, we may at times use a visitor identification technology such as "web beacons," or "action tags," which count visitors who have come to our site after being exposed to a Naukri.com banner ad on a third party site. Our partners may also use web beacons to collect data in the aggregate as provided by your browser while you are on our site or another site where Naukri.com is third party. <br><br> By navigating on our site, you agree that we can place cookie and web beacons on your computer or device. If you prefer not to receive web beacons, then you should stop using our site, or consult your browsing settings. <br><br> <b>i. How to control cookies?</b> <br><br> Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you choose to turn off these cookies, you will still see advertising on the internet but it may not be tailored to your interests. It does not mean that you won't be served any advertisements whilst you are online. Whilst we have mentioned most of the third parties involved in using targeting or advertising cookies in the preceding section , the list is not exhaustive and is subject to change. Therefore, even if you choose to turn off all the third-party cookies listed in section , you may still receive some tailored advertisements and recommendations. <br><br> There are a number of ways you can manage what cookies are set on your devices. Essential cookies, however, cannot be disabled. If you do not allow certain cookies to be installed, the website may not be accessible to you and/or the performance, features, or services of the website may be compromised. <br><br> You can also manage this type of cookie in the privacy settings on the web browser you are using.
