            this privacy policy applies to Boathook.com, and all of the other 
            Internet-accessible Boathook.com-branded services, we will refer here 
            only to Boathook.com to make reading this policy easier. The purpose 
            of this Boathook.com privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome 
            visitor to Boathook.com, what kinds of information we may gather about 
            you when you visit Boathook.com, how we may use that information, 
            whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding 
            our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Finally, 
            please note that this policy applies only to Boathook.com and websites 
            that carry the Boathook.com brand, and not to the websites of other

            data will be collected, processed and used by Boathook.com and its 
            affiliated companies for the purpose of providing the Boathook.com 
            service and related services to you. Boaternet is an international 
            internet business, and many of the computer systems that provide it 
            are currently based in the United Kingdom and also the United States.

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066"><b>Information 
            about all Boathook.com visitors</b><br>
            In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information 
            like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Boathook.com and its 
            areas. This information is very much like television ratings that 
            tell the television networks how many people tuned in to a programme. 
            We only use such data in aggregate form. This collective data helps 
            us determine how much our customers use specific parts of our site, 
            so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we 
            can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, Boathook.com 
            uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how 
            and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. Boathook.com 
            cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we 
            do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally 
            identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your 
            screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide statistical 
            "ratings" information, but never information which could 
            identify you personally, to our Boathook.com partners about how our 
            members, collectively, use Boathook.com. We do this so they too can 
            understand how much people use their areas and our site in order for 
            them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066"><b>Information 
            about you</b><br>
            Sometimes, we may specifically ask you for information about you when 
            you sign up to use a service, or when you order a product. We will 
            need certain information -- such as your name, Internet address or 
            user name, billing address, credit card number -- in order to provide 
            that service or product to you. We may also use that information to 
            let you know of additional products and services about which you might 
            be interested. You can easily choose not to receive such information 
            if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen 
            when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you for information 
            about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of 
            the interactivity of the online medium, but the provision of such 
            information is always optional. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066"><b>Disclosure</b><br>
            We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits 
            to Boathook.com or information that you may give us, such as your 
            name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies. 
            But as we mention above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated 
            statistical "ratings" information about the use of Boathook.com.

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066"><b>Special 
            attention to children</b><br>
            Boathook.com takes special care to protect the safety and privacy 
            of young people using our services. We do not specifically collect 
            information about children and believe that children should get their 
            parents' consent before giving out any personal information. We encourage 
            you to participate in your child's online experience and to review 
            our important safety tips before your child explores the Internet.
