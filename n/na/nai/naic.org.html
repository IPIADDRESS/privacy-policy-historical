	    <b>NAIC Privacy Statement</b></h1>
      <p>Welcome to 
        the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") 
        Web Site. Because your privacy on-line is very important to us, we want 
        you to understand the NAIC’s practices with regard to collecting and using 
        your information. This privacy statement explains the privacy practices 
        for the following NAIC Web Sites: <a href="http://www.naic.org">www.naic.org;</a> 
        <a href="http://www.serff.com">www.serff.com</a> <a href="http://www.carfra.org/">www.carfra.org</a>. 
        The NAIC’s Privacy Statement is not intended to supercede or modify the 
        terms of any license agreement between NAIC and a third party and where 
        inconsistent, the terms of the license agreement control.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">	    <b><i>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Information<br>
        </i></b>You do not need to reveal any personally 
        identifiable information to browse the NAIC Web Sites.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
	    <b><i>Customer Information<br>
        </i></b>If you order an NAIC product or register for an education or training course 
		or a meeting online, the NAIC collects your name, address, telephone number, e-mail 
		address, company name, and company size. The NAIC collects this information for 
		purposes of fulfilling orders for products, registering for courses and NAIC meetings, 
		and billing. The NAIC may also use this information to create general mailing lists 
        to send customers marketing and other promotional material. The NAIC also 
        collects credit card information if you are making an online purchase. 
        The NAIC uses this information for billing purposes only.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If 
        you subscribe or utilize an NAIC online service including the I-SITE System 
        (accessible only by State Insurance Departments); the Automated Valuation 
        System; the ATF and the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing, the 
        NAIC collects your name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, 
        and e-mail address. The NAIC collects this information for the following 
        purposes: problem resolution, security/authentication, aggregate usage 
        reports. The NAIC may also use this information to create general mailing 
        lists to send user notices as well as marketing and other relevant information 
        to customers.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The 
        NAIC collects and stores the Internet protocol (the IP address) of the 
        computer you are using, and the date and time you accessed the NAIC site. 
        The NAIC also tracks the pages or documents accessed within its site. 
        This information is collected for systems administration and for analyzing 
        and improving the value of the material available on the NAIC Web Sites.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The 
        main NAIC Web Site is portal based and relies upon "cookies" to tailor the information delivered to the user. Cookies are small web-generated 
        files that are stored on your computer hard drive in order to collect 
        information about your activities on a particular web site. The NAIC utilizes 
        cookies to monitor security, navigation and usage of the NAIC Web Sites.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The 
        NAIC uses information collected over the Internet to process your requests, 
        communicate back to you and improve our web sites. The NAIC may share 
        the information mentioned above with its non-profit affiliate the National 
        Insurance Producer Registry ("NIPR") for these purposes. The 
        NAIC does not provide customer information collected over the Internet 
        to third parties other than in aggregated form.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <b><i>Information 
        Submitted in an Online Application<br>
        </i></b>Certain NAIC online applications collect 
        information for purposes of transmitting the information to state insurance 
        departments (e.g., SERFF) and/or processing the information for the user 
        (e.g. AVS). These online applications require the user to enter into a 
        license agreement with the NAIC. The license agreement governs the collection, 
        use and disclosure of information while in these applications and where 
        the terms of this Privacy Statement are inconsistent, the license agreement 
        supercedes.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Insurance 
        companies electronically file annual and quarterly statements as well 
        as other filing information with the NAIC. The NAIC compiles this information 
        into a proprietary database for purposes of assisting its members, state 
        insurance regulators, in carrying out their respective regulatory functions. 
        The NAIC also sells non-confidential information from this proprietary 
        database to customers subject to a license agreement.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <b><i>Security 
        of Information<br>
        </i></b>The NAIC views security of confidential 
        and private information as a top priority. The NAIC provides secure transmission 
        of sensitive and personal information from your computers to the NAIC’s 
        Web Servers. For instance, when credit card information is transmitted, 
        the NAIC uses the industry standard SSL (security socket layer) encryption. 
        SSL encryption is a state-of-the-art technology by which information is 
        encrypted while being transmitted over the Internet. Unfortunately, no 
        data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely 
        secure and the NAIC does not ensure or warrant the security of the transmission 
        of information. Once the information is received by the NAIC via the web 
        site, it is stored behind a firewall. The NAIC also maintains access control 
        procedures. All NAIC and NIPR employees are aware of the privacy and security 
        policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who have 
        a legitimate need for the information in order to perform their jobs.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <b><i>Correction 
        and Opt-Out Procedures<br>
        </i></b>If your personally identifiable customer 
        information changes, we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the 
        personal data provided to us. Please visit the Web page <a href="http://www.naic.org/about/contacts.htm">www.naic.org/about/contacts.htm</a> 
        to find the contact information or send your request for change to the 
        Help Desk at <a href="mailto:help@naic.org">help@naic.org</a>. If you 
        no longer wish to receive NAIC newsletters, promotional materials or other 
        electronic communications, you may opt-out by replying to the NAIC e-mail 
        and inserting the term "unsubscribe" in the subject line or 
        by sending an e-mail to the Help Desk at <a href="mailto:help@naic.org">help@naic.org</a></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <b><i>Links 
        to Other Web Sites<br>
        </i></b>The NAIC provides links to third-party web 
        sites as a convenience to its users. The inclusion of any link does not 
        imply an endorsement or recommendation of the third-party organization, 
        its web site, or its products and services. The NAIC has not reviewed 
        and is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such web 
        sites.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <b><i>Notification 
        of Change<br>
        </i></b>The NAIC reserves the right to change its 
        privacy policy. The most current privacy policy will be posted on the 
        NAIC Web Sites so you are always aware of what information the NAIC collects, 
        how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. 
        If at any point the NAIC decides to use personally identifiable information 
        in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, the 
        NAIC will notify users by way of an e-mail. The NAIC will provide a method 
        for a user to opt-out of using their information in this different manner.</p>
