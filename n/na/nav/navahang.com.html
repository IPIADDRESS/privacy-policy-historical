<span style="color: #ffffff;">This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the Navahang LLC End User License Agreement and Terms of Service located at&nbsp;https://www.navahang.com/privacy/&nbsp;(“<strong>EULA</strong>”). The terms “<strong>Navahang,</strong>” “<strong>we,</strong>” “<strong>us,</strong>” and “<strong>our</strong>” include NAVAHANG, LLC and its affiliates and/or subsidiaries. All other terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meanings set forth in the EULA.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">This Privacy Policy explains how NAVAHANG may collect, use, process, disclose and safeguard information we obtain through the Service, including our website (currently at&nbsp;<a href="https://tunein.com/">www.NAVAHANG.com</a>) and our mobile applications, and in connection with our partner and vendor relationships. It also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your Personal Information, and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>HOW NAVAHANG COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. We obtain Personal Information relating to you from various sources as described below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Information, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Information when requested, you may not be able to benefit from our Service if that information is necessary to provide you with the Service or if we are legally required to collect it.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Personal Information Obtained from Third Parties</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Social Sign-on.</strong>&nbsp;We collect information from social media services when you use your credentials for these services to log into the Service.

We may also obtain other non-public information with your permission.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Other Third Parties.</strong>&nbsp;We may collect information about you from other third parties, such as other users or our marketing partners. For example, we may receive information about you when another user allows us to upload your contact information to the Service. We may combine this information with the other information we collect about you.</span></p>
