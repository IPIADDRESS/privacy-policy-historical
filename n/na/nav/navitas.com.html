<h2>Overview</h2>
</div>
<p>Navitas Limited (Navitas) is subject to the Australian Privacy Act 1998.</p>
<p>This Act gives people some control over the personal information they provide to an agency and the right to know how it will be used.</p>
<p>This Web Privacy Statement outlines how Navitas deals with personal information related to our website. Users of our website are entitled to expect that any information collected will be treated within the terms of the Australian privacy responsibilities and obligations.</p>
<div class="title_split">
<h2>What is personal information?</h2>
</div>
<p>Personal information includes any information or opinion about an individual whose identity is apparent or can be readily identified from the information or opinion. For further information visit the Office of the Privacy Commissioner website.</p>
<div class="title_split">
<h2>What information do we collect automatically?</h2>
</div>
<p>When you look at Navitas website, our computers record your visit and log the following information for statistical purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the Internet Protocol address from which we receive the request</li>
    <li>the date and time our server received the request</li>
    <li>the pages, documents and files you requested</li>
    <li>the address of the resource which provided the link followed, if any, to Navitas website</li>
    <li>the type of browser and, in some cases, the operating system used</li>
    <li>in some cases, data you send to our website from web forms (e.g. search terms).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some sections of Navitas website use standard industry technologies, for example 'cookies', to make full use of the site.</p>
<div class="title_split">
<h2>What do we do with the information?</h2>
</div>
<p>The anonymous information collected during each request is collated for analysis. It is then evaluated and published in reports that show Navitas usage patterns and identify popular areas of the website. This helps us to improve and develop the website and its services.</p>
<p>For security reasons, Navitas uses software programs to monitor network traffic and identify unauthorised attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.</p>
<div class="title_split">
<h2>What won't we do with the information?</h2>
</div>
<p>Navitas will not disclose or externally publish personal information without consent.</p>
<p>No attempt will be made to identify individual users or their browsing activities except for when, in the unlikely event of an investigation, a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect Navitas logs.</p>
<p>Apart from an occasion when it may be required to do so by law, Navitas will not disclose your personal information to a third party unless you have authorised it to do so.</p>

    <li>unauthorised attempts by other websites to index the contents of Navitas website</li>
