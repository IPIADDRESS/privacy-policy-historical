<h4>We use Web-server activity logs to handle the information we gather when you visit our Web site.</h4>

<p>
As part of the normal operation of our Web server, certain information
is automatically and continuously collected and stored in "access"
and "referrer" log files. The information collected
includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, "aol.com" 
    if you are connecting from an America Online account, or "howard.edu" 
    if you are connecting from Howard University's domain), 
  </li><li>the type of Web browser you use to view our site,
  </li><li>the type of transaction you engage in (i.e., database query,
  data download, page or image retrieval),
  </li><li>the date and time you access our site,
  </li><li>the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked
  directly to our site,
  </li><li>your computer operating system, and 
  </li><li>the browser you use when you visit nationalatlas.gov.

</li></ul>

<p>These data are periodically summarized and analyzed 
to study site usage over time and to perform other studies to
help us improve the site's organization, performance, and usefulness.</p>

<p><b><br>
Electronic mail</b><br>
When you send us personally identifying information by e-mail (that is, 
in a message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a form 
that e-mails us this information), we use it to respond to your requests. 
We may forward your e-mail to other Government employees or contract 
personnel who are better able to answer your questions. We do not retain 
or distribute lists of e-mail addresses to any parties outside of the 
USGS except as necessary to conduct official U.S. Government business. 
In any event, we do not distribute lists of e-mail addresses to non-Government 
entities or for commercial purposes.</p>

<p><b><br>
Online surveys</b><br>
When you voluntarily provide us with personal information as part
of our online survey, we use it to perform various quantitative
and qualitative analyses to improve customer service and satisfaction.
We may forward the information collected to other Government employees
or contract personnel to perform the actual analysis. You are
under no obligation to participate in such surveys. Nonparticipation
will not inhibit your use of our Web site in any way. If you provided
the information to us in error, you may request its removal at
any time.</p>

<p><br>
<b>Marketing Information</b><br>
We may collect information from you, with your permission, that will allow 
us to provide customer services, such as subscription notifications. We may 
forward the information collected to other Government employees or contract 
personnel to provide specific marketing services. We will remove such 
information at your request.</p>

<p><br>
<b>Collection and Release of Gathered Information</b><br>
We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally identifying 
information about you when you visit our Web sites unless you choose to provide 
such information to us. Except for officially authorized law enforcement 
investigations, or in the event of a suspected attempt to deliberately circumvent 
our system's security with the intent to gain unauthorized access or do physical 
damage (for example, an attack by hackers), we do not attempt to identify 
individual users or share any information we receive with any parties outside of 
the USGS. In the latter case, collected information associated with a suspected 
intruder might be shared through the USGS's Bureau Information Resources Security 
Administrator with an incident response service such as the 
<a href="http://www.cert.org/">CERT<sup><font size="+1">® </font></sup>
Coordination Center</a>.</p>

<p><br>
<b>Retention of Collected Information<br>
Web server activity logs</b> - Monthly extracts of the log files are archived and 
stored offline at our discretion for an indefinite period of time. Some statistical 
summaries derived from these data may be retained online or offline at our discretion 
for an indefinite period of time.</p>

<p><b>E-mail</b> - Information collected through e-mail will be retained at our 
discretion in a directly readable form for as long as necessary to complete our 
response. The e-mail may be retained in an archival form as required by Federal 
laws and regulations governing the retention of historical records of Government 
agencies. For more information, refer to the National Archives and 
<a href="http://www.nara.gov/records/">Records 
Administration's Records Management Program.</a>

</p><p><b>Online surveys</b> - Information collected through online surveys may be 
maintained at our discretion for an indefinite period of time.

</p><p><b>Marketing information</b> - Such information may be maintained at our discretion 
  for an indefinite period of time</p>
