<hr>
<p><a name="PrivacyPolicyOverview" class="tableOfContentsHeaderSpacing anchor-no-hover-common-cls"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY OVERVIEW</strong></a></p>

</ul>
<p><a name="InformationCollectedfromTrackingTechnologies" class="tableOfContentsHeaderSpacing anchor-no-hover-common-cls"><strong>Information Collected from Tracking Technologies</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Information Collected Using Technology</em></strong><em>. </em>ALM may use a variety of technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”, which are further described <a href="http://www.alm.com/tracking-technologies/">here</a>) to gather personal and non-personal information (which is any information that does not reveal your specific identity) automatically (or passively) whenever you visit or interact with the Online Services. We also work with third parties to provide certain functionalities on the Online Services and to improve the effectiveness of the Online Services and its content. Separate and distinct from information ALM shares with third parties (as further described <a href="#WithWhomDoesALMSharethePersonalInformationitCollects">below</a>), third party companies may also use Tracking Technologies to independently collect and store information about you and your usage of the Online Services and may combine this information with information they collect from other sources. Please note, we do not control Tracking Technologies used by third parties, and their use may be governed by the privacy policies of the third parties employing the Tracking Technologies. Some of the Tracking Technologies that may be used to collect information are described below. To learn how to turn off certain Tracking Technologies, see <a href="#TurningOffTrackingTechnologies">below</a>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Device</em></strong><strong><em> Information</em></strong>. ALM may collect certain, non-personal information about the Device you use to access ALM’s services, including but not limited to IP addresses for your Devices, unique device identifiers, browser types, browser language and other transactional information that does not personally identify you.</li>
<li><strong><em>User</em></strong><strong><em> History</em></strong>: ALM may log certain usage information about your use of the Online Services, which may include a history of the pages you view. If you download and use any ALM software application on your Device, the log files will automatically be collected by the application and sent to ALM’s servers when your Device syncs up for the latest content available.</li>
<li><strong><em>Mobile/Location Information</em></strong>.&nbsp; We may collect additional information from you if you access the Online Services through a mobile device, for example your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, or location when you opt in for us to do so. However the degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using (e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, WiFi, etc.). If you enable location services for the Online Services we may collect regional location data periodically as you use or leave open the Online Services. We may also collect your location information from you IP address or zip code. We may also use location data internally or in conjunction with our third party service providers to customize your experience and provide offers that may be relevant to you. Depending on the platform you use to access the Online Services (e.g., Apple™ iOS, Google™ Android, Windows, etc.) you may be able to control from within the settings on your wireless device whether location data is collected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES AND LEXISNEXIS</strong>:</p>
<p>When you log into ALM through your LexisNexis account or social networking accounts, link your social networking accounts with the Online Services or engage with Online Services through the LexisNexis platform or third party social media platforms, you understand that you may be allowing us ongoing access to certain information stored on those platforms. In addition, as you interact with the Online Services, you may also be providing information about your activities to LexisNexis or the third party social networking platforms, as applicable. You should make sure that you are comfortable with the information such services may make available to us by visiting the applicable platforms’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those platforms.</p>
<p><a name="WhatDoesALMdowiththeInformationitCollects" class="tableOfContentsHeaderSpacing anchor-no-hover-common-cls"><strong>WHAT DOES ALM DO WITH THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?</strong></a></p>
<p>ALM uses your personal and non-personal information that it collects from you and about you for the purposes set forth below. For the avoidance of doubt, ALM may use and disclose non-personal information for any purpose, except where ALM is required to do otherwise under applicable law. If ALM is required to treat non-personal information as personal information under applicable law, then ALM may use and disclose it for all the purposes for which ALM uses and discloses your personal information.  ALM may use the information collected from one portion of the Online Services on other portions of the Online Services, and ALM may combine information gathered from multiple portions of the Online Services into a single record. ALM may also use or combine information that ALM collects offline or from third-party sources with your information collected from the Online Services.  Additionally, data collected from a particular browser or Device may be used with another computer or Device that is associated with the browser or Device on which such data was collected, or transferred to a third party who may be able to track your activity across Devices.  ALM may use this information to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Enable Usage</em></strong><em>: </em>ALM uses the information it gathers about you to enable your use of ALM’s products and services, including but not limited to accessing the Online Services, receiving e-newsletters, renewing paid services, participating in message boards and receiving requested product and services.</li>

<li><strong><em>Advertising</em></strong>. We use third-party ad servers and ad networks that use tracking technology to collect information about your visits on other services and when you access the Online Services to send you targeted advertisements. They automatically receive your IP address or mobile device identifier when this happens. They may also use <a href="#InformationCollectedfromTrackingTechnologies">Tracking Technologies</a> to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and to personalize the advertising content and to serve you advertisements that are relevant to your regional location. We may also use information collected using third party cookies and beacons on the Online Services and in our emails to deliver advertising about the Online Services displayed to you on third party services. Google is one of the companies that we use to serve advertising and perform analytics on some of the Online Services. We and third party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Online Services. To learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs for the Web, <a href="#GoogleAnalytics">click here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Statistical Analysis</em></strong>: ALM may perform statistical, and marketing analyses of user behavior for a variety of purposes, such as to measure interest in the various areas of ALM sites, to better understand subscription and purchasing patterns for product development purposes and to inform advertisers about ALM’s subscriber base. ALM also uses third parties to provide ALM with information, reports and analysis about the usage and browsing patterns of users of ALM products and services. Such third parties track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information about ALM visitors and customers with respect to the Online Services and track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of users of the Online Services.</li>
<li><strong><em>Account Maintenance and Service Updates</em></strong>: ALM may utilize the contact information you provided at registration, such as your telephone number and email address, to contact you regarding your account, your subscriptions and other products or services which you have requested or in which you are currently enrolled.  These may include order confirmations, renewals/expiration notices, notifications about credit card issues, and changes to the subscriber agreement and ALM products.</li>
<li><strong><em>Push Notifications</em></strong>. The Online Services may include a function that allows us to use push notifications to send you updates, communications, and other messages about the Online Services.   To opt out of getting these push notifications or other messages, you must turn off the push notification function within your device settings.</li>
<li><strong><em>E-Mail Newsletters:</em></strong> If you have registered to receive email newsletters, you shall receive emails specifically for such newsletters. If you choose to no longer receive such email newsletters, you may unsubscribe from such emails (see <a href="#OptingOutCorrectionsandCancellations">below</a> for instructions).</li>
<li><strong><em>E-Mail Promotions.</em></strong> ALM may also periodically send you email messages about products and services that ALM or its partners think may be of interest to you. If you choose not to receive such emails, you may unsubscribe from such emails (see <a href="#OptingOutCorrectionsandCancellations">below</a> for instructions).</li>
<li><strong><em>Other Emails:</em></strong> If you use the “Email This Article” feature to email links to articles, the email that you supply to ALM may be saved for your convenience only (for clarification, any such email address provided to email links to articles will not be used or shared by ALM for any other purpose).  If you send ALM emails, you should be aware that any information provided in an email may not be secure or encrypted and therefore may be available to others. Please exercise caution if you decide to disclose any personal or confidential information in such email and please be advised that you should not provide detailed credit card information directly to ALM via an unsecure form (such as email).  ALM representatives shall use your email address to respond to any of your questions or comments.</li>
<li><strong><em>Administrator Uses</em></strong><em>. </em>If your use of the Online Services is managed for you by an account administrator then your account administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization may have access to your personal information (including your email and other data).

<li><strong><em>Archival Purposes</em></strong><em>. </em>Personal and other information that you provide to us in the course of participating in the Online Services may be gathered and stored in one or more of our corporate databases. We may retain information from canceled accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our terms of use, or take other actions permitted by law. We may also retain information to prevent re- registration in the event that your account has been suspended or terminated or to create an archival copy of your information, which might be used by us for recordkeeping and internal purposes. We will retain your information for the period of time necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="WithWhomDoesALMSharethePersonalInformationitCollects" class="tableOfContentsHeaderSpacing  anchor-no-hover-common-cls"><strong>WITH WHOM DOES ALM SHARE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?</strong></a></p>

Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">here</a>. It is important to remember that many of ALM’s services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, ALM needs first-party cookies to log you in to read stories that require registration or a subscription. In that case, you may set your browser to block third-party cookies and allow ALM’s first-party cookies only.</li>
<li><strong><a name="GoogleAnalytics" class="anchor-no-hover-common-cls">Google Analytics</a></strong>. Google is one of the companies that we use to serve advertising and perform analytics on some of the Online Services.

You can opt out of receiving interest-based Google ads, or customize the ads Google shows you, by clicking <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated">here</a>. ALM also uses third party services for remarketing ALM’s products and services, such as Google’s Customer Match via the Google platform, whereby we will deliver targeted ads to you based on your prior usage on the Online Services. If you want to opt-out of remarketing, please email us at <a href="mailto:almlegal@alm.com?subject=Privacy%20-%20Policy">ALMLegal@ALM.com</a>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Network Advertising Initiative</em></strong>. Some of our advertising service providers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. However, if you opt-out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages from us after you opt-out, but other members of the Network Advertising Initiative will not be able to target you based on your use of the Online Services and/or third party websites.

<li><em> <strong>“Do Not Track” Signals.</strong></em> Some third party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitor’s choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, at this time, ALM does not respond to browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms. Go to http://www.networkadvertising.org or http://www.aboutads.info if you wish to learn more about your options to not accept tracking cookies for the purpose of receiving targeted interest-based advertisements.
