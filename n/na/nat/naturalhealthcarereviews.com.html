<p>We have&nbsp;created this privacy statement in order to  demonstrate our  firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of  personal information  provided by those visiting and interacting with  this web site. naturalhealthcarereviews.com&nbsp; hold the privacy of your personal  information in  the highest regard. The following discloses our  information gathering  and dissemination practices for this website.</p>
<p><strong>We recognize the importance of protecting your privacy</strong> and  our policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we  collect,  use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us  and to  assist you in making informed decisions when using our site.  This policy  will be continuously assessed against new technologies,  business  practices and our customers’ needs.</p>
<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong><strong><br>
</strong>When  you visit this web site you may provide us with two types  of  information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose  that  is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information   collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
<p><strong>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Registration Information</strong><br>
When you register for any of our products, services or newsletters you will provide us information about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Email Information</strong><br>
If you choose to correspond  with us through email, we may retain the  content of your email messages  together with your email address and our  responses. We provide the same  protections for these electronic  communications that we employ in the  maintenance of information  received by mail and telephone.<br>
<strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard   technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are  Cookies?”)  and web server log files to collect information about how  our Web site  is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web  server logs may  include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed,  time spent at our  Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and  just after our Web  site.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</strong></p>
<p>Broadly  speaking, we use personal information for purposes of  administering our  business activities, providing the products and  services you requested,  to process your payment, to monitor the use of  the service, our marketing and promotional efforts and improve our  content and service offerings, and customize our site’s content, layout,  services and for other lawful purposes. These uses improve our site and  better tailor it to meet your needs.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  such information may be shared with others on an  aggregate basis.  Personally identifiable information or business  information will not be  shared with parties except as required by law.</p>
<p>Occasionally,  we may also use the information we collect to notify  you about  important changes to our Website, new services, and special  offers we  think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time  if you do  not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at the link  provided on  the newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong><br>
A cookie is a very small  text document, which often includes an  anonymous unique identifier. When  you visit a Web site, that site’s  computer asks your computer for  permission to store this file in a part  of your hard drive specifically  designated for cookies. Each Web site  can send its own cookie to your  browser if your browser’s preferences  allow it, but (to protect your  privacy) your browser only permits a Web  site to access the cookies it  has already sent to you, not the cookies  sent to you by other sites.  Browsers are usually set to accept  cookies. However, if you would prefer  not to receive cookies, you may  alter the configuration of your browser  to refuse cookies. If you  choose to have your browser refuse cookies,  it is possible that some  areas of our site will not function as  effectively when viewed by the  users.<strong>A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</strong><br>
As you visit and browse our  Web site, the site uses cookies to  differentiate you from other users.  In some cases, we also use cookies  to prevent you from having to log in  more than is necessary for  security. Cookies, in conjunction with our  Web server’s log files,  allow us to calculate the aggregate number of  people visiting our Web  site and which parts of the site are most  popular. This helps us gather  feedback to constantly improve our Web  site and better serve our  clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any  personal information  about you and we do not intentionally store any  personal information  that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
IP addresses are used by  your computer every time you are connected to  the Internet. Your IP  address is a number that is used by computers on  the network to identify  your computer. IP addresses are automatically  collected by our web  server as part of demographic and profile data  known as traffic data so  that data (such as the Web pages you request)  can be sent to you.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing and Selling Information</strong><br>
We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, lend or lease any of the  information that uniquely identify  a subscriber (such as email  addresses or personal details) with anyone  except to the extent it is  necessary to process transactions or provide  services that you have  requested.</p>
<p><strong>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</strong><br>
You may request access to  all your personally identifiable information  that we collect online and  maintain in our database by emailing us at  the usual address.</p>
<p><strong>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>
</strong>We  may disclose information when legally compelled to do so,  in other  words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires  it or for  the protection of our legal rights. We  may also disclose  account information when we have reason to believe  that disclosing this  information is necessary to identify, contact or  bring legal action  against someone who may be violating our Terms of  Service or to protect  the safety of our users and the Public.</p>
<p><strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</strong><br>
We are not responsible for  the practices employed by Web sites linked  to or from our Web site or  the information or content contained  therein. Often links to other Web  sites are provided solely as pointers  to information on topics that may  be useful to the users of our Web  site.</p>
<p>Please  remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to  another web  site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your  browsing and  interaction on any other web site, including web sites,  which have a  link on our Website, is subject to that Web site’s own  rules and  policies. Please read over those rules and policies before  proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>Your Consent</strong><br>
By using our Web site you  consent to our collection and use of your  personal information as  described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve  the right to amend this  privacy policy at any time with or without  notice.</p>
<p><em><strong>Our Commitment To Data Security:</strong></em></p>
<p>Please  note that your information will be stored and processed on  our  computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data  in the  United States may be less stringent than the laws of your  Country of  residence or citizenship. To  prevent unauthorized access,  maintain data accuracy, and ensure the  correct use of information, we  have put in place appropriate physical,  electronic, and managerial  procedures to safeguard and secure the  information we collect online.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out<br>
</strong>This  site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not  receive future  messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue  sending the  particular messages as soon as technically feasible.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong></p>
<p>From  time-to-time our site requests information from users via  surveys or  contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is  completely  voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not  to disclose  this information. Information requested may include  contact information  (such as name and shipping address), and  demographic information (such  as zip code, age level). Contact  information will be used to notify the  winners and award prizes. Survey  information will be used for purposes  of monitoring or improving the  use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
<p><strong>A Special Note About Children</strong></p>
<p>Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask  that children (under  the age of 14) do not submit any personal  information to us. If you are  a minor, you can use this service only in  conjunction with permission  and guidance from your parents or  guardians.</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</strong></p>
<p>In  the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its  assets) is  acquired, your information would be considered part of those  assets,  and may be part of those assets that are transferred.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Modifications<br>
</strong>We  may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when  changes are  made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have  given us  permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure  to check  back periodically. However, please be assured that if the  Privacy Policy  changes in the future, we will not use the personal  information you  have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a  manner that is  materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy,  without your prior  consent.</p>
