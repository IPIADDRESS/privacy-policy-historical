                        rules for sharing customer information. It requires financial

                        institution's privacy policy and practices to new customers 
                        and annually thereafter. We believe that your privacy

                        - Sharing information amongst National City companies 
                        helps us to prevent fraud. Your accounts and your personal 
                        identity are better protected from thieves and imposters, 
                        and National City is less vulnerable to losses from fraud.

                        able to serve you faster and more efficiently when they 
                        have access to all of your bank relationships and account
