You have chosen to do business with National City, and we guard that relationship with great care, beginning with the information you have chosen to share with us. <b>That is why we have opted out for you as a matter of corporate policy. National City does not share information about you outside of our National City companies unless permitted by Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and other applicable laws and regulations.</b></p><p>National City Corporation, its family of financial services companies (âaffiliatesâ) and employees, are dedicated to protecting the privacy of your nonpublic personal information.

The confidentiality of your nonpublic personal information will continue to be maintained consistent with this privacy notice even if you decide to close your account(s), your account becomes inactive, or when you otherwise cease to do business with us.</p><p>National City works with a variety of third parties to bring you financial services. We disclose information about you as necessary to fulfill these third party service agreements. For example, we may disclose information about you to third parties that assist us in servicing or maintaining your loan or deposit<b> </b>account, or other business relationship, such as printing checks or billing you for loan payments. We may also disclose information about you to governmental entities, such as sending annual income statements to the IRS, and to other third parties such as credit bureaus, or in response to subpoenas. </p><p>We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to third parties that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions, such as insurance providers, with whom we have joint marketing agreements in order to make a variety of financial services available to you*. These third parties must agree<b> </b>to strict confidentiality provisions<b> </b>to assure the protection of your information. Because we already limit the sharing of your nonpublic personal information as outlined above, no action is necessary on your part to limit such sharing.</p><p><b>Fair Credit Reporting Act Disclosure*</b></p><p>We share information about you with our affiliates. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act you may direct us not to share certain credit information with our affiliates. Examples of the kind of credit information that you may direct us not to share include the nonpublic personal information you provide in your application or that we obtain about you from nonaffiliated third parties such as credit bureaus.

Frequently Asked Questions</b></p><p>National City is dedicated to protecting the privacy of your nonpublic personal information. Federal law establishes rules for sharing customer information. It requires financial institutions to deliver a privacy notice explaining the institutionâs privacy policy and practices to new customers and annually thereafter.  We believe that your privacy should never be compromised.  National Cityâs privacy notice describes how we collect and use your nonpublic personal information. It will help you understand the careful attention we devote to handling and protecting your nonpublic personal information. </p><p>Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about privacy to help you understand National Cityâs position on this important issue.</p></div><div style="margin-left: 19pt"><p><b>1. Does the National City Privacy Notice cover all my National City accounts?</b></p></div><div style="margin-left: 18pt"><p>Yes, however, you may receive more than one copy of the notice from National City if you have several accounts or do business with more than one National City company.  This helps us to ensure that all customers receive it. </p></div><div style="margin-left: 19pt"><p><b>2. Does National Cityâs Privacy Notice apply to businesses?</b></p></div><div style="margin-left: 18pt"><p>No. The privacy notice applies to individual customers who obtain products and services for personal, family or household purposes.  It does not apply to business customers, including Sole Proprietors when the purpose is business related.</p></div><div style="margin-left: 19pt"><p><b>3. What is â<i>nonpublic personal information</i>â?</b></p></div><div style="margin-left: 18pt"><p><i>âNonpublic personal informationâ</i> is information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service.  For example, this might include information such as account balances, income, assets, and insurance premiums. Generally speaking, nonpublic personal information is information that is not available in public records. </p></div><div style="margin-left: 19pt"><p><b>4. Do you sell information about me to other companies?</b></p></div><div style="margin-left: 18pt"><p>No. We will not sell information about you. We honor the trust that you have placed in National City to keep information about you confidential.</p></div><div style="margin-left: 19pt"><p><b>5. When does National City share nonpublic information about me with third parties?</b></p></div><div style="margin-left: 18pt"><p>We limit the ways that we share information to the purposes permitted by the new privacy law. These permissible information sharing exceptions fall into three categories:</p></div><div style="margin-left: 18pt"><ul><li class="content" valign="top" width="569"><b><u> Servicing and Joint Marketing:</u></b> We share information with companies that perform services on our behalf, like check printers. We also share information with companies that we hire to help us market our National City products and services. National City is able to offer you a broader selection of product and service options to help you achieve your financial goals when we contract with select financial institutions that offer financial services. Any information shared for servicing or joint marketing is pursuant to an agreement with the third party that requires them to adhere to strict confidentiality terms. They are not permitted to use information provided to them for any purpose whatsoever other than for the specific reason it was provided to them by National City. </li><li class="content" valign="top" width="569"><b><u> Processing and Servicing Transactions:</u></b> Information is shared, as necessary, to service and process financial products and services that are requested by you, such as wire transfers or loan applications.  Information is also shared in connection with maintaining and servicing your accounts, such as statement preparation, complaint resolution, or debt collection.</li><li class="content" valign="top" width="569"><b><u> Other Lawful or Required Purposes:</u> </b>This category includes a variety of permissible sharing situations, such as when you request or consent to have information shared, or when we share information with our auditors, attorneys or accountants, government regulators, in response to subpoenas, and other circumstances where sharing information is permitted or required by law.</li></ul></div><div style="margin-left: 19pt"><p><b>6. What is third party opt-out and why do some financial institutions offer this opt-out to their customers when National City does not offer it?</b></p></div><div style="margin-left: 18pt"><p>Did you notice the box checked at the top of our privacy notice? National City believes your privacy is so important that we have effectively opted out for you.  You may receive notices from other financial institutions with whom you do business that include a third party information sharing opt-out provision.  National City is not required to provide you with a third party information sharing opt-out choice because we already restrict our information sharing practices to those allowed by law and discussed above in question six.  In other words, our sharing practices are more conservative than those of institutions that must provide their customers with third party opt-out.</p></div><div style="margin-left: 19pt"><p><b>7. Why does National City share information about me with other National City companies</b>?</p></div><div style="margin-left: 18pt"><p>There are many benefits to sharing information within our National City family of companies. These are just a few:</p><p><i><u>Fraud Prevention</u></i> â Sharing information amongst National City companies helps us to prevent fraud. Your accounts and your personal identity are better protected from thieves and imposters, and National City is less vulnerable to losses from fraud. Consumer fraud is costly. Controlling it keeps your costs down. </p><p><i><u>Enhanced Service</u></i> â Sharing information enables us to provide you with superior service. For example, our retail bank Call Centers are able to serve you faster and more efficiently when they have access to all of your bank relationships and account information. You have the convenience of calling just one number to have most of your banking questions answered.</p><p><i><u>Tailored Products and Services</u></i> â Knowledge of your account relationships, balances and transaction behavior helps us to identify what products and services may be most interesting to you. We use this information to keep you informed about those suited to you. It also helps us to identify and notify you when market conditions are favorable to you. For example, we can analyze the impact of lower interest rates on your mortgage and notify you when conditions are right for you to benefit financially from refinancing your home.</p></div><div style="margin-left: 19pt"><p><b>8.
