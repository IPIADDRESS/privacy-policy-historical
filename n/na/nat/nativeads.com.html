                        <br>

                        <h4>Anonymous User Information (Data)</h4>

                        <p>Non-personal information is any information that does not personally identify you. We obtain non-personal information about you from information that you provide to us (anonymous information may be automatically provided to our Web servers by your computer). This information is collected when Publishers, advertisers, and ad networks use the Native Ads Platform.</p>

                        <h4>User Information</h4>

                        <p>As part of our ad delivery and reporting, we log page views and collect information for the purpose of delivering ads or providing advertising-related services, including providing a specific advertisement based on a particular type of browser or time of day; statistical reporting in connection with the activity on a Web site; and tracking the number of ads served on a particular day to a particular Web site(tracking web analytics data).

                             As of May 25, 2018, a new data privacy law known as the EU General Data
                            Protection Regulation (or the “GDPR”) will be in effect through the EEA
                            countries and Switzerland. The GDPR requires NativeAds and those using our
                            services to provide users with certain information about the processing of
                            their “Personal Data. “Personal Data” is a term used in Europe that means,

                          <p>
                             The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal basis we’re relying on to
                            process any Personal Data about you.  The legal basis for us processing your
                            Personal Data for the purposes set out above will typically be because:
                            <br>
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              <em>You provided your consent.</em>
                               In order to store and gain access to information stored on your device,
                              we rely on your consent. For this so-called “cookie consent” (which
                              applies not only to “cookies” but also to mobile ad identifiers), we rely
                              on our own compliance steps and our web and mobile partners’ compliance
                              steps, designed to ensure that consent is collected and passed on to
                              partners, and to ensure that we only facilitate the collection of legally
                              obtained data. We do this to fulfill our obligations under the ePrivacy
                              Directive. We may choose to obtain consent in other cases as well, in
                              which case we will adhere to applicable laws relating to such consent and
                              its withdrawal.

                               In some cases, we use legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing
                              Personal Data, in order to provide our and/or other data controllers’
                              services. Such processing goes beyond the original collection of mobile ad
                              identifiers. A legitimate interest we rely on, for instance, is the
                              tailoring of promotional communications to users of web and mobile
                              properties, which is beneficial to users and is an integral part of the
                              ecosystem by which freely available content is funded through advertising
                              revenue. This also sometimes includes providing analysis of and reporting
                              about ad campaigns, as well.

                            <li>
                              We also rely on legitimate interest when we use Personal Data to maintain
                              the security of our Services, such as to detect fraud or to ensure that
                              bugs are detected and fixed.

                               Sometimes, we process certain data as necessary under a contractual
                              relationship we have (such as our customer records and contact
                              information);

                               Finally, some processing of data may be necessary for us to comply with
                              our legal or regulatory obligations.

                              a data controller, you may do so by requesting access through the e-mail
                              address support AT NativeAds DOT com. When we receive your request, we
                              will provide you with current, step-by-step instructions to follow in
                              order to obtain access. As we are required to verify a requestor’s
                              identity prior to providing Personal Data, we will assess requests to
                              exercise certain data access rights on a case-by-case basis: in doing so,
                              we consider (a) the difficulty of verifying whether data that we hold and
                              data we have linked to it truly and solely belongs to the data subject
                              making the request, along with (b) the potential adverse affects on
                              disclosure of personal data to the wrong individual. Because such improper
                              disclosure would likely adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms
                              of the data subject, we may limit the Personal Data we make available.

                              this right manually. Please note, however, that we may retain copies of
                              certain Personal Data on inactive or back-up files, for our own internal
                              and necessary purposes, such as auditing, accounting and billing, legal or
                              bug-detection. We will in most cases delete such data within 36 months,
                              absent a compelling reason to retain it.

                             EU data protection law makes a distinction between organisations that
                            process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”)
                            and organisations that process Personal Data on behalf of other
                            organisations (known as “data processors”). As noted above, we are not
                            always a data controller of the data in our possession, but are sometimes a
                            data processor for other companies such as our customers. In such cases, we
                            may direct your inquiry to the relevant data controller, since data
                            controllers are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data.
