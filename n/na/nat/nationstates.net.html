<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="smalltext"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 14, 2014

</p><p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 
"Personally identifiable information" (PII) is being used online. 
PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on 
its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to 
identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear 
understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your 
Personally Identifiable Information.

</p><p>While NationStates is not hosted in the US and has no American ownership, we aim to comply 
with US privacy law.

</p><h2 id="infoCo">What personal information does NationStates collect from people who visit our website?</h2>
<p>NationStates may collect:
</p><ul><li><p>Your IP address.
</p></li><li><p>Your e-mail address.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>When does NationStates collect information?</h2>
<p>Your IP address is collected whenever you visit any page. This happens any time you
browse any website: your browser transmits your IP address so that the remote site knows where to
send back data.
</p><p>Your e-mail address is collected if you supply one either during registration (i.e.
nation creation) or by entering one later via your <a href="/page=settings">Settings</a>.
You do not need to supply an e-mail address to browse the site, nor to create an account.
However, if you choose to join the <a href="/page=un">World Assembly</a>, 
an e-mail address is required, and a verification message is sent to this.

</p><h2 id="infoUs">How does NationStates use your information? </h2>
<p>NationStates uses the information collected from you:
</p><ul>
<li><p>To help enforce a site rule limiting players to one World Assembly member nation per person
</p></li><li><p>To help identify when a site visitor is banned from the site for rule violations by moderators.
</p></li><li><p>If you have supplied an e-mail address:
</p><ul>
<li><p>To send you an e-mail notification when your account is about to be deleted for lack of activity. (You can disable this in your <a href="/page=settings">Settings</a>.)
</p></li><li><p>To send you topic update notification e-mails for any forum topics to which you manually subscribe to receive such updates.
</p></li><li><p>To send you a verification e-mail if you choose to join the World Assembly.
</p></li><li><p>To respond to inquiries and/or other requests or questions.
</p></li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="infoPro">How does NationStates protect visitor information?</h2>
<p>NationStates is in the process of rolling out SSL (secure, encrypted connection) site-wide. Currently, SSL is optionally provided
at <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/">https://www.nationstates.net</a>. If you use this SSL site, all information
that passes between your computer and our site is encrypted, 
which prevents snooping by any third parties that may share your network.

</p><p>If you do not use SSL, all information you send to NationStates, including your 
password and e-mail address,
is transmitted in plain text, and could be compromised by an attacker who shares your network.

</p><p>User passwords are encryped and never stored in plain text. 

</p><p>Moderators and administrators will not publicly disclose personal information

</p><h2 id="coUs">Does NationStates use cookies?</h2>
<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your
browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and 
remember certain information.

</p><p>NationStates uses cookies:

</p><ul>
<li><p>To record that you have logged in (i.e. as a session identifier).
</p></li><li><p>To help enforce a site rule limiting players to one World Assembly member nation per person.
</p></li><li><p>To help identify when a site visitor is banned from the site for rule violations by moderators.
</p></li><li><p>To track aggregate visitor information with Google Analytics. You can
find out more about Google Analytics cookies, as well as other Analytics-related privacy
information,
<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">here</a>.
</p></li><li><p>Serve ads via Google AdSense and third-party partners. In this case, cookies are used to
target ads based on your prior visits to this and other websites. For more information, including how to prevent this cookie being stored on your computer, 
see the <a href="/page=privacy#gooAd">Google AdSense</a> section below.
</p></li></ul>

<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn 
off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your 
browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

</p><p><strong>If you disable cookies in your browser:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li><p>You will not be able to remain logged in to NationStates. You can, however, browse the site anonymously.
</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="trDi">Third Party Disclosure</h2>
<p>NationStates does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally 
identifiable information.
This does not include website hosting partners and other parties
who assist in operating the website, so long as those parties
agree to keep this information confidential. NationStates may also release your information when we believe release
is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce site policies, or protect ours or others' rights,
property, or safety.
In the event that ownership of NationStates transfers to a third party
in the future, said party
will be bound by these same conditions, and be required to notify users in advance
should they wish to alter them.

</p><p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for
advertising or other uses.

</p><h2 id="siDi">In-Site Disclosure</h2>
<p>NationStates does not disclose your personally identifiable information via forum post or
any other kind of in-site communication to other users. For example, moderators are not
permitted to inform users of another user's IP address or e-mail address.

</p><p>A user may sometimes post their own information (IP address or e-mail address) in order
to seek technical help. This is not recommended, and we instruct users to use a private
channel instead (the <a href="/page=help">Getting Help</a> page).


</p><h2 id="nsPup">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>Please be aware that NationStates may disclose non-personally identifiable information
you provide. In particular, if you operate multiple accounts, site moderators may publicly 
disclose (by posting on the site) that these accounts are connected—operated by the 
same person—while not personally identifying you.

</p><p>This is done in order to enforce site rules and etiquette, 
e.g. to combat "puppet wanking," when a person posts from multiple accounts 
in order to promote the false impression that many people agree with them.

</p><p>Information that does not personally identify you is not the subject of this document.

</p><h2 id="subCon">Submitted Content</h2>
<p>Users can voluntarily post content to NationStates in a variety of ways, such as:
</p><ul><li><p>Sending a telegram to another nation.
</p></li><li><p>Posting on a regional message board (RMB).
</p></li><li><p>Posting in the forums.
</p></li><li><p>Writing a factbook or dispatch.
</p></li><li><p>Uploading an image to use as a national flag.
</p></li><li><p>Voting in a poll or World Assembly motion.
</p></li><li><p>Customizing their nation via fields such as its name, national slogan, currency, and animal.
</p></li><li><p>Writing a World Assembly proposal.
</p></li><li><p>Submitting an Issue.
</p></li></ul>

<p>All such content can be viewed by moderators and/or administrators.

</p><p>With particular reference to <b>telegrams</b>, NationStates assumes a <em>higher but
incomplete</em> level of privacy. Our policy:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Moderators may only view the content of telegrams of another nation when they have <em>cause</em>.
A moderator has cause to inspect telegrams when they have reasonable grounds to believe a violation
of site rules has occurred or is likely to occur in the near future (e.g. in response to a user
complaint about harassment), or 
when the nation in question is being considered for elevation to the moderation team. 
When investigating telegrams, moderators are permitted to view both sides of a conversation,
even when only one party is being investigated.
</p></li><li><p>Our system requires moderators to enter a reason/reference to view a telegram,
which is permanently logged. This enables administrators and other moderators to verify who viewed
which telegram, when, and for what reason, in order to ensure compliance
with site policy.
</p></li><li><p>NationStates does not disclose which telegrams have been viewed by moderators,
but does investigate internally any query as to whether site policy was followed.
</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="gooAd">Google AdSense</h2>
<p>NationStates uses Google AdSense to display ads to most visitors. You can view 
<a href="http://www.google.com.au/policies/privacy/">Google's main Privacy Policy</a>
and their more specific 
<a href="http://www.google.com.au/policies/technologies/ads/">Advertising Privacy Policy</a>.
Google lets you change your ad preferences via
<a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Google Ad Settings</a>.

</p><p>NationStates has implemented the following:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Google Display Network Impression Reporting
</p></li><li><p>Demographics and Interests Reporting
</p></li><li><p>DoubleClick Platform Integration
</p></li></ul>

<p>You should know that:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your visits to this website (for example to distinguish between a new and returning visitor, and track which ads you have clicked on before).
</p></li><li><p>Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit not only to NationStates but other sites using the DoubleClick network across the Internet.
</p></li><li><p>You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Google Ad Settings</a>. You can opt out of third-party vendors' use of cookies for interest based advertising at <a href="http://aboutads.info/">aboutads.info</a>.
</p></li><li><p>A list of approved ad exchange vendors, which may serve ads on NationStates via Google DoubleClick, is available <a href="https://support.google.com/3pascertification/table/4570113">here</a>.
</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="calOppa">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the US to require commercial websites 
and online services to post a privacy policy. The law aims to reach beyond 
California to require any person or company  
that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information 
from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website 
stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom 
it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. More information is available
<a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/">here</a>.

</p><p>In accordance with CalOPPA, NationStates agrees that:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Users can visit our site anonymously.
</p></li><li><p>A link to this Privacy Policy will be maintained on the <a href="/page=welcome">NationStates home page</a>.
</p></li><li><p>The Privacy Policy link includes the word "Privacy" and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
</p></li><li><p>When privacy policy changes, this fact will be posted and timestamped at the top of this Privacy Policy page.
</p></li><li><p>Users are usually able to change some of their personal information by logging in to their account.
Specifically, users with active accounts can change their current e-mail address.
Users with deleted nations can restore their account and log in.
However, users of accounts that are perma-deleted by moderators, banned from the site,
or otherwise permanently barred from the public site are thereafter not able to log in and change their personal
information. 
Users are never able to change their IP address, which is not publicly displayed but is
logged. All information may be archived in periodic private system backups.
</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="coppAct">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, 
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
The Federal Trade Commission, the US consumer protection agency, enforces 
the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services 
must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

</p><p>NationStates does not specifically market to children under 13.

</p><h2 id="ftcFip">Fair Information Practices</h2>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law 
in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant 
role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding 
the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented 
is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

</p><p>In line with Fair Information Practices, NationStates will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: users will be notified via a message posted on the site within seven business days.

</p><p>NationStates also agrees to the individual redress principle, which requires that 
individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data 
collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires 
not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also 
that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate 
and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

</p><h2 id="canSpam">CAN SPAM Act</h2>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes 
requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails 
stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

</p><p><strong>NationStates does not send any advertising or promotional e-mail messages.
If you supply your email address, it may be used:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li><p>To help enforce a site rule limiting players to one World Assembly member nation per person
</p></li><li><p>To help identify when a site visitor is banned from the site for rule violations by moderators.
</p></li><li><p>To send you an e-mail notification when your account is about to be deleted for lack of activity. (You may disable this in your <a href="/page=settings">Settings</a>.)
</p></li><li><p>To send you topic update notification e-mails for any forum topics to which you manually subscribe to receive such updates.
</p></li><li><p>To respond to inquiries and/or other requests or questions.
</p></li></ul>

<p><strong><br>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future e-mails, you can</strong>:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email; or
</p></li><li><p><a href="/page=help">Contact us</a>
</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="ourCon">Contacting Us</h2>
<p>If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, or you require
