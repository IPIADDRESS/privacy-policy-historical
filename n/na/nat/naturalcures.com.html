	Privacy Policy | NaturalCures.com</h2>



<p class="buttonheading">
	</p>





<p>Snowflake Information Services (NaturalCures.com) recognizes the importance of  protecting the privacy of all information provided by our users. We  created the following policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for  our users' right to privacy to guide our relationships with our users.</p>
<ul>
<li>The kinds of personal information we collect from users of the  Site and how that information is collected;</li>
<li>How we use your personal information; </li>
<li>The circumstances under which we disclose personal information to  third parties; and </li>
<li>The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your personal  information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information  only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following  policies are only to transactions made and data gathered on web pages,  discussion lists and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by SIS  and does not apply to any other transactions, information, web site or  Internet, telephone or offline point of contact between SIS and you or  other consumers.  As we continue to develop our Site and take advantage  of technologies to improve the services we offer, this policy may  change. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon  posting.  We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an  ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions of this Privacy are legally binding on all  users. By using this web site, you consent to this Agreement and to the  collection and use of information by SIS as specified below.</p>
<h3>What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?</h3>
<p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a  set of numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP  address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the SIS  Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain  name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing  personal about you other than the IP address from which you have  accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in  aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the SIS Network, its users, or  to cooperate with law enforcement. We do not collect and evaluate this  information for specific individuals.</p>
<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
<p>From time to time, SIS or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your  computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your  browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A  cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created  by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to  identify which areas of SIS's Network of Web sites you have visited or  customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily  accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many  times you've seen an advertisement. SIS and/or our advertisers may use  this information to better personalize the content, banners, and  promotions that you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept  cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your  browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a  cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your  experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some  features may not work as intended.</p>
<h3>What information do you collect when I register for something?</h3>
<p>SIS offers access to some services that are free but that require  registration. We may use your registration contact information to send  notification of SIS products and services by e-mail and/or postal mail.  We may also use your IP address internally and share it with third  parties for reporting and statistical purposes.</p>
<h3>What other information do you request?</h3>
<p>We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the  purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for  example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or  information about conferences and trade shows). Whenever we request the  identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the  inquiry before the information is requested.</p>
<p>We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new SIS products and  services.  If you choose to supply your postal address in an online  form, you may receive mailings from other third party companies.</p>
<p>When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your  name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and  notify winners.</p>
<h3>What information do you collect when I purchase something?</h3>
<p>If you are purchasing something from SIS, we need to know your name,  e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date.  This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of  your order status. This information may also be used by us to notify you  of related products and services.</p>
<p>Wherever SIS collects personal information we make an effort to  include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.</p>
<h3>Who do we share our information with?</h3>
<p><strong>Companies That Help Deliver SIS Products or Services</strong><br> Sometimes we hire companies to help us deliver products or services  (including processing your transaction, vendor direct shipping, credit  card authorization and fraud prevention).  In those instances, we need  to share your information with these companies. Sometimes we also work  with other companies who assist us in gathering your information in  order to enable us and the other businesses of SIS to provide you  products and services. All of these companies are only allowed to use  your information for delivery of the product or service.<br> <br> <strong>Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</strong><br> On occasion, SIS may share your information with other unrelated outside  third parties selected by us, so that these third parties can directly  market their products or services via e-mail, telephone and/or postal  mail.<br> <br> <strong>Information Sharing Between Affiliates</strong><br> SIS reserves the right to share your personally identifiable  information, including but not limited to your email, postal address,  phone number and purchase history, with its Affiliates. SIS may share  your personally identifiable information with Affiliates in order to  conduct promotions, offer special premiums, and share databases and  equipment. We reserve the right to share your information with other  companies that become Affiliates.<br> <br> <strong>Third-Party Advertisers</strong><br> Once you've clicked on a third-party advertisement and have left our Web  site, our Privacy Policy no longer applies. You must read the privacy  policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be  handled on their site.<br> <br> <strong>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</strong><br> As SIS continually strives to improve our business, from time to time,  SIS may purchase a business or sell one or more of its businesses, and  personally identifiable information regarding you may be transferred as a  part of the purchase or sale.  If SIS purchases a business, the  personally identifiable information received with that business would be  treated in accordance with the privacy policy of that business on the  date of sale. If SIS and/or its units or subsidiaries are ever sold,  acquired, merged, liquidated, reorganized, or otherwise transferred, we  reserve the right to transfer our user databases together with any  personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third-party.   SIS will make reasonable efforts to include provisions in the selling  contract to require the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable  information in the same manner you requested under this Privacy Policy.<br> <br> <strong>Content Partners</strong><br> On some of our sites, we provide content that is created by a  third-party partner Web site. In some instances the third-party sites  will collect information in order to facilitate the transaction or to  make the use of their content more productive and efficient. In these  circumstances the information collected is shared between SIS and our  third-party sponsors.  These third parties will receive your information  because you will be visiting their Web sites or using their links and,  in doing so, you may provide information directly to them. You therefore  should refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle  your information and what kinds of choices you have.<br> <br> On some of our sites, SIS may provide you with a link to the supplier of  that product so that you may get further information. If you link to  the supplier's site, the supplier may collect or receive information  about you.<br> <br> You also may make a purchase from SIS through a link from another Web  site or search engine and may use their express checkout tool to do so.  When you do, please be aware that both SIS and that Web site or search  engine will receive your information.<br> <br> <strong>Mandatory Disclosures Required By Law</strong><br> SIS will disclose personal information and/or an IP address, when  required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is  necessary to:</p>
<ol>
<li> Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process  served on SIS,</li>
<li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the SIS Network of  sites and related properties, or visitors to the SIS Network of sites  and related properties,</li>
<li>Identify persons who may be violating the law, the SIS Terms of  Use Agreement, the rights of third parties, or otherwise misusing the  SIS Network or its related properties,</li>
<li>Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful  activities. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Your Control Over Your Personal Information</h3>
<p><strong>Opt-Out </strong><br> Every communication SIS sends you will contain a clearly worded  "Opt-Out" or "Unsubscribe" link allowing you to withdraw your permission  for future mailings. Please allow five to seven days for processing.  Permission changes will however not affect any information which you  provided to us and which we previously shared with third parties and/or  Content Partners.</p>
<h3>OTHER MATTERS</h3>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong><br> As of January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits  visitors to this Site who are residents of California to request  information regarding SIS's disclosure of their information to third  parties for direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Data Security</strong><br> SIS is committed to doing its best to maintain the security of  information collected on our site.<br> While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from  intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable  efforts to put in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and  managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we  collect.  When you place orders for purchased products or access your  payment information, we use industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer)  encryption technology to protect the storage and transfer of your data  from unauthorized parties. Encryption is a process by which a message or  information is scrambled while it is in transit to our website SSL  codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering  it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. In addition  to our online security efforts, we take steps to protect your personal  data offline, as well. All sensitive information and/or systems that  house that information (i.e., computers or filing cabinet) have  physically restricted access in our offices. Employees are granted  access on a need-to-know basis pursuant to specific job function  requirements (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service  representative). Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our  security and privacy practices through periodic training sessions in an  effort to keep security awareness levels high.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong><br> SIS will occasionally update this Privacy Policy in response to changing  business circumstances and legal developments. SIS encourages you to  periodically review this Policy to be informed of how we are protecting  your information.</p>
<p><strong>Information About Children</strong><br> We are committed to protecting the privacy and rights of children  online. We believe that children should be able to use the Internet in a  safe, productive, and efficient manner and should be afforded the  highest protection available with respect to their personal information.  The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") took effect on  April 21, 2000 and imposes certain requirements on Web sites directed  toward children under 13 that collect information on those children, or  on Web sites that know they are collecting information on children under  the age of 13. It currently is SIS's policy not to collect personal  information on any person under 13. While we do no specifically seek to  obtain information from children, there are areas of our website that  children may visit. To learn more about COPPA, consult the Federal Trade  Commission’s COPPA Web Site <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/" target="blank">www.ftc.gov</a> or you may call 202/FTC-HELP.</p>
<p>By using this web site, you consent to this Agreement and to the  collection and use of information by SIS as specified above.</p>
