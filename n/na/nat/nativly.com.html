                <p>We respect your privacy, and we want you to know how we use the information you provide to us. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to your use of our website located at www.nativly.com (the “Site”) operated by Nativly Group Ltd, 1906 El Camino Real Menlo Park, CA 94027*(“us” or “we”).</p>
                <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting our Site and using our Customer or Partner Service (as defined in Terms of Use and herein collectively referred to as “Services”), you agree that your information, including your personal information, will be handled as described in this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into the Terms of Use.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subtitle">Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We collect personal information and non-personal information from and about you when you use the Services. Specifically, we collect information: (1) directly from you, such as when you contact us, submit a post or submission (2) from third parties, and (3) automatically, as you move through our Site such as Site usage, browser types, IP addresses or device IDs, and other data, as discussed below.</p>
                <p><strong><i>Information We Collect Directly From You. </i></strong>We request information from you when you post a comment or submission, or contact us. Depending upon the particular activity, we may request the following information from you: your name, email address, zip code, gender, age range and so on.</p>
                <p><strong><i>Information We Collect About You From Third Parties.</i></strong> From time to time, we may add the capability to log into our Site through different social networking sites. If you log into our Services through a social networking site, we will request your name and certain basic information. We also may request certain permissions from you, which vary based on the social networking site. For information about how the particular social networking site may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult their privacy policy. We have no control over how a third party social networking site uses or discloses the personal information that you provide to it. We store the information that we receive from the social networking site along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.
                </p>
                <p><strong><i>Information We Collect Automatically.</i></strong>&nbsp;We use cookies, web beacons, Flash, and other automated devices to collect information about you when you visit our Site and our Application. Specifically, we collect the following information about your use of our Site via these technologies: your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; your interaction with the Site; length of time you are logged in to our Site; and websites visited before our Site. With regard to the Application, we may collect your mobile device ID; location and language information; device name and model; operating system type, name and version; your activities within the Application; and the length of time that you are logged into our Application. We will request your information before we collect your location. Please see the section “Use of Cookies, Flash Cookies, HTML5, Web Beacons, and Other Tracking Devices” below for more information about our use of these tracking devices. We may use the information gathered through these methods in anonymous or aggregated form to analyze ways to improve our Services. This information may be associated with your username and may be combined with other information, including personal information that we collect about you.
                </p>
                <p><strong><i>Location Information.</i></strong>&nbsp;We may also may collect your location. We may combine your location information with other information that we have collected about you.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subtitle">Use of Cookies, Flash Cookies, HTML5, Web Beacons, and Other Tracking Devices</h3>
                <p>When you interact with our Services, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We or our third party service providers use cookies, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and similar technologies to track user activity and collect data about our Site, Services, and our users. As stated above, we may combine this data with the personal information we have collected from or about you.</p>
                <p><strong><i>Cookies.</i></strong>&nbsp;We use browser “cookies” on our Site. Cookies are a website’s way of remembering who you are. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer’s hard drive or stored temporarily in your computer’s memory. There are two kinds of cookies, and we use both types of cookies on our Site: “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. Session cookies are deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your computer and retain information for later use tomorrow, next month or whenever they are set to expire. We use cookies to help us to identify account holders and to optimize their experience on our Site. Also, we will use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of this Site. Most Web browsers accept cookies automatically. You can delete cookies manually or set your browser to automatically delete cookies on a pre-determined schedule. If you decline to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of this Site.</p>
                <p>Other companies that place advertising on our Site also have the ability to assign their cookies to you. You can opt out of the collection of certain information about you by many online advertisers. Please see the section below entitled “Advertising” for additional information.
                </p>
                <p><strong><i>Use of Flash Cookies and HTML5.</i></strong>&nbsp;Our Services enable the use of the Adobe Flash Player. Your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates “flash cookies” (also known as “persistent identification elements” or “local shared objects”). The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) uses flash cookies to remember user settings, preferences and usage in a manner similar to the browser cookies referenced above. Flash cookies can store more information than browser cookies and are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser. You can control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash, located at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. (Users running the Windows operating system can generally view flash cookie files in this folder: \Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player. Users running the Apple operating system can generally view flash cookie files in this folder: /users/[username]/Library/Preferences/macromedia/Flash Player. Flash cookies, or LSO files are stored typically with an “.SOL” extension. If you do not allow flash cookies on your computer, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of our Services.
                </p>
                <p>HTML is the software language used for building most of the sites on the internet. Some HTML5 code may allow your responses to advertising and other activities to be monitored across websites, and for such information to be stored on your computer or mobile device and accessed by others you do or have done business with. We assess user activity information stored through this feature of HTML5. As with cookies, other companies that place advertising on our Site may have the ability to access information using this feature of HTML5. We do not control and are not responsible for any such access or for their use of information obtained.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong>&nbsp;Our Web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a Web beacon, which is sometimes also called a “clear gif,” that allows us to monitor and collect certain information about our users, such as the type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time the Web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small or invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page or email, including HTML-based content, can act as a Web beacon. We may use Web beacons to count visitors to our Web pages or to monitor how our users navigate our Site, and we may include Web beacons in email messages in order to count how many of the messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon. We use Web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about our Site and our marketing campaigns.
                </p>
                <p><strong><i>Analytics.</i></strong>&nbsp;Each time a visitor comes to the Site or uses our Application, our servers collect information, including, for example, the visitor’s domain name (e.g., the website that you came from), referral data (e.g., depending on your browser, the address of the last page or series of pages you visited prior to clicking through to our Site), and browser and platform type. We also count, track and aggregate each visitor’s activity as part of our analysis of general traffic flows at our Site (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Site, etc.). We collect some of this data directly, and we also engage third party service providers (e.g., Google Analytics) who use the technologies described in this section, to collect this information and to assist us with our analytics.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subtitle">Security of information</h3>
                <p>We make all reasonable efforts to protect your information. However, no website, Internet transmission, computer system or wireless connection is completely secure.

                <p>We cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.</p>

                    <li>To better understand how users access and use our Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis.</li>

If you are a California resident, you have a right to obtain information about this sharing; please see the Special Notice to California Consumers below. If you respond to an offer and provide information directly to another company, that information will be subject to their privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy.

                <p><strong><i>Aggregate Information.</i></strong>&nbsp;We may disclose aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes, including describing our services to prospective partners and other third parties, such as advertisers, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
