Right to a Personal Representative.&nbsp; You may identify persons to us who may serve as your authorized personal representative, such as a court-appointed guardian, a properly executed and specific power-of-attorney granting such authority, a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care if it allows such person to act when you are able to communicate on your own, or other method recognized by applicable law. We may, however, reject a representative if, in our professional judgment, we determine that it is not in your best interest.</p>
<p>C. You have the right to request access to your health information.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;You have the right to see and obtain a copy of health information that may be used to make decisions about you, such as nurse’s notes, lab tests, prescriptions, and treatment plans.&nbsp; You also may in some cases receive a summary of this health information.&nbsp; You must make a written request to inspect and copy your health information.&nbsp; The request form is available by mail at the address below, can be downloaded from our website, or you may call 614-355-0777 to request a copy.&nbsp; We may charge a reasonable fee for any copies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;In certain limited circumstances, we may deny your request to inspect and copy your health information.&nbsp; For example, you may not read or be given a copy of psychotherapy notes; information collected for use in a civil, criminal, or administrative action, or court case; and certain PHI that is protected by law.&nbsp; In some situations, you may have the right to have this decision reviewed.&nbsp; Please contact the Health Information Management Department at 614-355-0777 if you have questions about access to your medical record.</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have the right to request that we disclose your health information to others.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;If you would like some of your health information sent to someone else, for example to another physician or to your employer, you will need to complete our authorization form indicating that you agree to our disclosing (providing)&nbsp; the information to the others you select.&nbsp; The authorization form is available by mail at the address below, can be downloaded from our website, or you may call 614-355-0777 to request a copy.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Once you authorize us to release your health information, we cannot guarantee that the person to whom the information is provided will not disclose the information. &nbsp;You may take back or "revoke" your written authorization at any time, in writing, by mailing or emailing your revocation to the address below, except if we have already acted based on your authorization. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;If we maintain an electronic health record containing your health information, when and if we are required by law, you will have the right to request that we send a copy of your health information in an electronic format to you or to a third party that you identify.&nbsp; We may charge a reasonable fee for sending the electronic copy of your health information.</p>
<p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have the right to request to amend your health information.</p>
<p>1. You have the right to ask to amend health information we maintain about you if you believe the health information is wrong or incomplete.&nbsp; Your request must be in writing and provide the reasons for the requested amendment.&nbsp; The amendment form is available by mail at the address below, can be downloaded from our website, or you may call 614-355-0777 to request a copy.&nbsp; Mail or email your request to the address listed below.&nbsp; We will review the information as requested and either make the correction or let you know why we think our information is correct.&nbsp; If we deny your request, you may give us a written statement disagreeing with our decision that we will keep with your health information.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have the right to request to receive communications related to your health in another way or at other locations.</p>
<p>1. We normally send your healthcare information to the address and phone numbers you have provided.&nbsp; However, if you would like to have the information sent elsewhere to protect your privacy, you may do so.&nbsp; We will not ask you to explain why you are making the request.&nbsp; We will agree to reasonable requests.&nbsp; To carry out the request, we will ask you for another address or another way to contact you, for example, mailing to a post office box.&nbsp; The confidential communication form is available by mail at the address below, can be downloaded from our website, or you may call 614-355-0777 to request a copy.&nbsp; Mail or email your request to the address listed below or turn in your completed form at any Patient Registration location.</p>
<p>G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have the right to request restrictions on the use and disclosure of your health information.</p>
<p>1. You have the right to ask to restrict uses or disclosures of your health information for treatment, payment, or health care operations.&nbsp; You also have the right to ask to restrict disclosures to family members or to others who are involved in your health care or payment for your health care.&nbsp; Although we may consider your request, please be aware that we are under no obligation to accept it or abide by it unless the request concerns a disclosure of PHI to a health plan for purposes of carrying out payment or health care operations, and the PHI pertains solely to a health care service for which the provider has been paid out of pocket in full. The restriction request form is available by mail at the address below, can be downloaded from our website, or you may call 614-355-0777 to request a copy.&nbsp; Mail or email your request to the address listed below.</p>
<p>2. If you pay out of pocket in full for specific services, you may request that PHI about that service not be disclosed to your health plan.&nbsp; The “Do Not Bill Insurance” form is available by mail at the address below, can be downloaded from our website, or you may call 614-355-0777 to request a copy. Turn in your completed form at any Patient Registration location.</p>
<p>3. We may also have policies on minors that permit your minor child to request certain limits on your access to their health information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>H. You have the right to request an accounting of people to whom we have disclosed your health information. You have the right to receive an accounting of certain disclosures of your health information made by us during the six years prior to your request.&nbsp; This accounting will not include disclosures of information made: (i) for treatment, payment, and health care operations purposes; (ii) to you or pursuant to your authorization; (iii) to correctional institutions or custodial law enforcement officials; (iv) for our patient directory or to person’s involved in your care; and (iv) other disclosures for which federal law does not require us to provide an accounting.&nbsp; The accounting request form is available by mail at the address below, can be downloaded from our website, or you may call 614-355-0777 to request a copy.&nbsp; Mail or email your request to the address listed below.</p>
<p>I. You have the right to express concerns or to ask questions.&nbsp; If you have any concerns about the privacy of your health information or if you have questions about our procedures, you may contact our Privacy Officer at:</p>
