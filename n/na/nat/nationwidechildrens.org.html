We are required to notify affected individuals following a breach of unsecured PHI. We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice, which may be amended from time to time.</p>
<p>

<h2>
	II. To what information does this Notice apply?</h2>
<p>
	Protected Health Information (PHI) is information that you provide us or that we create or receive about your health care.&nbsp; PHI includes a patient’s name, age, race, sex, and other personal health information that may identify the patient.&nbsp; The information relates to the patient’s physical or mental health in the past, present, or future, and to the care, treatment, services and payment for care needed by a patient because of his or her health.</p>
<h2>
	III. Ways We Can Use and Share Your PHI Without Your Written Permission (Authorization)</h2>
<p>
	In many situations, we can use and share your PHI for activities that are common in hospitals. &nbsp;In certain other situations, which we will describe below, we must have your written permission (authorization) to use and/or share your PHI. &nbsp;We do not need any type of permission from you for the following uses and disclosures:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			We must use and disclose your health information to provide that information:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					To you or someone who has the legal right to act for you (your personal representative) in order to administer your rights as described in this Notice; and</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					To the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, if necessary, to make sure your privacy is protected.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Uses and Disclosures for Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations.&nbsp; We may use and share your PHI to provide "Treatment," obtain "Payment" for your Treatment, and perform our "Health Care Operations.”&nbsp; This is what these terms mean:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Treatment.</strong>&nbsp; We use and share your PHI to provide care and other services to you--for example, to diagnose and treat your injury or illness.&nbsp; In addition, we may contact you to provide appointment reminders or information about treatment options.&nbsp; We may tell you about other health-related benefits and services that might interest you.&nbsp; We may also share PHI with other doctors, nurses, and others involved in your care.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Payment.</strong>&nbsp; We may use and share your PHI to receive payment for services that we provide to you.&nbsp; For example, we may share your PHI to request and receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid, your health insurer, HMO, or other company or program that arranges or pays the cost of some or all of your health care ("Your Payor") and to confirm that Your Payor will pay for health care.&nbsp; As another example, we may share your PHI with the person who you told us is primarily responsible for paying for your Treatment, such as your spouse or parent.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Health Care Operations.&nbsp;</strong> We may use and share your PHI for our health care operations, which include management, care coordination, planning, and activities that improve the quality and lower the cost of the care that we deliver.&nbsp; For example, we may use PHI to review the quality and skill of our physicians, nurses, and other health care providers.&nbsp; We may use your PHI to conduct quality assessment and improvement activities, including outcomes evaluation and the development of clinical guidelines.&nbsp; We may also use your PHI to participate in population-based activities relating to improving health or reducing health care costs.&nbsp; Also, we might use your PHI to provide you information on health related programs or products such as alternative medical treatments and programs or about health-related products and services, subject to limits imposed by law.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Disclosures to Your Other Health Care Providers.&nbsp; We may also share PHI with your doctor and other health care providers when they need it to provide Treatment to you, to obtain Payment for the care they give to you, to perform certain Health Care Operations, such as reviewing the quality and skill of health care professionals, or to review their actions in following the law.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Use or Disclosure for Directory of Patients at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.&nbsp; We may include your name, location in the hospital, general health condition and religious affiliation in a patient directory without receiving your permission unless you tell us you do not want your information in the directory.&nbsp; Information in the directory may be shared with anyone who asks for you by name or with members of the clergy; however, religious affiliation will only be shared with members of the clergy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Use or Disclosure for Track Boards and Outside of Patient Rooms.&nbsp; We may write your first name, the first three letters of your last name, and your medical record number on Track Boards at nurse’s stations and/or outside of your room unless you tell us you do not want your information placed there.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Disclosure to Relatives, Close Friends and Your Other Caregivers.&nbsp; We may share your PHI with your family member/relative, a close personal friend, or another person who you identify if we (1) first provide you with the chance to object to the disclosure and you do not object; (2) infer that you do not object to the disclosure; or (3) obtain your agreement to share your PHI with these individuals.&nbsp; If you are not present at the time we share your PHI, or you are not able to agree or disagree to our sharing your PHI because you are not capable or there is an emergency circumstance, we may use our professional judgment to decide that sharing the PHI is in your best interest.&nbsp; We may also use or share your PHI to notify (or assist in notifying) these individuals about your location and general condition.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			To Business Associates that perform functions on our behalf or provide us with services if the information is necessary for such functions or services.&nbsp; Our business associates are required, under contract with us, to protect the privacy of your information and are not allowed to use or disclose any information other than as specified in our contract.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			For Data Breach Notification Purposes.&nbsp; We may use your contact information to provide legally-required notices of unauthorized acquisition, access, or disclosure of your health information.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Fundraising Communications.&nbsp; We may share with our fundraising staff limited demographic information about you (e.g., name, address, other contact information, age, gender, date of birth),&nbsp; including the dates on which we provided health care to you, department of service information, treating physician, outcome information, and health insurance status without your written authorization.&nbsp; We may contact you with information about the importance of contributions to Nationwide Children’s Hospital and invite you to participate.&nbsp; If you do not want to receive any fundraising information in the future, you may opt out of receiving such communications by contacting Nationwide Children’s Hospital Foundation, at 614-355-0888, <a href="mailto:MemberServices@NationwideChildrens.org">MemberServices@NationwideChildrens.org</a>, or 700 Children’s Drive, Columbus OH 43205 or opt out electronically on any email communications.&nbsp;</p>
