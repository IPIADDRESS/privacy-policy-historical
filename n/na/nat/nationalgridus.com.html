<span class="pagehead">Privacy Policy</span>
<br>We are firmly committed to ensuring online user privacy. The following outlines our information-gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.nationalgridus.com.
<p>Because protecting your privacy is important to us, National Grid does not sell, trade, rent, give or distribute information about you to any third party. </p>
<p><b>Security</b>
<br>The form of security that we use is SSL (or Secure Sockets Layer). This is a method of hiding the information that a web browser and a web server send to each other. An SSL-enhanced browser uses encryption to scramble the data you send to a website into an unintelligible string of seemingly random characters. This is the industry standard for encrypting digital communications between any two points across a network. </p>
<p>Most browsers will warn you that you are entering or leaving a secure area by presenting a dialog box. However, most browsers give you the option of turning off the dialog box display.</p> 
<p>When on a secure page, you will see the lock icon on the bottom of your Internet Explorer or Netscape web browser.  Still other browsers have different ways of displaying this information.</p>
<p><b>Online Forms</b>
	<br>We use order forms which allow customers to request information and apply for services.  When applicable, we collect personal contact and identification information (such as your email address and home address). This information is used to answer your questions, solve your problems, and provide interactivity. We do not provide this information to any other parties.</p>
<p><b>Website Cookies</b>
<br>A cookie is a  small text file that is stored on your computer.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on our website.   A session ID cookie is temporary and once you close your browser, the cookie terminates.  A persistent cookie is stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. On our websites, cookies are not used to invade the privacy of internet users.</p>
<p>Our cookies are used to improve the user experience.  Persistent cookies enable us to track website usage  patterns and analyze trends in the aggregate.  This helps us to make nationalgridus.com more useful to visitors.  If users reject this cookie, they will still have full access to our website.  This cookie does not include any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We also use cookies to create a continuous connection to the website.  This type of cookie (a session ID cookie) is only temporary and allows users to fill out and complete a form.
