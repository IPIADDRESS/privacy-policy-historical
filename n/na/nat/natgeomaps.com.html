There are many features on this Web site for which no registration is required. However, if you are interested in obtaining information, products or services from National Geographic, or in participating in certain activities on this Web site (such as making an online purchase, subscribing to one of our magazines, becoming a member of National Geographic, making an online donation to National Geographic, or participating in sweepstakes, contests, surveys, or certain special initiatives), you may need to provide us with information about yourself. For example, if you order a product from us, we ask for your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number and your credit card number. If you are ordering a product as a gift for another person, we will ask you for that person's name, postal address and phone number in order to enable us to deliver the gift to the recipient. If you participate in an activity such as a survey or sweepstakes, we may also ask you to provide other types of information such as gender and personal interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable information. In addition, we may combine personally identifiable information that you have provided to us with other information that is publicly available or that we receive from other reputable sources. <br>
<br>
<strong>Other Information Collected Through Technology</strong><br>
In addition to information you choose to provide to us, we also collect non-personally identifiable information through technology to make our site more interesting and useful to you. For instance, when you come to our site, we collect your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider). Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our visitors visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information that you have provided to us and/or with other information that is publicly available or that we receive from other reputable sources in order to make our Web site and communications more targeted to your interests. <br>
<br>
Our Web site also uses cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer and allow web sites to remember information about users. We use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to enhance the quality of our Web site. We use transient (also called "session ID") cookies to provide continuity from page to page. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We also use persistent cookies. Persistent cookies allow our online store and other parts of our Web site to recognize your browser when you return after your first visit to that part of our Web site. Cookies allow us to personalize your return visits to our site and to save you time during certain activities, such as checking out from our online store. You can choose to remove persistent cookies through your browser options. However, if you do so, your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited, such as our shopping cart feature or online games.<br>
<br>
Finally, our Web site uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including clear gifs (also known as Web beacons). Clear gifs are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We use these technical methods to tell us what parts of our Web site you have visited or to measure the effectiveness of any searches you may do on our site. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information directly to us or to a service provider authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our visitors who have agreed to receive e-mail from us, to determine whether our visitors have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be combined with information that is personally identifiable so that we can make our Web site, and any e-mails you have agreed to receive, more interesting to you.<br>
<br>
</span><a name="Information_Use" title="Information_Use"></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><u>Information Use:</u><br>
National Geographic may use your personally identifiable information to deliver the products and services that you request, enhance your experience on our site, provide you with informational and/or promotional materials that you might find interesting, and for internal business analysis and other business purposes consistent with this policy. These uses may generally be categorized as relationship maintenance uses and promotional uses. We describe these uses in more detail below.<br>
<br>
<strong>Relationship Maintenance Uses</strong><br>
National Geographic uses your personally identifiable information to maintain and manage your account, deliver services that you have requested, and generally enhance your experience on our Web site.

These licensees are restricted by contract from using your personally identifiable information that we share with them for any marketing or promotional purpose that is not related to their National Geographic licensed product or service. To protect your rights, the use of your personally identifiable information by our licensees is subject to the same opt-out rights (and limitations upon those rights) that apply to the use of personally identifiable information by National Geographic and that are described below in the section entitled "Your Choices." However, if you choose to access or purchase a product or service that is offered by one of our licensees, that licensee may in some cases then collect your personally identifiable information subject to its own privacy practices. Because we do not control the privacy practices of our licensees, you should review their practices before you choose to access their products and services.</span></span>

<strong>Co-Branded Partners</strong><br>
National Geographic may share your information with our partners when you engage in certain activities on our sites that they co-sponsor, such as purchasing products or services offered by our partners, electing to receive information or communications from our partners, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by our partners. National Geographic may also share your personally identifiable information when you respond to promotional materials from National Geographic that authorize our partners to use your personally identifiable information for purposes such as sending you additional promotional materials, providing you a product or service, or entering you in a contest, sweepstakes or game. We refer to all these activities and requests as "Co-Branded Activities." When you participate in Co-Branded Activities, you will either be required or asked to agree that the sponsor or partner may use your personally identifiable information in accordance with the sponsor or partner's privacy practices. <br>
<br>
<strong>Subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities</strong><br>
National Geographic has a number of subsidiary and affiliated entities ("Affiliates") that offer a wide range of products and services. One example is NGT, Inc., which operates the National Geographic Channel in the United States. We may share your personally identifiable information with our Affiliates so they can let you know about product and service offerings in which you might be interested. The use of your personally identifiable information by our Affiliates is subject to the same opt-out rights (and limitations upon those rights) that apply to the use of personally identifiable information by National Geographic and that are described below in the section entitled "Your Choices." 
</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Other Third Parties for Promotional Purposes</strong><br>
National Geographic may share your personally identifiable information with other selected third parties so that they may send you promotional materials about goods and services that they offer. When we share your information for promotional purposes, we attempt to select only reputable companies that offer high-quality products and services. You have the opportunity to opt out of our sharing your personally identifiable information with these selected third parties for promotional purposes, as described below in the section entitled "Your Choices." And we will not share your e-mail address with third parties for promotional purposes unless you consent to such sharing by affirmatively agreeing to it on our e-mail newsletter registration page or elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Legal Purposes; Business Transactions</strong><br>
National Geographic may disclose any user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, when we believe that doing so is required by law; may be necessary to protect the property, rights, or safety of ourselves, visitors to our Web sites, or other persons; or will help to enforce any terms of use or contest, sweepstakes, promotions, games or other rules. It may also be necessary to disclose our customers' personally identifiable information to third parties, such as credit card companies, to help resolve disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business. National Geographic may also transfer user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale. 
</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong><br>
National Geographic may share with third parties aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Web site. When we do this, however, we make any personally identifiable information non-personally identifiable by combining it with information about other individuals or by removing characteristics that make the information personally identifiable to you. We share this information in order to improve our Web site and develop content and services that we hope will be of interest to you.&nbsp;
