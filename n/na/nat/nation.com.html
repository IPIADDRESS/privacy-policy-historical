In addition, if you purchase a product or service, Idearc may ask you to provide additional information such as your credit card information, and if you apply for the Superpages Local Serve Program, Idearc may ask you to provide additional information such as your Social Security number. In some cases (for example, if you register with us (or sign-in on This Website) or purchase a product or service), Idearc may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, and security question and answer. <p></p> If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), we will ask for certain personal information from the recipient (e.g., the recipient's name, e-mail address, mobile telephone number) and your name and e-mail address. Idearc uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to facilitate this communication on a one-time basis, and may also store and use such personally identifiable information for analysis purposes (e.g., tracking the success of the referral feature). <p></p> In addition, as you (and other users) browse This Website, our web servers automatically collect certain information about such visits (usually through the use of <a href="#cookies">cookies</a>, javascript tags, clear .gif files (also known as "web beacons"), and the analysis of http headers), such as the user's IP address, the user's domain name, the user's browser type, the user's user agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the links on This Website on which the user clicks. In addition, Idearc collects certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user which are not entered by the user. <p></p> In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code. <p></p> To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future.

For example, we may use such personally identifiable information to assess your credit rating, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), to contact you in connection with user reviews and/or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on This Website, we may also use such personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of such feature. (For example, if you register to use the personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable information you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful service, and if you create a review of a business on Superpages.com, we may publish your initials, city and state in connection with such review.)

For example, we may use your name and e-mail address to send you e-mails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing information about products and services, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm orders placed online and (d) otherwise communicate with you.
