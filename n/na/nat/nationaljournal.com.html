<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#990000">National Journal's Privacy Policy</font></b>
<p>
At National Journal Group we want you to enjoy and benefit from Cloakroom with the comfort and knowledge that we have taken steps to implement fair information practices designed to protect your privacy. The following explains what information we collect about you and how we use it. 
</p><p>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#990000">What We Learn</font></b>
<br>
This site automatically recognizes your domain name, IP address, browser version, operating system and the site you passed through to reach Cloakroom.   In addition, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Cloakroom and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell how many people tuned in to a program. Information you provide to us, such as your name, organization, address, telephone number and e-mail address, are only collected when you complete a request for a free trial or subscribe to a National Journal Group product or service.   

</p><p>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#990000">How We Use What We Learn</font></b>
<br>
The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web sites and to help develop new products.  Also, we compile and use this information so that we may keep you apprised of special offers and new National Journal Group products that may be of interest to you.

</p><p>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#990000">What We Tell Others About You</font></b>
<br>
We do not furnish the information that we automatically gather about you personally to third parties unless we are legally required to do so. We may provide statistical usage data in the aggregate -- never information about you personally -- to our partners about how visitors use Cloakroom.  From time to time, we may also be approached by third parties with an interest in identifying subscribers to National Journal Group publications.  We may provide National Journal Group's mailing list to such third parties if we believe you would be interested  in hearing from them. And in some cases, we may be required by law to disclose  information about you to a third party. 

</p><p>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#990000">Any Questions?</font></b>
<br>
For more information on our Privacy Assurance Policy, contact Greg Hamilton, Marketing Director via e-mail at <a href="mailto:njcirc@njdc.com">njcirc@njdc.com</a>.
