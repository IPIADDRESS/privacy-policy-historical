This form asks for Contact Information, which includes such items as (i) name; (ii) mailing address; and (iii) email address.  The registration process for certain services – for example services relying on credit reports – require a Subscriber to provide Personal Information, including his or her social security number.

<span class="dec-num">3.3.</span><strong>Email Addresses</strong>.  We use your e-mail address to send notifications relating to our Site, and the goods and services you have requested.  In addition, we may use your email address, and other Contact Information, for the uses detailed below.
</li>
<li>
<span class="dec-num">3.4.</span><strong>Contact Information</strong>.  To offer you all the greatest advantages as a Nationalcreditreport.com Subscriber, we find that sharing your Contact Information (expressly excluding your Personal Information), within our Nationalcreditreport.com family of companies and with business partners enables us to offer you personalized products and services at lower costs and/or much greater convenience than otherwise would be possible.  Accordingly, we will provide your Contact Information to our Nationalcreditreport.com family of companies, and to our business partners.  If you would prefer that we not share your Contact Information in this manner, please notify us via our "opt-out" mechanism, described in Section 9 (Your Choices; Opting Out), and we will remove you from this service.

We may share this Contact Information with our affiliates and business partners, as provided in Section 3.4 (Contact Information).
</li>
<li>
<span class="dec-num">3.6.</span><strong>Promotions</strong>.  We believe that our Subscribers' own experiences on the Site can often act as the strongest promotion for our products and services.

You agree that your Contact Information and site-related experiences may be used and adapted for these purposes (without the need for compensation).
</li>
<li>
<span class="dec-num">3.7.</span><strong>Informational Notices and Bulletins</strong>.  Periodically, we may choose to send news, bulletins, or other information to Users, and will use Contact Information to send such communications.

</li>
<li>
<span class="dec-num">3.8.</span><strong>Surveys</strong>.  Periodically, we may initiate surveys on our Site, and we may request Contact Information or other Protected Information from you in connection with such surveys. You are free to choose whether you participate in this type of survey. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and appeal of this Site, and for other business purposes. We will notify you of relevant details in connection with asking for you participation in such surveys.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Credit Report Information Received From Others</strong><p></p>
<p>

Please follow the associated directions, if you wish to obtain free reports directly from the credit bureaus.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Anonymous, Aggregate Information.  </strong><p></p>
<p>
We use Anonymous Information to analyze the effectiveness of our Site, to improve our services, and for other similar purposes.  In addition, from time to time, we may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of the general behavior and characteristics of Users participating in our services and the characteristics of visitors at our Site, and may share Anonymous Information with third parties, including advertisers (if any).  Rest assured, though, that Anonymous Information provided to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal about you.  We may collect Anonymous Information through features of the software that supports our services, through cookies, and through other means described below.
</p>
<ul>

<span class="dec-num">5.1.</span><strong>IP Addresses; Logs</strong>.  Either directly, or through our hosting service provider, we may automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address (the Internet address of your PC), your computer's name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses, where the computer is routing from, and other generally-accepted log information. We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information, which will be aggregated with that of other users in order to understand how our Website is being used, and for security and monitoring purposes.
</li>
<li>
<span class="dec-num">5.2.</span><strong>Cookies</strong>.  A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use a website upon a future visit. We may include cookies on our Website and use them to recognize you when you return to our Website.  You may set your browser so that it does not accept cookies.  Cookies must be enabled on your web browser, however, if you wish to access certain personalized features of our Services.
</li>
<li>
<span class="dec-num">5.3.</span><strong>Tags</strong>.  We may use so-called "pixel tags" — small graphic images (also know as "web beacons", "single-pixel GIFS", or "Web bugs") — for purposes such as (i) to tell us what parts of our website have been visited, (ii) in connection with advertisements we may include on the Site, (iii) to measure the effectiveness of searches you perform on our Site, and (iv) for other purposes. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format you can read, and they inform us whether emails have been opened, to help ensure that our messages are of interest to our Subscribers and other. None of this data includes Protected Information, and you can "opt-out" of receiving these types of emails from us by following the directions provided in Section 9 (Your Choices; Opting Out).  If any Protected Information is collected using such tools, it will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</li>
<li>
<span class="dec-num">5.4.</span><strong>Click-Throughs</strong>.  We may send email messages which use a “click-through URL” linked to content on our Website. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page.

If you prefer not to be tracked simply do not click text or graphic links in the email, or notify us in accordance with Section 9 (Your Choices; Opting Out).
</li>
<li>
<span class="dec-num">5.5.</span><strong>Banner Ads; Advertising Profiles</strong>.  Our Site may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider or advertiser ("Advertisers"). These Advertisers may use traditional banner ads, or other advertising methods, such as advertising using profiles and related content.  An Advertiser may place or utilize its own cookie on your browser, and may use Anonymous Information about your visit to our Site, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. If the Advertiser requests that you provide to it Protected Information, please be aware that this Advertiser's use and collection of this information will be governed by its own privacy policy, and not our Policy.
