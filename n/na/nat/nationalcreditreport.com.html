              <p> Nationalcreditreport.com does not share credit report information 
                except as permitted by law. Credit report information includes 
                all information appearing on your credit report which bears on 
                your creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, personal 
                characteristics, or mode of living and that is expected to be 
                used as a factor in establishing your eligibility for credit or

                carefully selected business partners enables us to offer you personalized 
                products and services at lower costs and/or much greater convenience 
                than otherwise would be possible.</p>
              <p><span class="heading2">Your protection is our priority</span><br>
                We use advanced data-encryption and storage technology to protect

              <p> <span class="heading2">You are protected on the Internet</span><br>
                Unlike many other companies, Nationalcreditreport.com has designed 
                many features of our website to let you anonymously explore various 
                product and service options and other helpful functions, without 
                revealing your identity. The only information we collect is from 
                "cookies" or similar devices, which provide limited 
                data, such as the date, time and areas of our website that were 
                visited. This general information enables us to serve you better 
                by continually improving our website and making it more convenient. 
                Only when you're ready to order one of our products or services 
                do we ask for identifying information, so that we can quickly 
                process your request.</p>
              <p> When you are asked to enter this personal information on our 
                website, our systems automatically switch to "secure" 
                mode. The following security features keep your data safe:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Sophisticated, industry-leading encryption and authentication 
                  technologies</li>
                <li>Website design that blocks or limits online display of customer 
                  information when not necessary to you or the transaction</li>
                <li> IDs and passwords to protect sensitive information</li>
              </ul>
              <p> <span class="heading2">Information we gather and communicate</span><br>
                When you order a product or service from Nationalcreditreport.com, 
                we collect certain data online to verify your identity and process 
                your request. This is to protect you and to help eliminate identity 
                theft and fraudulent orders of credit information.</p>
              <p> In order to offer, provide and improve our products and services, 
                to comply with government regulations, and to better understand 
                your credit-related product and service needs, we collect and 
                maintain a range of customer and former customer data including 
                non-public personal information:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>From applications and other forms (such as your name, phone, 
                  Social Security and account numbers and property address)</li>
                <li> About your transactions with us, our affiliates and our business 
                  partners (such as your loan balance, payment history and other 
                  account information)</li>
                <li> From business partners, vendors and service companies (such 
                  as your credit report from the national credit bureaus)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We are periodically required to disclose some of this data to 
                third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, and federal 
                and state regulators, in order to do business with you. We may 
                also share some of this information with companies that perform 
                services on our behalf (such as the mail house that prepares and 
                mails new product and service offers) and with third parties, 
                as otherwise required or permitted by law (such as to credit reporting 
                agencies or regulators). These business partners contractually 
                agree to keep the information confidential and not use it for 
                any other purpose.</p>
              <p> Additionally, in order to provide you with valuable product 
                and service offerings, we share limited amounts of this non-public 
                personal information (such as a list of customers in a certain 
                age range or geographic location) with well-respected business 
                partners who are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality

                Because we respect your right to privacy, we give you the choice 
                of how your nonpublic personal information, other than credit 
                report information, may be shared. Remember, we do not share credit 
                report information except as permitted by law.</p>
              <p> You may choose to :</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Allow Nationalcreditreport.com to share limited amounts of

                <li> Limit such information sharing within Nationalcreditreport.com. 
                  The process of limiting our ability to share your nonpublic 
                  personal information, other than credit report information, 
                  is called "opting out"</li>
              </ol>
              <p> We provide you three different options to consider, and have 
                a strong commitment to honor your request. They are to:</p>

                <li><strong>Continue receiving valuable and convenient product 
                  and service offers</strong><br>
                  No action is required if you want to enjoy the benefits of valuable 
                  product and service offers by allowing Nationalcreditreport.com 
                  to share limited amounts of your nonpublic personal information,

                <li><strong>Opt out of information sharing outside the Nationalcreditreport.com</strong><br>
                  Making this decision will prevent us from sharing your nonpublic 
                  personal information with our well-respected, carefully screened 
                  business partners. This choice may limit our ability to inform 
                  you of valuable and convenient products and services from partner 
                  companies.<a href="javascript:MM_openBrWindow('optout.cfm?type=Outside','optout','status=yes','400','220','true')">

                  Making this decision will prevent us from sharing your nonpublic 
                  personal information within the Nationalcreditreport.com. This 
                  choice may limit our ability to offer conveniences such as a

              <p>For products and services to multiple consumers, we will treat 
                an opt out by any consumer as applying to all consumers which 
                purchased one of our products or services. Please be aware that 
                even if you decide to opt out, Nationalcreditreport.com will continue 
                to share nonpublic personal information with companies that perform 
                services on our behalf and with third parties as otherwise required 
                or permitted by law as well as share transactions and experience 
                (such as the type of credit-related product you ordered or your 
                payment history with us) within the Nationalcreditreport.com.</p>
              <p> In today's ever-changing, competitive market, opting-out may 
                mean missing timely information about money-saving products and 
                services that help you accomplish your financial goals. It's something 
                to think about carefully. We don't want you to miss any opportunities.</p>

                We will only share information with companies that perform services
