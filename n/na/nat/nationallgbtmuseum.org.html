        		</p><p>The Velvet Foundation (together with its affiliates, successors, and assigns) (“we/us”), care about your privacy and recognize the importance of protecting personal information when you visit velvetfoundation.org and all subdomains (the “Site”). Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, and safeguard the personal information you provide to us, and to assist you in making informed decisions when using the Site. The servers that make the Site available, and databases where information may be stored, may be located outside the country from which you accessed the Site, but we will collect, process, and use personal information only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>1. What Information Is Collected?</strong></p><p>We collect personal information (sometimes referred to as “personally identifiable information”) from our online visitors on a voluntary basis and only in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. This includes, for example, keeping you updated with developments in our mission, requesting volunteer assistance, and soliciting donations. The personal information we ask for is usually your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, and mailing address. If you make a donation to the Velvet Foundation through the Site, we may collect information necessary to effect the donation, including, without limitation, your address, credit card number, security code, and expiration date.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. How Is the Information Collected?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>We collect personally identifiable information via conventional Internet forms. In addition, certain sections of the Site may use “cookies.” Cookies are very small data files left on your computer by the Site. These files can then be accessed by the Site in the future. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions or “Help” screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some portions of the Site may not function properly.</p><p>Like most standard websites, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses and similar data are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p><p>Some of the Sites and Services may contain electronic images called web beacons, sometimes known as one pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, or pixel tags, which allow us to count visitors who have viewed the Site. When we send promotional e-mail messages and newsletters, for example, web beacons allow us to count how many subscribers have read them. Web beacons allow us to develop statistical information about the activities and features that most interest our users for the purpose of providing more personalized content. By setting your browser to display HTML e-mails as text only, you might be able to prevent the use of some web beacons. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Information Usage and Distribution&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>As stated above, we collect personally identifiable information to create or enhance our relationship with you, including, without limitation, to e-mail you with updates, requests for volunteer assistance, and solicitations of donations. Only those who provide us their e-mail addresses will receive follow-up e-mail or other communications from us. We also offer visitors an “opt-out” option at any time they wish to cease receiving e-mails or other information from us (see Section 8 below). We may share information with other trusted third parties who work on behalf of or with the Velvet Foundation under confidentiality agreements.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Legal Disclaimer&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process (including, without limitation, a subpoena) served on the Site or its owner.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Aggregate Information (Non-Personally Identifiable)&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>We may share aggregated demographic information with third parties. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5.

By using the Site, you hereby agree to such transfer or assignment of your personal information collected by the Velvet Foundation, and you further waive any claims that could be made against us in relation thereto.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6.
