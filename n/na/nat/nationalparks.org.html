        The National Park Foundation, publisher of NationalParks.org and its related content and

        <p><b>E-mail</b><br>
        Any/all e-mail addresses sent to us as the result of correspondence with the visitors of
        NationalParks.org will not be used or collected for the purposes of reselling to a third
        party. </p>
        <p><b>Access</b><br>
        The National Park Foundation does not currently collect or archive any/all personal
        information sent to us on an individual basis. All information collected and analyzed
        solely on an aggregated basis. If -- in the future -- The National Park Foundation

        <p><b>Security</b><br>
        All consumer transactions and purchases on this web site are secured using VeriSign
        128-bit SSL encryption. This ensures that all transactions and purchases you send to us
        via the World Wide Web will be encrypted. If any other internet user intercepts the

        <p><b>Cookies</b><br>
        The NationalParks.org web site does not currently use cookies. Our site also does not

        <p><b>Traffic Data</b><br>
        Each time a visitor comes to the NationalParks.org site, information is collected to
        improve the overall quality of the web site. The National Park Foundation collects the
        visitor's domain name/IP Address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from netscape.com or
        yale.edu or 255.255.255.0), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a
        user visited prior to clicking through to NationalParks.org), and browser/platform type

        traffic comes from and how traffic flows within the site). The National Park Foundation
        may merge this information into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated
        basis with potential partners. The National Park Foundation will not disclose your
        individual identity or personal data. When The National Park Foundation does present
        aggregated information to potential partners, no one will be able to identify you or
        contact you. </p>
