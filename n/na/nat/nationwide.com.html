<img alt="Click to verify seal" border="0" hspace="10" src="/images/other/clickseal.gif" vspace="5"></a>Thanks for choosing Nationwide.&nbsp;We
know that protecting your privacy is important.&nbsp;<strong>Our privacy
statement explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your information.
It's for Nationwide customers and visitors of nationwide.com.</strong> If we
change our privacy policy, we’ll post the changes right here. This way you can
always check back to learn what information we collect, how we use it, how we
protect it, and when we might disclose it.</p>

<p>So just how do we protect your privacy?&nbsp;In a nutshell, we promise to
treat your personal information responsibly and provide you with
choices.&nbsp;It’s as simple as that. Here’s how.</p>

<h3>Collecting, using, and sharing visitor information</h3>

<p>Many of our online activities don’t require visitors to register for an
account or give us any personal information.&nbsp;For example, visitors can use
our financial planning guides without giving us any personal information, such
as a name or address.&nbsp;We use Web tools to track how visitors use our Web
site so we can improve your experience.&nbsp;Nationwide and our business
partners use cookies, clear GIFs, and other tools to track visitor’s IP
addresses, domain names, and browser information.&nbsp;These tools don’t
collect a visitor’s personal information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    <em>Cookies</em>
</p>

<p>When you visit nationwide.com, we send cookies – a small file containing a
string of characters – to your computer.&nbsp;Cookies uniquely identify your
Web browser to us.&nbsp;We use cookies to track visitors as they use our Web
site.&nbsp;Most Web browsers are set up to accept all cookies, but you can
change this setting to refuse (disable) all cookies or to tell you when a Web
site is sending you a cookie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also use cookies to create a secure session with customers or visitors
who want to enter or access their personal information.&nbsp;Just remember,
some of our features may not work if you disable cookies.</p>

<p>
    <em>Clear GIFs (Graphic Interchange Format)</em>
</p>

<p>
    <em>A</em> clear GIF is small file that tracks visitors so we can learn how
they use Web ads and Web sites.&nbsp;These GIFs don’t have any personal
information.&nbsp; Some of our business partners use GIFs on Web sites and may
use GIFs provided by DoubleClick.&nbsp;For more information about DoubleClick
or to opt out of their GIF, go to <a href="/nw/content/redirect.x?url=http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/" target="_blank">http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>We collect and use visitor information – which doesn’t have personal
information – so we can: <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>

    <li>Analyze how visitors use our Web site</li>


    <li>Develop new services to improve our Web site &nbsp;</li>


    <li>Analyze our marketing campaigns</li>


    <li>Know how many visitors have seen or clicked on ads</li>

</ul>

<p>Visitors can choose to use tools to tell us what they think about our Web
site.&nbsp;We collect and use the comments that visitors provide to improve our
Web site and your experience.</p>

<p>Nationwide has business partners who help develop or service our Web sites.
They may track and keep visitor information.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Collecting and using your personal information</strong></h3>

<p>We require you to share your personal information with us for some of our
online activities.&nbsp;For example, we collect your personal information so
you can access and service your policies online, apply for products or
services, and ask us questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personal information is any information that identifies you and describes
your relationship with Nationwide.</p>

<p>Some examples of the personal information Nationwide collects are:</p>

<ul type="disc">

    <li>Name</li>


    <li>Address</li>


    <li>Social Security Number</li>


    <li>Driver’s license number</li>


    <li>Policy or account number</li>


    <li>Family member information</li>


    <li>Financial information</li>


    <li>Property address and value</li>


    <li>Consumer report information (credit reports)</li>


    <li>Information from applications and transactions</li>


    <li>Any information you give Nationwide</li>

</ul>

<p>If you apply for a product or service, we may collect personal information
from your consumer reports, such as your credit report or motor vehicle
report.&nbsp; We may also need to collect your medical information.&nbsp;But,
we won’t use or share your medical information for marketing, unless you give
us your permission.</p>

<p>You may choose to use your personal e-mail to correspond with
Nationwide.&nbsp;Please be careful about the information you send to us in
e-mail. As with any public Web tool, your e-mail may not be secure.</p>

</ul>

<h3>
    <strong>Sharing your personal information</strong>
</h3>

<p>We don’t sell your personal information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you buy a product, we may share your personal information with other
Nationwide companies or one of our business partners to service your
product.&nbsp;We also share your personal information with your agent,
investment adviser, investment company, broker-dealer, or transfer agent
affiliates.&nbsp;They use your personal information to manage your policy or
account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We share your personal information for everyday business purposes.&nbsp;Some
examples include mailing your statements or processing transactions that you
request.&nbsp;You cannot opt out of these.</p>

<h3>
    <strong>Sharing your personal information for marketing&nbsp;</strong>
</h3>

<p>We may share your personal information with other Nationwide Companies or
our business partners.&nbsp;We share your personal information with these
companies so we can tell you about other products that might interest
you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes we have a contract with your company or your organization that
prohibits us from sharing your personal information with our other companies
and business partners.&nbsp;In this case, we do not market new products to you,
unless you contact us first and give us your consent.</p>

<p>We have joint-marketing agreements with our business partners.&nbsp; This
means that we have partnered with them to offer you a new product that might
interest you.&nbsp; They may use your personal information to market their
products.&nbsp; If you would like to learn more about opting out, please read
the next section.</p>

<h3>Opt out</h3>

<p>You can ask us not to share your personal information with Nationwide
Companies or our business partners to market new products to you.&nbsp; Just
remember, Nationwide offers many different types of products and
services.&nbsp; You may not want to opt out if you would like to learn about
these products directly from one of our companies.&nbsp; Please call us toll
free at 1-866-280-1809 to opt out of this sharing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>If you have
already opted out, you don’t need to opt out again.</strong></p>

<p>
    <u>Vermont</u> <u>Customers:</u> &nbsp;We won't share your information with
Nationwide Companies or our business partners for marketing purposes without
your consent.</p>

<h3>Confidentiality and security</h3>

<p>We use physical and technical safeguards to protect your personal
information. We limit access to your personal information to those who need it
to do their jobs. The law requires our business partners to use your personal
information only for our purposes. They may not share it or use it in any other
way. We comply with all data security laws.</p>

<h3>Web links</h3>

<p>Other companies or organizations may have links to their Web sites on our
Web pages.&nbsp;We are not responsible for how they collect, use, disclose, or
secure the personal information that you provide to them.&nbsp;Please read
their privacy policy so you can learn how the new Web site uses your personal
information.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>If you are a Nationwide customer, you can ask us to give you a copy of your
personal information.&nbsp;Please send a letter to the address below and get
your signature notarized to prove your identity.&nbsp;This is for your
protection.&nbsp;We don’t charge a fee for giving you a copy of your
information now, but we may charge a small fee in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can call your Agent to change your personal information.&nbsp;We can’t
update information that other companies provide to us.&nbsp;So, you'll need to
contact the other company to correct your information.&nbsp;For example, if you
want to update the information in your credit report, you'll have to contact
the credit-reporting agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>TRUSTe Privacy Program</h3>

<p>Nationwide is part of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.&nbsp;TRUSTe will help you
