<!--header:end-->

<p>You must allow cookies  and pop-up windows to be active on your system to participate in our Program.  Cookies are a feature of the software utilized by your web browser (Internet  Explorer, Netscape Navigator, etc.) that allows web servers to recognize the  computer used to access a website. They are small pieces of data that are  stored by a user's web browser on one website to simplify subsequent  interactions with that website by the same user or to use the information to  streamline the user's transaction(s) on related web pages. The use of cookies  makes it easier for a user to move from website to website and to complete  transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience  easier and more personalized.</p>
<p>Our Site utilizes cookies to collect information  about how our Site is used. Passive Information gathered from cookies may  include the date and time of visits, the Site pages viewed, time spent at our  Site and the websites that you visited just before and just after your visit to  our Site. To find out more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/" target="_blank">www.cookiecentral.com</a>.&nbsp; If you do not wish to transmit  "cookie" information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie  function in your web browser. Please consult the "Help" section of  your web browser in order to correctly turn off or disable the cookie  functions.&nbsp; However, please be advised  that turning off or disabling the cookie functions on your web browser may  prevent our system from properly recognizing you when you visit our Site, and  consequently may make your participation in our Program more difficult or  invalid.</p>
<p>Our Site's servers also  automatically identify your computer by its Internet protocol (“IP”) address,  which is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your  Internet service provider. IP addresses are automatically logged by web  servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP  address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation  of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Internet.  Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting  from, or which ISP you are using. Your IP address may be used to address  problems with our server, administer our Site and/or to gather broad  demographic information about our Members.&nbsp;  Finally, the other websites that you visit have IP addresses, and we may  collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages, as well.</p>

<p class="headline_txt"><b><font size="+1">How Do We Use the Information Collected?</font></b></p>
<!--header:end-->

<p><strong>A) Active Information</strong></p>
<p>Any  Active Information that you submit at the Site remains your property. However,  by submitting that information to us, you grant to us the right, subject  to applicable state and federal law: (1)  to share your Active Information (other  than your Social Security Number-related information) with third party  individuals and entities that we employ directly, or as contractors or agents  at our direction; (2) to share your Active Information (other than your Social Security Number-related  information) with third party advertisers and marketers; (3) to use your  Active Information for purposes of administering our business activities,  including the operation of the Program; (4) to use your Active Information (other than your Social Security  Number-related information) for purposes of providing customer service,  such as support; and (5) to use your Active Information (other than your Social Security Number-related information) in  order to send you information about products and/or services that we, and/or  our third party advertisers and marketers, think may be of interest to you. In  addition, we may use the Active Information and/or Passive Information that you  provide to us to contact you about changes to our Program or Site, the  services, features or products that we or our third party advertisers and  marketers offer and/or other information that we believe that you may find  valuable. If, at any time, you do not wish to receive such information, you may  chose to "opt-out" through the instructions contained in the section  entitled “How Can You Choose Not to Receive Information About Products or  Services” below.</p>
<p>Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise  distribute any and all Active  Information (other than your Social Security Number-related information) with/to any  third-party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable  law.&nbsp; These third-parties may  include, but shall not be limited to, providers of direct marketing services  and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression  and validation, and e-mail marketing.&nbsp; We may also use your Active Information for any Program related purpose, and/or  marketing and survey purpose, on our own behalf and on behalf of our affiliates  and subsidiaries. We may disclose Active  Information to third-party agents and independent contractors that help  us operate the Program.&nbsp; You agree that we may contact you at any time  with updates and/or any other information that we may deem appropriate for you  to receive in connection with your continued use of the Site.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything contained in the  foregoing paragraphs, we will not use your Social Security Number-related  information for any marketing purposes, or transfer same to any third party,  other than to third party sellers where necessary to effectuate the purchase of  products and/or services that you applied for from such third party sellers at  the Site.</p>
<p>Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, by submitting your e-mail address at the Site, you  agree to receive e-mail marketing from us and our third party advertisers and marketers.&nbsp; We, and our third party advertisers and marketers, may  maintain separate e-mail lists for different purposes. If you wish to end your  e-mail subscription to a particular list, you must follow the instructions  contained in each e-mail correspondence that you receive from us,  the applicable third party  advertiser or marketer, to unsubscribe from that particular list. To unsubscribe from  all of our e-mail lists, please follow the instructions set forth in the “How  Can You Choose Not to Receive Information About Products or Services” section below.&nbsp; We only send e-mail marketing to individuals that have  agreed to receive e-mail from us and to individuals that have otherwise agreed, on  third party websites, to receive e-mail marketing from companies such as us. We do not send unsolicited commercial e-mail. As a  result, certain statutes requiring particular formatting for unsolicited  commercial e-mail may not be applicable to the commercial e-mail that is sent  by us.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not send you any e-mail marketing, or  allow any third party to send you e-mail marketing, from which  you cannot unsubscribe.</p>
<p>In addition, you agree that by submitting your  Active Information at the Site, you agree to receive mobile marketing  including, but not limited to, text-message based marketing, from us and our  third party advertisers and marketers.&nbsp;  Notwithstanding that your mobile telephone number may be listed on state  and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right to contact you via  text-message based marketing in accordance with applicable state and federal  law.</p>
<p>We also  reserve the right to release current or past Member/user information (both  Active Information and Passive Information) in the event that: (1) we believe  that the Site is being or has been used to commit unlawful acts; (2) if the  information is subpoenaed or otherwise required in a court proceeding; (3) in  the event that you violate or breach an agreement with the Site including, but  not limited to, this Privacy Policy; (4) in the event that you have submitted  fraudulent or otherwise invalid information to this Site; (5) we believe that  you may harm, or have harmed, the property or rights of us, the Program’s other  Members or any other third party; (6)  if we are sold or acquired; or (7) when we otherwise deem it necessary or  appropriate. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to  disclosure of any record or communication to any third-party when we, in our  sole discretion, determine the disclosure to be appropriate including, without  limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third-parties for  suppression purposes in compliance with the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act of  2003, as amended from time to time (“CAN-SPAM”) or any other applicable state  or federal law, rule or regulation.</p>
<p>In addition, you agree that by submitting your  Active Information at the Site, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry  and/or an application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16  CFR §310 et seq. (the “ATSR”). Notwithstanding that your telephone number may  be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we retain the  right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR. Moreover,  by registering with, making a purchase or requesting information from, a  third-party advertiser at or through the Site, such action shall constitute a  purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the respective third-party  advertiser for purposes of CAN-SPAM and the ATSR and, as such, you may be  contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or telephone by such third-party  advertiser in accordance with CAN-SPAM and the ATSR.</p>

<p>We use Passive Information to gather information  about our Members, to enhance the design and content of our Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet  experience in order to make it easier, faster and friendlier to use.  Additionally, cookies help us learn information concerning how many people  visit our Site, when they visit and how they use our service.

<p class="headline_txt"><b><font size="+1">How do We Secure Active Information and Passive Information?</font></b></p>
<!--header:end-->

<p>We attempt to secure your Active Information and  Passive Information by using reasonable technical efforts to prevent  unauthorized access to, or accidental disclosure, loss or destruction of, such  Active Information and Passive Information. Efforts we may take to ensure the  security of your personal information once it is in our control include, but  are not limited to: (1) maintaining our own servers under our private control;  (2) the use of industry standard encryption software when we transmit and store  sensitive data (including, without limitation, Social Security Number-related information);  and/or (3) monitoring of our network and servers for intrusion. However, as all  Internet transmissions may pass through many servers not controlled by us, we  cannot guarantee that any information that you provide to us or that we collect  will not be intercepted or altered in that process.&nbsp; Communications that you may have with us via  text messaging, email or regular mail may not be secure unless we advise you  that security measures are in place prior to your sending such information.  Therefore, if you choose to communicate with us through these means, you are  assuming the risk of doing so and we request that you do not send or post  sensitive information through these means. Access to your Active Information  and Passive Information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the  public.&nbsp; All of our Members' information, not just the  sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only  employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example a  customer service representative) are granted access to Active  Information and Passive Information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and  privacy of all of our Members’ information. Employees not adhering to our firm  policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable  federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory  agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with  respect to your Active Information and Passive Information. You will be  notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that  notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement,  determine the scope of network damage and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
