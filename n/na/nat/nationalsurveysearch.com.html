                      identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive 
                      through your web browser. Information we collect and analyze 
                      via cookies includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address

                  Iron Traffic Inc. periodically sends e-mail offers to its web

                  first e-mail you receive and click on the opt-out link provided, 
                  which will remove your e-mail address from our database. You 
                  will then receive no further e-mail communications from us. 
                  If you do not scroll down to the bottom of the first e-mail
