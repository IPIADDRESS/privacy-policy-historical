			Financial Media uses cookie information it receives by placing the cookie on user's hard drive to improve the efficiency
			of customer service on our online subscription based sites, allowing subscribers to easily change addresses, and
			add or cancel subscriptions by automatically verifying that you are a subscriber. Thomson Financial Media also

			operate the servers on which the ads reside. Although Thomson Financial Media requests such parties to adhere to

			<p><font size="2">Thomson Financial Media collects personal identifying information, when such information is specifically
			and knowingly provided, from users during (i)contest, survey, sweepstakes or site registration promotions, and
			(ii) subscription registration for sites or services requiring such registration information. Thomson Financial
			Media may use this information for marketing and promotional purposes. Thomson Financial Media occasionally informs
			our users of special deals, new products, and other third party product and service offers that we believe our
			users will find interesting. Users are given the option to choose whether they would like to receive such mailings
			upon registration. Individual users can request, at any time, that their information not be used for such purposes
			by sending an e-mail request to Thomson Financial Media at the address given above.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2">Although it does not currently rent lists of users, Thomson Financial Media may decide in the
			future to offer companies and organizations that have a product or service believed to be of interest to the user
			the opportunity to rent our list. Thomson Financial Media may share a user's personally-identifiable information
			with these companies in an effort to help locate these resources. Thomson Financial Media will, however, offer
			the user the opportunity to "opt out" of having their personally-identifiable information shared with
			third parties that are not affiliated with Thomson Financial Media.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2">If a Thomson Financial Media user knowingly provides personal information such as a user name
			or e-mail address in a chat or bulletin board area, that user should be aware that the information provided can
			be collected and used by others in that area.</font></p>
