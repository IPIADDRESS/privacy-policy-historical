As a result, data you submit to our Digital Offering such as credit card and payment information is transmitted using commercially reasonable security over the Internet. This Digital Offering also uses password encryption to ensure your privacy when registering for newsletters, events, and other SourceMedia related media. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect through all channels. We maintain a secure process to collect, transmit, and store your personally identifiable information. When you provide credit-card information online, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and therefore we cannot warrant or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy. Subscribers can review or change online subscription or credit-card information at any time at My Account. We urge you to keep your online password in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This ensures that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place, such as a library or Internet cafe. Notification of Changes SourceMedia reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Digital Offering. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Digital Offering. Please check back often to review the latest version of our Privacy Policy. Your Acceptance of these Terms By using our Digital Offering, products or services, you signify your acceptance of the terms of the SourceMedia Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of the SourceMedia Privacy Policy, please do not use the Digital Offering, products and/or services and exit the Digital Offering immediately. Your rights You have the right to request us not to disclose any of your personal data or information or to pass information to third parties. We will usually inform you before collecting your data. You can also notify us by contacting us at custserv@sourcemedia.com. The Digital Offering may from time to time contain links to and from partner and/or affiliate websites. If you follow a link to their sites, please note that these sites have their own privacy policy and that SourceMedia does not accept any responsibility or liability for protection of personal data which you may submit to a third party's site. You are recommended to check the wording of the relevant privacy policies before you submit any personal data to those sites. In The Event of Sale or Bankruptcy The ownership of SourceMedia may change at some point in the future. Should that occur, we want to be able to maintain a relationship with you. In the event of a sale, merger, public offering, bankruptcy or other change in control of SourceMedia your information may be shared with the person or business that owns or controls this site. Opting out of receiving information from third parties will not affect our right to transfer your information to a new owner, but your choices will continue to be respected regarding the use of your information. You will be notified as described below in “Changes to Privacy Policy.” Changes to Privacy Policy SourceMedia may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by posting a prominent notice in our privacy policy or in other locations on our Web site or by sending you an email to inform you of our updated privacy policy.
