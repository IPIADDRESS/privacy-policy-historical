We recommend that you carefully read our Privacy Policy whenever you visit our Site. Pharmavite will use your personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent to the new or revised policy.</font><br><br>
						<font class="font12B"><a name="2"></a><i>THIS SITE IS INTENDED FOR ADULT USE </i></font><br><br>
						<font class="font10">This Site is not designed or intended to attract persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not use this Site. We do not collect personal information from any person we know is under the age of 18. <b>By using this Site, you acknowledge that you are 18 years or older.</b></font><br><br>
						<font class="font12B"><a name="3"></a><i>INFORMATION WE COLLECT </i></font><br><br>
						<font class="font10"><b><u>Personally Identifiable Information </u></b><br><br>
Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to identify you personally, and it may include your name, e-mail address, and street address. We may also ask you for or give you the opportunity to supply other information about yourself, such as your age, gender, and similar information (including weight, height and health related information). We may collect this information in one or a variety of ways, including: 
<ul>
<li>when you create a Wellness Account; 
</li><li>when you use various interactive tools and services, such as the Wellness Advisor or the "Email an Expert" feature on naturemade.com; 
</li><li>when you participate in surveys, sweepstakes or contests or respond to questionnaires and the like; 
</li><li>when you make submissions to us, such as your success story or testimonial; 
</li><li>when you participate in any special offers or coupons being offered; 
</li><li>when you request information from us, including general or product inquiries;
</li><li>when you contact us; or
</li><li>when you e-mail a page from this Site to a friend.  Please note that in this situation the e-mail addresses you or your friend supply to us will not be used to send 
</li></ul>
you or your friend other e-mail communications unless disclosed at the time you provide the information. 
You can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Site's features, such the interactive content provided on this Site. <b>If you provide us with your personally identifiable information you are consenting to our use and disclosure of such information consistent with this Privacy Policy and the <a href="/UserAccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp" class="afont10line">Terms and Conditions</a>.</b>
<br><br>
We may also receive information about you from other sources. For example, we may collect information about you in connection with a promotion offered on a third-party web site or you may provide information to another Pharmavite web site or offline to Pharmavite.  We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information that we collect through this Site.  In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personally identifiable information that we receive.
<br><br>
You are responsible for the accuracy of your personally identifiable information. You submit the information; Pharmavite retains it as received. When you update or correct your personally identifiable information, such updated and corrected information is also retained by Pharmavite as received.
<br><br>
<b><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information </u></b>
<br><br>
We also collect non-personally identifiable information from you through the use of technology, which may include "cookies" and pixel tags (or clear "gifs"). Because of the nature of such technology, it may not be apparent to you that such non-personally identifiable information is being collected. For example, our web server will typically collect the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the lengths of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting the Site, and IP addresses.
<br><br>
<b><u>IP Addresses</u></b>
<br><br>
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to you whenever you access the Internet and is often associated with the place where you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. This IP address may be the same each time you access the Internet or it may change. We may associate your IP address with the personally identifiable information you provide.  In addition, we may use your IP address to identify you in cooperation with internet service providers or law enforcement at their request or when we feel necessary to protect the site or the public.
<br><br>
<b><u>Cookies; Pixel Tags, and Similar Technologies</u></b>
<br><br>
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer and puts on your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the web site. "Cookies" tell us how often someone visits our Site and the activities they conduct while on our Site (such as the places you visited, etc.). "Cookies" can also be used to store personal preferences for your convenience and to track user trends and patterns. The information collected by "cookies" can help us better understand and improve areas of this Site and our products that our users find valuable.
<br><br>
Cookies alone do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information. Nevertheless, once you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information, we may combine it with information collected by the cookie.
<br><br>
Your browser software can be set to reject all "cookies" or to warn you each time a cookie is being sent. You do this through your browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to reject "cookies" or receive warnings about "cookies." If you reject our "cookies," some of our Site's functionality may not work properly. 
<br><br>
The Site or our e-mail messages may also use pixel tags, which are also called clear "gifs" (or  similar technologies as they become available), which are small graphic images that allow the party that set the pixel tag to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of a web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the pixel tag, the IP address of the computer that the pixel tag is sent to and the time the pixel tag was viewed.  We use the information collected by pixel tags for a variety of internal purposes, such as targeting future advertising campaigns, upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics, and to count how many e-mail messages that we sent were actually read. We may combine the information we collect in this way with your personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
Third-party advertisers or content providers on this Site may also set their own "cookies" or pixel tags. Pharmavite does not control these third parties' use of these technologies or how they manage the information they gather through them.  
<br><br>
<b><u>Embedded Code </u></b>
<br><br>
We use a tracking utility called WebTrends On Demand™ which uses IP addresses and codes embedded in our Site to gather non-personally identifiable information about Site usage and movement. This data is then analyzed and used for improving user experience and promoting our products. You should refer to the WebTrends On Demand Privacy Policy to learn how they collect and use information.
