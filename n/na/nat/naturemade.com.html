						                        <font class="font10"><b><u>Personally Identifiable Information </u></b><br><br>
Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to identify you personally, and it may include your name, e-mail address, and street address. We may also ask you for or give you the opportunity to supply other information about yourself, such as your age, gender, and similar information (including weight, height and health related information). We may collect this information in one or a variety of ways, including: 
<ul>
<li>when you create a Wellness Account; 
</li><li>when you use various interactive tools and services, such as the Wellness Advisor or the "Email an Expert" feature on naturemade.com; 
</li><li>when you participate in surveys, sweepstakes or contests or respond to questionnaires and the like; 
</li><li>when you make submissions to us, such as your success story or testimonial; 
</li><li>when you participate in any special offers or coupons being offered; 
</li><li>when you request information from us, including general or product inquiries;
</li><li>when you contact us; or
</li><li>when you e-mail a page from this Site to a friend.  Please note that in this situation the e-mail addresses you or your friend supply to us will not be used to send 
</li></ul>
you or your friend other e-mail communications unless disclosed at the time you provide the information. 
You can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Site's features, such the interactive content provided on this Site. <b>If you provide us with your personally identifiable information you are consenting to our use and disclosure of such information consistent with this Privacy Policy and the <a href="/UserAccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp" class="afont10line">Terms and Conditions</a>.</b>
<br><br>
We may also receive information about you from other sources. For example, we may collect information about you in connection with a promotion offered on a third-party web site or you may provide information to another Pharmavite web site or offline to Pharmavite.  We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information that we collect through this Site.  In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personally identifiable information that we receive.
<br><br>
You are responsible for the accuracy of your personally identifiable information. You submit the information; Pharmavite retains it as received. When you update or correct your personally identifiable information, such updated and corrected information is also retained by Pharmavite as received.
<br><br>
<b><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information </u></b>
<br><br>
We also collect non-personally identifiable information from you through the use of technology, which may include "cookies" and pixel tags (or clear "gifs"). Because of the nature of such technology, it may not be apparent to you that such non-personally identifiable information is being collected. For example, our web server will typically collect the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the lengths of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting the Site, and IP addresses.
<br><br>
<b><u>IP Addresses</u></b>
<br><br>
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to you whenever you access the Internet and is often associated with the place where you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. This IP address may be the same each time you access the Internet or it may change. We may associate your IP address with the personally identifiable information you provide.  In addition, we may use your IP address to identify you in cooperation with internet service providers or law enforcement at their request or when we feel necessary to protect the site or the public.
<br><br>
<b><u>Cookies; Pixel Tags, and Similar Technologies</u></b>
<br><br>
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer and puts on your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the web site. "Cookies" tell us how often someone visits our Site and the activities they conduct while on our Site (such as the places you visited, etc.). "Cookies" can also be used to store personal preferences for your convenience and to track user trends and patterns. The information collected by "cookies" can help us better understand and improve areas of this Site and our products that our users find valuable.
<br><br>
Cookies alone do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information. Nevertheless, once you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information, we may combine it with information collected by the cookie.
<br><br>
Your browser software can be set to reject all "cookies" or to warn you each time a cookie is being sent. You do this through your browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to reject "cookies" or receive warnings about "cookies." If you reject our "cookies," some of our Site's functionality may not work properly. 
<br><br>
The Site or our e-mail messages may also use pixel tags, which are also called clear "gifs" (or  similar technologies as they become available), which are small graphic images that allow the party that set the pixel tag to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of a web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the pixel tag, the IP address of the computer that the pixel tag is sent to and the time the pixel tag was viewed.  We use the information collected by pixel tags for a variety of internal purposes, such as targeting future advertising campaigns, upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics, and to count how many e-mail messages that we sent were actually read. We may combine the information we collect in this way with your personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
Third-party advertisers or content providers on this Site may also set their own "cookies" or pixel tags. Pharmavite does not control these third parties' use of these technologies or how they manage the information they gather through them.  
<br><br>
<b><u>Embedded Code </u></b>
<br><br>
We use a tracking utility called WebTrends which uses IP addresses and codes embedded in our Site to gather non-personally identifiable information about Site usage and movement. This data is then analyzed and used for improving user experience and promoting our products. You should refer to the WebTrends Privacy Policy to learn how they collect and use information. You can find WebTrends  privacy policy at: <a href="http://www.webtrends.com" target="_blank" class="afont10line">http://www.webtrends.com</a></font><br><br>

Please review our restrictions on use and guidelines for public forums in our <a href="http://www.naturemade.com/UserAccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp" class="afont10line">Terms and Conditions</a>. <b>Please remember that any information (including personal and medical information) that you reveal in a public forum on this Site becomes public information and is not protected by this Privacy Policy.</b>  In addition, certain message boards (and similar user forums) may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message.  Pharmavite is not responsible for the actions or policies of any third parties who collect and disclose information that you may provide in forums or other public areas of this Site.  If you are asked to create a user name, you may not wish to use your real name or other information that can be used to identify you.  In addition, do not use the real name of another person when selecting a user name.

<br><br>
If you do not opt-out of receiving information from the Site, we use the information collected to communicate with you and to promote Pharmavite's products. For example, we may use such information to send you e-mail updates and newsletters about our products, to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you, including e-mails relating to your health interests, or to send you e-mail promotions and special offers from us, our advertisers, third-party business partners, or other third parties.

If we chose to publish such information (including your photograph and/or likeness and any health related information in your submission), we may also publish your name, screen name and other related information on our Site; you should review our <a href="http://www.naturemade.com/UserAccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp/UserAccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp" target="_blank" class="afont10line">Terms and Conditions</a> as to the rights that you are giving us by making any such submission. 
<br><br>
We use non-personally identifiable information that we collect or that is collected by WebTrends On Demand for internal purposes, such as to analyze Site usage and movement, to improve the design, content and offerings of our Site and to personalize your Internet experience. We may share non-personally identifiable information about our users, such as aggregate statistics, with advertisers, third party business partners and other third parties. </font><br><br>

Any information provided to such entities will be treated by those entities in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
Pharmavite does not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for those third parties' marketing purposes.  Pharmavite discloses personally identifiable information to third parties in the limited circumstances set forth below or as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy or at the time you provide your information: 
<br><br>
<b><u>Disclosure to Service Providers, Operations and Maintenance Contractors</u></b>n
<br><br>
We may contract with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of the services necessary to operate and maintain this Site, sending e-mail, promotions, and advertising.  These third party vendors may be supplied with or granted access to personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf. 
<br><br>
<b><u>Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions</u></b>
<br><br>
On occasion, we offer promotions --like sweepstakes or contests--by ourselves or in conjunction with a third party sponsor. If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, your personally identifiable information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list.  Winners' information, such as name, city and state may be posted on the Site. Also, by entering a sweepstakes or contest, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern such promotions. These rules may dictate specific obligations such as allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice, or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with a sweepstakes or contest.   Any personally identifiable information collected solely in connection with participation in a sweepstakes will not be used in connection with surveys or polls.
<br><br>
<b><u>Disclosures Made in Connection with Sale of a Business </u></b>

User Information may be transferred in connection with the sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Pharmavite or its subsidiaries, or as the result of other fundamental corporate change.
