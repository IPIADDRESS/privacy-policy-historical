		<br><br>
<font class="font10">
Pharmavite® LLC., maker of Nature Made®, Nature's Resource®, SAM-e, Optimize®, and JogMate® products, thanks you for visiting our site.  Your privacy is important to us.  This privacy policy discloses how we collect, protect, use, and share information gathered about you on this site.  We urge you to read this policy carefully.  We hope that this disclosure will give you a clear understanding of how we handle your personal information and will help increase your confidence in our site.  By using this site, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.  This privacy policy is in addition to our Terms and Conditions, which we urge you to read.
<br><br>
This policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.
<br><br>
<b><i>POLICY CHANGES</i></b>
<br><br>
This privacy policy may be revised periodically.  The date of the policy is noted under the "Privacy Policy" heading above. Your use of this site after any change to the privacy policy will be governed by such revised privacy policy. Therefore, we recommend that you read our privacy policy whenever you visit our site.
<br><br>
<b><i>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</i></b>
<br><br>
The majority of great products and services on our site are offered without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can surf this site and view much of our terrific content anonymously. 
<br><br>
<b><u>Personally Identifiable Information </u></b> 
<br><br>
We collect only the personally identifiable information you provide to us voluntarily.  This information includes your name, age, gender, e-mail address, address, telephone number, and any other information you provide to us (including weight, height and health related information).  When you purchase products from us, we will also collect your billing address and your credit card number.  We collect this information in the following ways: 
<ul>
<li>when you register with us by creating a Wellness Account;  
</li><li>when you choose to use our various interactive tools and services, such as the Wellness Advisor or by utilizing the "Email an Expert" feature on naturemade.com,
</li><li>when you participate in surveys, sweepstakes or contests or respond to questionnaires and the like;
</li><li>when you make submissions to us, such as your success story or testimonial;
</li><li>when you purchase our products online;
</li><li>when you participate in any special offers or coupons being offered; 
</li><li>when you request information from us, including by making general inquiries, or product inquiries; or
</li><li>when you contact us.

</li></ul>
When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form or you will have initiated a communication with us, such as sent us an e-mail. 
<br><br>
You will not be able to utilize the interactive portions of our website unless you register with us by creating a Wellness Account. The personally identifiable information required to access each interactive portion of the web site may be different and is noted where the information is collected. 
<br><br>
<b>You should review "Jurisdictional Limitations" in the <u>Terms and Conditions for jurisdictional limitations related to the information provided, and sweepstakes, coupons, promotions and programs offered, through this site.</u></b>
<br><br>
<b><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u></b>  
<br><br>
We also collect non-personally identifiable information from you through the use of technology, which may include "cookies" and pixel tags (or clear "gifs").  Because of the nature of such technology, it may not be readily apparent to you that such non-personally identifiable information is being collected. For example, when you come to this site your IP (internet protocol) address is collected.  An IP address is automatically assigned to you whenever you access the Internet and is often associated with the place from which you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. This IP address may be the same each time you access the Internet or it may change.  The information we collect in this manner is not personally identifiable. However, once you choose to furnish us with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to such information.
<br><br>
<b><u>Cookies; Pixel Tags</u></b>
<br><br>
Pharmavite® LLC. reserves the right at any time to collect anonymous, non-personal information about your use of this site through the use of  "cookies" and pixel tags.  
<br><br>
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer and puts on your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the Web site. "Cookies" allow us to know how often someone visits our site and the activities they conduct while on our site (such as the places you visited, etc.).  "Cookies" can also be used to store personal preferences for your convenience and to track user trends and patterns.  The information collected by "cookies" can help us better understand and improve areas of this site and our products that our users find valuable.
<br><br>
Cookies alone do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information.  However, once you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information, such information may be linked to the data stored in the "cookie."
<br><br>
Your browser software can be set to reject all "cookies" or to warn you each time a cookie is being sent.  You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to reject "cookies" or receive warnings about "cookies."  If you reject our "cookies," certain of the functions and conveniences of our site may not work properly, but you do not have to accept our "cookies" to productively use our site. 
<br><br>
Sponsors, partners or advertisers on this site may also use their own "cookies" when you click on their advertisement or link to their site or service.  Pharmavite® LLC. does not control these third parties' use of "cookies" or how they manage the information they gather from your visit to their sites.  We recommend that you review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our site for information on how these other sites use "cookies" and your personal information. 
<br><br>
In addition, visitors to our site who have received a targeted promotional campaign from Pharmavite® LLC. or its third party advertising company, may have some of the pages they visit on our site noted by us or by such company through the use of pixel tags (also called clear "gifs").  The information collected in this way may be associated with personally identifiable information.  The information collected by pixel tags is used for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics.
<br><br>
<b><u>Imbedded Code</u></b>
<br><br>
We use a tracking utility called WebTrends Live™ that uses a users IP address and code imbedded in our site to gather non-personally identifiable information about web site usage and movement.  This data is then analyzed and used for improving user experience and promoting our products.  You should refer to the WebTrends Live Privacy Policy to learn how they collect and use information.  You can find WebTrends Live's privacy policy here:<br> <a href="http://www.webtrendslive.com/privacy_policy.htm" target="_blank" class="afont10">http://www.webtrendslive.com/privacy_policy.htm</a>
<br><br>
<b><u>This Site is Intended for Adults</u></b>
<br><br>
This site is not designed or intended to attract persons under the age of 18.  We do not collect personal information from any person we actually know is under the age of 18.  <b>By using this site, you acknowledge that you are 18 years or older.</b>
<br><br>
<b><i>PUBLIC FORUMS</i></b>
<br><br>
As a service to our users, this site may feature chat rooms, message or discussion boards and forums.  <b>Please remember that any information (including personal and medical information) that you reveal in a public forum on this site becomes public information and is not protected by this privacy policy. </b>
<br><br>
<b><i>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</i></b>
<br><br>
Pharmavite® LLC. uses personally identifiable information in a variety of ways. We use the information to complete transactions, such as to fulfill you requests for our products, programs and services (including without limitation creation of your nutrition calculators, health calculators and prevention calculators on <a href="http://www.naturemade.com" target="_self" class="afont10">www.naturemade.com</a>) and to respond to your inquiries. We also use the information collected to communicate with you and to promote Pharmavite® LLC. and Pharmavite® LLC.'s products.  For example, we may use such information to notify you if you've won one of our sweepstakes or contests, to contract you in connection with your Wellness Rewards account, to send you e-mail updates and newsletters about our site and our other sites, to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you, including e-mails relating to your health interests, or to send you e-mail promotions and special offers from us or our advertisers, third-party business partners or sponsors or other third parties.  
<br><br>
We and our third party advertiser, business partners sponsors and others will send you e-mail updates and/or newsletters about our sites, products, programs or service offers or promotions unless either (i) you specifically chosen to opt out of receiving such e-mails  by unchecking the "opt in" option on any form submitted to us at the time your register with us, request information from us or otherwise contact us, or (ii) you have previously requested or later request that we remove your name from our mailing list. 
<br><br>
If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g. your success story with our product, your testimonial regarding our product, and/or your photograph), we may or may not publish such submission.  If we chose to publish such information (including your photograph and/or likeness and any health related information in your submission), we may also publish your name, screen name and other related information on our sites; you should review our <a href="/useraccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp" class="afont10" target="_self">Terms and Conditions</a> as to the further rights you are giving us by making any such submission.
<br><br>
We also use your personally identifiable information in combination with the personally identifiable information of others to create non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate form. For example, we may collect, aggregate and use demographic information, such as the number of visitors of a certain age or the number of visitors from a certain region of the country, to improve the content of our sites and to promote Pharmavite® LLC. and Pharmavite® LLC.'s products.
<br><br>
We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect or that is collected by WebTrends Live to analyze site usage and movement, to improve the design, content and offerings of our sites, to personalize your Internet experience and to promote Pharmavite® LLC. and Pharmavite® LLC.'s products.  We may also share aggregate non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers, third party business partners, sponsors and other third parties.
<br><br>
We may use a third-party advertising company to deliver ads when you visit our sites.  This company may use information  about your visits to our and other web sites, in combinations with non-personally identifiable information about your purchases and interests from other online and offline sources, in order to provide advertisements about Pharmavite® LLC. goods and services of interest to you.  In addition, we share web site usage information about visitors to our sites, including those who have received a targeted promotional campaign, with this company for the purposes of managing and targeting advertisements relating to Pharmavite® LLC. products and services and for market research analysis on this site and our other sites.  For these purposes, as disclosed earlier, we and our third-party advertising company may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).  In the course of delivering advertisements to this site, our third party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer.

<b>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION </b> 
<br><br>
Other than for success stories, testimonials, and/or photographs that you may submit to us (which may be published and publicly disclosed as noted earlier in this Privacy Policy and in our Terms and Conditions), Pharmavite® LLC. does not disclose to third parties any identifying personal information we collect from you: 
<ul>
<li>except as described in this Section (Disclosure of Your Information) with respect to personal information that is not health related; personal health information, that is information that could be used to identify or contact you which is combined with any information on your health, is not disclosed to third parties other than subsidiaries except in the instances described in the following three bullet points;
</li><li>in connection with the sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition of all or a portion of our business or of our subsidiaries;
</li><li>unless we believe in good faith that we are required to disclose such information pursuant to applicable law or legal process (like a subpoena or court order); or
</li><li>except in special cases, such as when we believe in good faith that you have violated a law, rule or regulation (for example, fraud in the use of the Wellness Rewards Program) or that there exists a physical threat to you or others.   
</li></ul>
Except for disclosures pursuant to law or legal process or in the special cases noted above, when we disclose your personal information to third parties, we will ask such third parties to keep the information confidential and to use the information only for the purpose provided and in accordance with this privacy policy.  
<br><br>
Non-personally identifiable information, including health related and non-health related aggregated data, may be disclosed to third parties for a variety of purposes, including improving the content of our sites, the services we offer you and promoting Pharmavite® LLC. and Pharmavite® LLC.'s products.
<br><br>
<b><u>Disclosure to Subsidiaries</u></b>
<br><br>
Pharmavite® LLC. may disclose your information to entities wholly-owned by us.  Any information provided to such entities will be treated by those entities in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy.
<br><br>
<b><u>Disclosure to Service Providers, Operations and Maintenance Contractors</u></b>
<br><br>
Sometimes we hire companies to help us deliver products or services, like our fulfillment house that sends you our products or special offers or a service provider that may send you other communications from us, including e-mail communications from us.  In those instances, we need to share your information with them. Access to your personal information by these companies is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for them to perform such functions.  These companies are allowed to use your personal information only to deliver the coupon/product or service. 
<br><br>
Also, sometimes our operations and maintenance contractors have limited access to your information in the course of providing products or services to Pharmavite® LLC.  These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services and/or content related to the better maintenance and operation of our sites.  Access to your personal information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the contractor to perform its service for Pharmavite® LLC.  We require that our operations and maintenance contractors protect the privacy of your personal information consistent with this privacy policy and not use or disclose or use your personal information for any purpose other than providing us products and services.
<br><br>
<b><u>Disclosure to Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</u></b>
<br><br>
On occasion, we offer promotions -- like sweepstakes -- in conjunction with a sponsor. We will share your information with the sponsors if they need it to send you a product. We may also share your information with those sponsors or other business partners so that they can send you other special promotions they offer related to Pharmavite® LLC., unless you have "opted-out" of receiving such promotions (see "Your Privacy Choices" below). In addition, Pharmavite® LLC. occasionally sends e-mail promotions out to our consumers on behalf of third-party sponsors, such as our retailers, relating to our products and services. In this instance, we don't share your name with the third party -- we do the mailing for them. Again, you will receive these promotions unless you have "opted-out" of receiving such promotions (see "Your Privacy Choices" below). <br><br>
<b><u>Disclosures Made in Connection with Sale of a Business</u></b>
<br><br>
Your information may be transferred in connection with the sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Pharmavite® LLC. or its subsidiaries.
<br><br>
<b><u>Disclosures Made in Connection with Credit Card Sales</u></b>
<br><br>
If you use a credit card to purchase any product from us, we will disclose to the company that issued your credit card and others your personally identifiable data to the extent necessary to process the credit card charges.  
<br><br>
<b><u>Disclosures Required by Law or in Special Cases</u></b>
<br><br>
Again, we will give out personally identifiable information to comply with valid legal requirements, such as a law, regulations, search warrant, subpoena or court order, to enforce our <a href="/useraccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp" class="afont10" target="_self">Terms and Conditions,</a> or to protect the safety and security of consumers and our sites.
<br><br>
<b>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTY SITES </b>
<br><br>
For your convenience, Pharmavite® LLC. may also at times have links to websites operated by companies other than Pharmavite® LLC.  These links may be placed beside the name or logos of sponsors, referenced in content or found in advertisements. 
<br><br>
You should be aware that any information you disclose once you access these other sites is not subject to this privacy policy.  Pharmavite® LLC. is not responsible for the privacy policies of these third parties.  We recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on the third party's site to understand what that third party collects and how it uses your personal information.
<br><br>
<b>YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES</b>
<br><br>
You can always choose not to give us any of your personally identifiable information by not registering with us, by not completing any of the forms found on this site or our other web sites, by not ordering our products on line and by not communicating with us by e-mail.  <b>If you provide us with your personally identifiable information you are consenting to our use and disclosure of such information consistent with this policy and the <a href="/useraccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp" class="afont10" target="_self">Terms and Conditions.</a> </b>

<br><br>
When you give us personally identifiable information, you will have the ability -- at the time we collect your information -- to "opt out" of  receiving e-mail communications from Pharmavite® LLC. and from our third-party advertisers, business partners, sponsors and others by unchecking the opt-in box. If you do not uncheck the "opt-in" box, you are specifically consenting to receive such e-mail communications. 
<br><br>
In addition, if you decide that you would prefer not to receive such communications, you can at any time request that Pharmavite® LLC. and its advertisers, third party business partners or sponsors or other third parties not send future e-mail to you either by unsubscribing from the communication (all e-mail mailings will have an opt-out option) or by <a href="javascript:Popup('/ContactUs/cu_mail_lst.asp','700','550')" class="afont10">Clicking here.</a>  When your write, it is imperative that you provide the following information so that we can be sure to honor your request:
<ul>
<li>Your full name;
</li><li>Your e-mail address (if you use more than one e-mail address, send a message to us from each of your e-mail accounts).
</li><li>A sentence asking that your e-mail address be removed from all future e-mail communications.
</li></ul>
Please note that it may take up to seven days for your request to be processed.
<br><br>
<b>SECURITY</b>
<br><br>
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission via the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Pharmavite® LLC. can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. When credit card information is transmitted via the Internet we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption; otherwise your transmissions are not encrypted.  
<br><br>
Our current security practices to protect your personal information once it is in our possession include: (1) using passwords to authenticate users before granting access to personal information (we encourage you change your password regularly and not to share it with anyone) in our possession; (ii) using firewalls to protect information held in our server; (iii) protecting the physical security of our servers; and (iv) limiting employee and consultant access to your personal information.  
<br><br>
However, please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online- for example, via message boards or chat areas - that information can be collected and used by people you don't know.  We cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk. 
<br><br>
<b>UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION; CONTACTING US </b>
