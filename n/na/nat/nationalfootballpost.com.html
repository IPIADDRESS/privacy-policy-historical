I’M BUYING A ROUND FOR THE HEAD COACH OF THE WEEK…
Mike Holmgren                                  Seattle Seahawks
I admit to having a soft spot for Mike.  He’s one of the good people in the league and I root for him to win.   I was hopeful the Seahawks would send Mike out the same way Marquette did former basketball coach Al McGuire, winning the national title in the last game he coached.  This season has been a disaster, and Holmgren has endured more injuries to one team than anyone can imagine.  But yesterday, in the Battle-of-the-Bad Bowl, with the only implication being who will save money by drafting lower in the first round, Holmgren had his team ready to play.  He has gotten Seneca Wallace to play better, and his team keeps fighting each week to find ways to win for their coach.  He might not be coaching in Seattle next season, but he is not quitting coaching.  
I’M BUYING A ROUND FOR AN ASSISTANT COACH OF THE WEEK…
Mike Zimmer                Cincinnati Bengals                   Defensive Coordinator
Zimmer has been the best part of the Bengals this season.  He has given stability to a unit that, in the past, has never had any -- and has always been the Bengals’ Achilles Heel.  In addition, this season he has been able to help the Bengals win games in the NFC East, a division he knows well from his time with the Cowboys.  The Bengals played the Cowboys well before losing late in October and played the Giants well, taking them to overtime before losing. Then they tied the Eagles and finally found a way to win against the Skins.  Zimmer’s ability to know NFC East teams has proven invaluable to the Bengals, and now, once they fix their offense and get Carson Palmer back, they at least have a defense to build on.

YOU HAVE TO WONDER…HOW ABOUT THESE STATS…


	Panthers: 8-0 at home this season (second time in team history they've won all 8 home games in a season; also 8-0 at home in 1996). Panthers have won 3 in a row and 7 of last 8 games. Panthers: third straight game with 30+ points; 6th game with 30+ points this season. Panthers: 11-1 this season when rushing for 100+ yards.
	In their past two games, Steelers have scored 27 of their 33 points in the fourth quarter. Steelers have won 4 games this season in which they trailed in the fourth quarter. Steelers have won 5 in a row in the same season for the first time since 2004. Steelers: allowed 13 points or fewer in 5 consecutive games and 8 games overall this season.
	Bernard Berrian: first career punt return TD; first punt return TD for Vikings since Mewelde Moore on Oct. 30, 2006. Berrian: 15 of 21 career receiving TDs, including playoffs, have been for 30+ yards. 
	Patriots: 22-2 in December since 2003. Patriots: have won last 40 games when leading at the half and won last 39 games when leading entering the fourth quarter (both NFL records since 1970).
	Andre Johnson: 207 receiving yards (franchise record); 24th career 100-yard game (seventh this season); 10th career game with 10+ receptions.  Steve Slaton: fifth 100-yard game this season; third straight 100-yard game. Johnson and Slaton become the first teammates to have 200+ receiving yards and 100+ rush yards in a game since Eagles teammates Brian Westbrook (110 rush yards) and Kevin Curtis (221 receiving yards) vs. Detroit on Sept. 23, 2007.
	Dolphins are 9-0 this season when allowing fewer than 20 points. Dolphins did not have a turnover for the second straight game and fourth time this season (10 turnovers in 14 games this season; 29 turnovers last season). Joey Porter: 1 sack gives him 17.5 this season (1 shy of Jason Taylor's franchise record, set in 2002).
	Chargers scored final 19 points of the game after trailing 21-3 in the third quarter. The 18-point comeback win is tied for the Chargers' third biggest comeback in franchise history. Chargers sweep Chiefs for first time since 2004.Both of SD's 2 wins vs. KC this season were by 1 point.
	Michael Turner: 10th career 100-yard game (seventh this season); 15th rushing TD this season breaks Jamal Anderson's franchise single-season record of 14 set in 1998. John Abraham: 3 sacks for third time this season (sixth career game with 3+ sacks); 15.5 sacks are a new career high.
	Cowboys: fifth straight home win (6-1 at home this season). Cowboys defense had 8 sacks (most by Dallas since 9 vs. Cardinals in 1997); Cowboys lead NFL with 53 sacks this season. Cowboys have won 4 of last 5 regular-season games vs. the Giants.
	Justin Miller: fifth career kick-return TD (second straight game with a kick-return TD).

SO FAR OUT OF THE RACE, THEY ACTUALLY THINK THEY ARE WINNING...
The Skins made it official yesterday losing to the Bengals.  However, their bigger issue is being honest in their own evaluations and understanding they do not have a very talented team in terms of the offensive line.  Once the season got longer and injuries took their toll, the Skins were cooked.  Remember, I’m the one who said on the day of the Jason Taylor trade that the Fins would have more wins at the end of the season than the Skins.  Right now, I have a two-game lead on that prediction.   
RAMBLING THOUGHTS


	Based on the way Marion Barber tried to run the ball last night, thinking he should have played last week was really a pipe dream. I know after watching him that Jerry Jones, the owner of the Boys, felt even worse about his comments.   
	The Steelers play so tough and so hard that they always affect the team they have just played in its next game. So I was a little worried about how the Cowboys would react. Yet they played hard, they played physical and they played with no lingering effects from the Steelers game.  
	Gregg Williams, the defensive coordinator of the Jags, appears unlikely to return there next season.  He had one year left on his contract with the Skins and was coaching in part off that deal.  One thing that’s clear when you watch the Jags’ defense is that it’s not a Gregg Williams-style of defense.  If Gregg Williams cannot run his own stuff, it makes no sense to stay.  
	Justin Miller of the Raiders is a very good kickoff-return man.  He struggles to play corner, but he can make an impact on a team as a returner.  
	Ed Reed’s sack of Big Ben Roethlisberger yesterday might have been one of the best tackles of the season.  It’s hard to tackle Big Ben, and Reed did it all by himself.  
	When Kareem McKenzie, the starting right tackle of the Giants, got injured, it hurt the Giants badly. But when the 49ers lost Adam Snyder at right tackle and had to play Barry Sims, it really affected the team in pass protection.  
	<a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/peter_king/12/14/Week15/4.html">FROM MIKE WISE OF THE WASHINGTON POST...</a> “Whether Cerrato was worried about a loss before the game is unclear. But he informed employees of Red Zebra radio he wasn't doing his Monday radio show, meaning he would not have to be eviscerated by angry callers. It's tough, no, hosting a show called ‘Inside the Red Zone’ when your football team can score only one out of four times from inside the 20-yard-line against the god-awful <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Cincinnati+Bengals?tid=informline">Bengals</a>?”  Why does Vinny do this show?  
	It is my understanding that the Titans will rest some of their players in the next two games and make sure they are healthy and ready for the playoffs.  I would expect the next time you see Albert Haynesworth playing for the Titans is in their home playoff game.  
	The Houston Texans are the kings of finishing strong, but they cannot let these last few weeks of wins affect the tough decisions they will face this off-season.  (They will get another one against the Hotel this week.) They must remain open-minded and realize they have some severe problems on defense.  
	Speaking of off-season decisions, Saints Coach Sean Payton has to sit down and ask himself some tough questions.  He needs to spend time away from the building and get an unbridled and balanced opinion of his team and how to fix the problems.  He now knows that no matter how much Bush lifts in the off-season, he is not his running back. He needs to feature this explosive offense around someone else.  

LET’S HAVE A TOAST TODAY
For Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, who is on the donor list awaiting a heart transplant.  Richardson is the only owner who has played the pro game, and he has run a model franchise since its inception in 1995.  We wish him well.  
HEY, BARTENDER, WHAT’S ON TAP TONIGHT?  
Cleveland 4-9 vs. Philadelphia 7-5-1 
With the Cowboys and Falcons winning yesterday, this becomes a playoff game for the Eagles.  In addition, the Browns are the perfect team to host.  They will struggle to match up on defense, and with Ken Dorsey at quarterback, it will be very hard for the Browns to generate much offense.  
The Browns are 2-0 on Monday Night Football this season. On Oct. 13, they rolled up 454 yards of net offense in a 35-14 victory over the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants. WR Braylon Edwards set a career high with 154 yards on five receptions. DB Eric Wright returned an interception 94 yards in the fourth quarter to seal the Browns’ victory.
In their second appearance, QB Brady Quinn picked up his first career win as a starting quarterback in a 29-27 victory over Buffalo on Nov. 17. Quinn led the Browns on a seven-play 28-yard drive that resulted in K Phil Dawson’s 56-yard game-winning field goal with 1:39 remaining. 
The Browns are 18-25 overall in prime-time games, with a 2-2 mark this season. The Browns are 15-12 on Monday Night Football and hold a 4-4 record on the road. They are 6-1 all-time vs. NFC teams on MNF; Cleveland was the home team in all seven contests.</p>-->

Despite going on a 1-7 slide that left the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=buf">Buffalo Bills</a> out of the playoffs, coach Dick Jauron signed an extension, sources told ESPN.
The deal runs through the 2011 season. ESPN and the NFL Network reported on Oct. 26 that the coach had agreed to the deal. The Bills were 5-2 at that point and in contention in the AFC East.
 
Jauron, 56-74 in nine seasons with the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=chi">Chicago Bears</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=det">Detroit Lions</a> and Bills, entered this season in the final year of his initial three-year contract with Buffalo.</p>-->

            <!--<p>Cleveland Browns (4-9) at Philadelphia Eagles (7-5-1)
Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia
8:30 (EST) ESPN  Weather 56 Degrees, Rain Showers
LINE: Eagles -15.5        OVER: 39.5
Rankings:
Eagles: Offense 354.8 (7th)/ Defense 280.5 (3rd)
Browns: Offense 267.8 (29th)/ Defense 359.3 (26th)
 
What’s at Stake: 
This is a game Philly has to win if it wants to stay in the hunt for the NFC wild card. After two impressive victories over the Cardinals and Giants in respective weeks, the Eagles need to continue winning as the clock ticks towards January. In Cleveland, coaches and front office personnel can improve their standing with a strong finish — if those decisions haven’t already been made. 
Match-Ups to Watch: 
1. Brian Westbrook vs. Cleveland Defense: EDGE Westbrook
I would probably take Westbrook against the Steelers the way he’s playing right now. Don’t be surprised to see the Eagles feature him early in the first quarter, leading to plenty of touches throughout the night. The Browns can’t stop anybody, and don’t believe for one second that they can contain Westbrook.
2. Donovan McNabb vs. Cleveland Secondary: EDGE McNabb
Just as Westbrook has been hot, so has the Eagles’ quarterback.  Since his dramatic benching in Baltimore, McNabb has thrown five touchdowns and zero interceptions in two wins. Cleveland has intercepted 19 passes as a team, but as long as McNabb takes care of the football, I expect him to have big numbers. 
3. Ken Dorsey vs. Philly Pressure: EDGE Philly
Quietly, the Eagles’ defense has risen up the boards in total numbers, finding themselves ranked third overall behind Pittsburgh and Baltimore. They live and die with pressure, which is not good when you are starting a third-string quarterback who was 22-43 for 150 yards and a pick in his first start of the season. Could be a long night for Dorsey. 
4. Andy Reid vs. Romeo Crenel: EDGE Reid
Last month, no one would take Andy Reid as their head coach, but the way the Eagles have responded since he embarrassed his franchise quarterback is called coaching. With Romeo Crennel thinking about putting his house up for sale (along with Phil Savage across the street), I don’t think his team has enough to play for on the road. Reid makes the right calls to help Philly pull away. 
5. Philly Fans vs. Browns Fans: EDGE Philly Fans
A tough call. The “Dawg Pound” vs. “Bird Man” and a bunch of people who have been tailgating since this afternoon. I’ve played in both stadiums, and I have to give the edge to the fans in Philly and their expletive-laced vocabulary. They will be behind their team — if the Eagles start out fast. Add in the fact that NFP Fantasy expert Joe Fortenbaugh will be there in his 2004 T.O. jersey, it’s his birthday, and he decided to take the Cardinals over the Vikings yesterday, and we have a recipe for a tough crowd.
Overview:
The Browns have fallen a long way since their Monday night win over the Giants months ago. Two quarterbacks — Brady Quinn and Derek Anderson — are making plane reservations for the Bahamas. The coach is going to get fired, the GM is probably gone too, and now they have to travel to Philly to play a team in a playoff push. They don’t stand a chance. Westbrook, McNabb and the blitz happy defense it too much. 
Prediction:
It shouldn’t be a fun night for the Browns. The Eagles are giving a ton of points for an NFL game, but it might be well-deserved.

            <!--<p>By JUSTIN EINHORN, STATS Senior Editor
(AP) -- Andy Reid might be saving his job and Romeo Crennel may be about to lose his. 
As bad as Reid's team was the last time it faced a woeful opponent from Ohio, Crennel's crumbling Cleveland Browns are not expected to get in the way of the Philadelphia Eagles' sudden playoff push Monday night. 
This game matches two of the three teams to beat the defending Super Bowl champions this year, but while it appears that was just an aberration for the Browns (4-9), the Eagles (7-5-1) gave notice they're still contenders in the NFC with a 20-14 road win over the New York Giants last Sunday. 
Many fans had written off Philadelphia's postseason hopes in mid-November after a 13-all tie at Cincinnati - the Bengals have won one game this season - and the following week's 36-7 loss to Baltimore. 
Much of the scrutiny fell on Donovan McNabb, criticized for admitting he didn't know games could end in ties and benched for the second half of the Ravens loss, but Reid also deserved plenty of blame and it appeared his job was in jeopardy. However, the Eagles have bounced back to the last two weeks to beat the only NFC teams that have clinched playoff spots. 
"Anything can happen in the NFL, so you just have to make sure that you take care of your business and you can't worry about really anything else," Reid said. 
The Eagles trail Atlanta, Tampa Bay and Dallas - all currently 9-5 - for the NFC's two wild-card spots, and can move within one-half game of them with a victory. 
Cleveland is already out of the playoff picture and it appears Crennel might be out of the Browns' future plans. Rumors have run rampant that the team will not bring him back next year, with Cleveland already having clinched its third losing record in Crennel's four seasons. 
"I can't be worried about that," he said. "Rumors and stories, they're going to be out there. When you lose, that's what happens. Not only for me but for other people in the league." 
The Browns offense has averaged 7.0 points and 203.7 yards during its current three-game losing streak, failing to score a touchdown in those games. The Browns have never gone four consecutive games without getting into the end zone and no team has done it since 2000, when Baltimore went five straight without a TD but won the Super Bowl. 
It might be hard to blame Crennel for the passing game accounting for just 380 yards during that span because he's had to start a different quarterback each week. 
After losing Brady Quinn and Derek Anderson to season-ending injuries, Cleveland will give Ken Dorsey his second straight start Monday after he posted a dismal 49.6 quarterback rating last Sunday in a 28-9 loss at Tennessee. Dorsey was 22-of-43 for 150 yards with an interception, and the ground game provided no help with a season-low 35 yards on 19 carries. 
The Eagles running game is in much better shape behind Brian Westbrook, and Reid might continue relying on it more despite usually employing a pass-heavy approach. Apparently back at full strength after missing time with ankle and rib injuries, Westbrook tied a season high with 22 carries for 110 yards in a 48-20 Thanksgiving win over Arizona before rushing a career-high 33 times for 131 yards against the Giants. 
Westbrook has totaled six touchdowns over the past two weeks while Philadelphia has run for 329 yards on 81 attempts - two fewer passes than McNabb has in the same span. 
"We're in a position now where we have to win them all," Westbrook said. "We're going to take them one week at a time but we have to win them all to get into the playoffs." 
Westbrook will face a Cleveland run defense which ranks 28th in the NFL, allowing 148.5 yards per game. The Browns gave up a season-worst 235 rushing yards last week versus Tennessee. 
Half of Cleveland's wins this season have been on Monday night - 29-27 at Buffalo on Nov. 17 in its most recent victory and 35-14 over the Giants in Week 6. 
However, the Browns have lost five of six. 
"What we're doing is not enough," Cleveland linebacker D'Qwell Jackson said. "Guys have to do a little extra. I wish I had a magic wand to wave and fix all of the problems, but I don't. That's the life for us this year." 
McNabb has thrown for at least 375 yards and four touchdowns in each of the Eagles' two wins over Cleveland this decade. The Browns have not visited Philadelphia since a 26-7 win in 1994, and haven't lost in four games there since 1967. 
Safety Brian Dawkins will play in his 181st game with the Eagles, breaking a tie with Harold Carmichael for the franchise record. 
Dawkins goes further back with Philadelphia than even Reid, who has one of the NFL's best December records of the past 10 years at 29-17 - 9-2 the past three seasons. 
"Anything can happen. We've got three more games that we have to take care of business with," Reid said. "It's not a time to sit back and relax." </p>-->

Dungy said Sanders and running back Joseph Addai have a good chance to play. Addai didn't practice last week after injuring his right shoulder in the win over Cincinnati.
"Probably both of those guys would have been doubtful to play two games in five days,'' Dungy said. "We thought the prudent thing was to rest them up. I think they should be ready to go.''</p>-->

From <a title="Tampa Bay" href="http://www.pewterreport.com/forum/index.php?topic=32838.0" target="_blank">The Pewter Report.com</a>:
Tampa Bay head coach Jon Gruden held a press conference at One Buc Place on Monday morning to discuss the team's 13-10 overtime loss to the Atlanta Falcons. Gruden disclosed that Bucs strong safety Jermaine Phillips sustained a fractured forearm (different than the forearm injury he sustained earlier in the year) and is out for the season. Bucs weakside linebacker Derrick Brooks also suffered a rib injury on Sunday is is "very questionable" for the upcoming game vs. the San Diego Chargers. Gruden said Brooks' injury is "very concerning." 
Gruden said he would wait until Wednesday before determining which quarterback would start for the Bucs vs. the Chargers.
