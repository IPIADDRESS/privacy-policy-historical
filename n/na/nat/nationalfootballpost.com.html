Cleveland - Sources have told 19 Action News the Browns will either take USC quarterback Mark Sanchez or Texas Tech wide receiver Michael Crabtree.  The Browns have the fifth pick in next week's NFL Draft.
Rumors have swirled around the team concerning a trade with Braylon Edwards and Brady Quinn.  One report said the team will trade Edwards to the Giants before the draft.

            <!--<p>From Mike Reiss of The Boston Globe:
Patriots coach Bill Belichick is scheduled to be one of the featured speakers at the <a href="http://www.gatorzone.com/story.php?id=15611" target="new">University of Florida coaches clinic</a> this weekend, and he's utilized the trip to also take care of some draft business.
Belichick and Director of Player Personnel Nick Caserio put tight end <a href="http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/cornelius-ingram?id=71337" target="new">Cornelius Ingram</a> through a private workout on campus today, according to a source.
Ingram (6-4, 245) is projected as a second- or third-round draft choice, according to the Pro Football Weekly Draft Guide, which notes that "he has the potential to emerge as the best pass-catching TE prospect in the draft class with natural athletic ability and ball skills that cannot be taught."
Private workouts are a small part of the overall scouting process, although when Belichick devotes his valuable time to put a prospect through a workout, it is especially notable.

New retiree John Madden plans on staying retired, the former Raiders coach said when asked if he would rejoin Raiders owner Al Davis's payroll as a consultant.
<a href="http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/jm122.jpg"></a>
"No," Madden said on his daily appearance on KCBS radio Friday. "I have too much respect for the game and for Al to think that I can do anything. The way the game is today, that's a 20-hour a day job. You can't go in part-time or just stick your toe in the water to be a part of a pro football team. You either do it or you don't."
The speculation began shortly after Madden announced his retirement from television broadcasting, where he became a national icon who yelled "Boom!" and scribbled his analysis on the screen.

Despite reports this week to the contrary, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=cle">Cleveland Browns</a> quarterback <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=8627">Derek Anderson</a> did not have offseason knee surgery following a left MCL injury that ended his 2008 season, multiple sources told ESPN.com.
The Browns have avoided this question for months now, which led some to think surgery was needed. But sources said surgery wasn't necessary for Anderson, and that Cleveland's decision to be secretive and evasive about injuries is simply a way of life under new head coach Eric Mangini.
"Derek's 100 percent," Browns general manager George Kokinis said bluntly Thursday when asked about the quarterback and surgery.

Two independent sources with knowledge of the situation have confirmed to NFLDraftScout.com that the <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/page/DET">Detroit Lions</a> have entered into preliminary negotiations with the representatives for Georgia quarterback <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/1114942">Matthew Stafford</a>, Baylor offensive tackle <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/516673">Jason Smith</a> and Wake Forest linebacker <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/516519">Aaron Curry</a> for the right to be the first player selected in the 2009 NFL Draft on April 25. 
<a href="http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/stafford52.jpg"></a>
The sources declined to go on the record discussing conversations related to Detroit's intentions with the selection. 
While general manager Martin Mayhew has said it is "critical" for the team to have a deal in place with the No. 1 overall pick before the draft, team president Tim Lewand softened that stance a bit this week. 
"It is certainly a goal of ours," Lewand told the Detroit Free Press, "and I think the teams that have been able to sign their player prior to the draft have seen a better measure of success by and large. Now is that because there's a contract in place? I don't know if there's a causal effect or not."

<a href="http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/sanchez3.jpg"></a>
Seattle Seahawks general manager Tim Ruskell talked with local reporters for about 45 minutes this afternoon about the upcoming draft.
Even with the latest speculation of teams reportedly interested in moving up to select USC quarterback Mark Sanchez, Ruskell said he did not like his team’s chances of trading down, in part because he believes there are really no franchise-changing players at the top of the draft.
Ruskell also says the team has its top four players pegged – although the organization is still debating the order – and that the Seattle has not cemented who they want to pick at four.

<li>We       respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or       exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</li>
<li>We       believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate,       prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,       situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any       person, violations of NFP’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by       law.</li>
<li>We       transfer information about you if NFP is acquired by or merged with       another company. In this event, NFP will notify you before information       about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy       policy.</li>
</ul>

<li>NFP      displays targeted advertisements based on personal information.      Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who      interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria-for      example, men ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
<ul type="circle">
<li>NFP       does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you       interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or       viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser       will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to       display the ad.</li>
<li>NFP       advertisers may include financial service providers (such as banks,       insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial       companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NFP      works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in      different industries and categories of business.</li>

Other companies’ use of their      cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.      Advertisers or other companies do not have access to NFP’s cookies.</li>
<li>NFP may      use web beacons to access NFP cookies inside and outside our network of      web sites and in connection with NFP products and services.</li>
