</p><h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>We employ cookie technology to help visitors and Users move faster through the website portion of the Service. When a visitor or User accesses a South49 Solutions website and takes advantage of certain features, we place several cookies on that User's computer.

We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such resource to determine how it protects your privacy. 

</p><h2>Policy Modifications</h2>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically.
