<p>A cookie is a small piece of data sent by our computer to yours so that information can be recalled.</p>

<p>A cookie is stored by your web browser in a text file on your computer with the word 'cookie' in its name. Each time your web browser requests a page from our web server, the cookie's message is sent back. Only Nationwide's web server may read the contents of a cookie you accept from us.</p>

<p>Nationwide uses cookies in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>to store your Customer Number so that you don't have to type it in each time you sign on to the Internet Bank</li>

<ul>
<li>to track how users reach our site and the path they take through it to help us to improve our service to you</li>

<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Browser or Web Browser</strong></p>

<p>There are many web browsers but the most common ones are Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Web browsers are used to locate and display web pages.</p>

<p><strong>IP (Internet Protocol)</strong></p>

<p>All networks connected to the internet speak IP, the technical standard which allows data to be transmitted between two devices. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is responsible for making sure messages get from one computer to another and that the messages are understood.</p>

<p><strong>IP Address</strong></p>

<p>When you are connected to the Internet you have an IP address. It may look something like this - 198.184.98.9</p>

<p>If you are a dial-up customer using an analogue modem or ISDN, your IP address will usually change each time you connect to the Internet. This means that you cannot be uniquely identified by your IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Web Server</strong></p>

<p>The computer which sends web pages to your computer.</p>
