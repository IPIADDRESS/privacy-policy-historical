<h1>Privacy Policies</h1>

<p>The information on these pages is provided to assist you in finding information that will help you understand the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/privstat.htm" title="Privacy Act" target="_blank">Privacy Act</a> (Public Law 5 U.S.C. § 552a, as amended), as it relates to privacy policies of the U.S. Geological Survey, a bureau of the Department of the Interior. See <a href="http://www.doi.gov/privacy.cfm" title="DOI Privacy Policy" target="_blank">DOI Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>How We Handle the Information We Gather When You Visit Our Web Site</h3>

<p>The type of information that we receive from your visit to our Web sites depends upon what you do when visiting our sites.  We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our sites and to help us make our sites more useful to visitors.</p> 

<p id="children"><span class="bold">Child Privacy</span> - The USGS values the privacy and protection of children in the use of its Web sites. We adhere to the privacy policies stated below in dealing with children 13 years and younger and for all visitors to USGS Web sites. (for more information see "<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm" title="Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998" target="_blank">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998</a>."</p>

<p>It is the policy of the USGS that we will not obtain personal identifying information about you when you visit our Web sites, unless you choose to provide the information to us (for example, through a questionnaire in which you willingly provide such information, or in which you are requesting a publication or other information to be transmitted to you by the USGS).</p>

<p id="enforcement"><span class="bold">Identification for Law Enforcement or Unauthorized Use</span> - The only time that we will attempt to identify individual users or to share any information we receive with any parties outside of the USGS is (1)&nbsp;in the course of officially authorized law enforcement investigations or (2)&nbsp;in the event of a suspected attempt to deliberately circumvent our system's security with the intent to gain <a href="http://www.doi.gov/disclaimer.cfm" title="DOI Disclaimer Policy" target="_blank">unauthorized access</a> or to do physical damage (for example, an attack by hackers).  In the latter case, information collected about a suspected intruder may be shared with the USGS Information Technology Security Manager (see Contact information below).</p>

<p><span class="bold">Web Server Activity</span> - Like most Web servers on the Internet, USGS servers collect and store within Web access logs all of the information that your Web browser sends when it requests a Web page, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the name, domain, and numerical internet address of the host computer (typically a computer belonging to your Internet Service Provider and not your personal computer) from which you access the Internet; </li>
	<li>the date and time you accessed our site; </li>
	<li>the Internet address of the Web page that you came from; </li>
	<li>the page you requested from our site and the number of characters sent to your computer; and </li>
	<li>the information your Web browser software sends as its so-called “User Agent,” which typically identifies the browser software and may also indicate the operating system used in your personal computer and the type of computer. </li>
</ul>

<p>It is impossible to determine the actual identity of an individual user from this information.
The logs are periodically summarized and analyzed to study site usage over time and to perform other studies to help us improve the site's organization, performance, and usefulness. Monthly extracts of the log files are archived and stored offline at our discretion for an indefinite period of time. Some statistical summaries derived from these data may be retained online or offline at our discretion for an indefinite period of time.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Cookies</span> - Some applications may save a “cookie” on your computer's hard disk to provide a temporary history of actions taken. Cookies are small text files that a web site transfers to your computer to allow the site to remember specific information. If you do not want cookies to be transferred to your computer, you may choose to opt out by <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml" title="Modifying your browser options" target="_blank">modifying your browser options</a>.  Opting out of cookies in no way diminishes your access to information or services. </p>

<p>Session cookies do not contain Personally Identifiable Information. Once a browser is closed, the cookies disappear. An example of a session cookie used on some USGS Web sites is the ForeSee Results' American Customer Satisfaction Index survey. </p>
<p> 
Persistent cookies store information on your computer for longer periods of time. USGS may use persistent cookies on some web sites to improve online services. These persistent cookies do not contain personally identifiable information. USGS does not use persistent cookies that contain Personally Identifiable Information unless specifically stated on the Web page and the visitor has provided explicit consent.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Third Party Websites and Applications</span> - The USGS utilizes some third-party websites and applications that are not exclusively operated or controlled by a government entity and are not subject to the USGS Privacy Policy.  Often these technologies are located on a “.com” website or other location that is not part of an official government domain.  All users are encouraged to review the applicable third-party privacy policy, evaluate any potential risks and assess periodically thereafter.  Personal Identifiable Information (PII) as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may be minimally collected by USGS to accomplish a purpose required by statute, regulation or executive order.  In the event that USGS collects PII from a third-party website or application, the USGS Privacy  Officer must approve, the public will be notified via a Federal Register comment period which will contain the type of information being collected, for intended purpose of the collection, the retention period, as well as other specifics. </p>

<p><span class="bold">E-Mail or Web Forms</span> - When you send us personal identifying information by contacting us via e-mail (that is, in a message containing a question or comment) or by filling out a form that e-mails us this information, we use it to respond to your requests. We may forward your e-mail or information to other Government employees or contract personnel who are better able to answer your questions.</p>

<p>We do not retain or distribute lists of e-mail addresses to any parties outside the USGS, except as necessary to conduct official U.S. Government business, and we do not distribute lists of e-mail addresses to non-Government entities.  Information collected via e-mail or Web form will be retained at our discretion in a readable form for as long as necessary to complete our response. The e-mail or information may be retained in an archival form as required by Federal laws and regulations governing the retention of historical records of Government agencies. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/" title="National Archives and Records Administration's Records Management Program" target="_blank">National Archives and Records Administration's Records Management Program</a>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</span> - Many USGS sites using the file transfer protocol may also store your e-mail address if your Web browser is configured to provide it. By default, most Web browser software does not send your e-mail address; this option is configured through your browser preferences. </p>

<p><span class="bold">Online Surveys</span> - When you voluntarily provide us with personal information as part of an online survey, we use it to perform various quantitative and qualitative analyses to improve customer service and satisfaction. We may forward the information collected to other Government employees or contract personnel to perform the actual analysis. You are under no obligation to participate in such surveys. Non-participation will not inhibit your use of our Web site in any way. If you provided the information to us in error, you may request its removal at any time. Information collected via online surveys may be retained at our discretion for an indefinite period of time.  </p>

<p><span class="bold">Ordering Products Online</span> - When you voluntarily provide us with personal information such as name, shipping and billing address, and credit card number when ordering products online, we use the information to fulfill your order. We may forward the information collected to other Government employees or contract personnel or to other computer systems (such as secure electronic commerce servers) to complete the requested transaction.</p>

<h3>Site Security</h3> 

<p>To provide site security and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, our Government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this Web site are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. Information may also be used for authorized law enforcement investigations. For more information, see the section entitled, "<a href="#enforcement">Identification for Law Enforcement or Unauthorized Use</a>."</p>
