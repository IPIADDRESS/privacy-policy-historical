							<h2 data-section-number="4">How do we use your information and what is our legal basis for processing it?</h2>
							<div><p>We will only process your information if we have a legal basis for doing so under current UK data protection legislation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processing your information because it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, for example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To process payments;</li>
<li>To fulfil orders for exhibition tickets or other events or services; or</li>
<li>To provide you with Membership benefits, or patrons' benefits, which you are contractually entitled to receive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where we are required by law to process your information</strong>, for example:
<ul>
<li>To make a Gift Aid claim.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where we have your consent to process your information</strong>, for example:<br>
<ul>
<li>Where you have agreed to receive email updates in relation to the Gallery;</li>
<li>Where you have asked to receive information about our education events for teachers, our research events, or our national programme events; or</li>
<li>Where you have agreed to participate in a Gallery-based research project to improve the information we provide on our paintings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Where you have given consent to the processing of your data you may withdraw it at any time. See below ‘What rights do you have in relation to your personal information?'</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where processing your information is necessary for our legitimate interests</strong>, for example:
<ul>
<li>To process donations;</li>
<li>Where we combine information we hold about you to better understand your interests and preferences so that we can target communications we send to you in line with the information contained in this privacy policy;</li>
<li>Where we conduct analysis and research in relation to our supporters.</li>
<li>Where we collect MAC addresses for the purposes of monitoring and analysing the usage of, and maintaining, our free public Wi-Fi service, and also analysing (in an aggregated and anonymous format) visitor movements around the Gallery to improve our visitor experience;</li>
<li>Where we collect and view images recorded on our CCTV cameras, which we use only for security reasons, to help us keep our visitors, staff, and collection safe; or</li>
<li>Where (from time to time) we (or a third party) carry out any filming, including interviews or filming/photographing of talks or events in the Gallery. Where particular areas of the Gallery are going to be used for filming or photography, we will always flag this in advance with clear signage or otherwise make you aware of the filming in advance, so that you can avoid being filmed or photographed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Where we are relying on this basis of processing you have the right to object to this. See below ‘What rights do you have in relation to your personal information?'</p>
<ul>
<li>As a public authority we may also process your personal data <strong>where it is necessary for performing our <a data-udi="umb://document/15b624b8737e46c79a67f4a37a78ee16" href="/about-us/organisation/policies/statement-of-public-task" title="Statement of Public Task">Public Task</a></strong>.<br><br></li>
<li>We may process <strong>special category data</strong> (for example, health data) on the basis of additional grounds, including where it is necessary to protect an individual's vital interests (for example where you have a life-threatening accident or illness while visiting the Gallery and we have to process your personal data in order to&nbsp;make sure you receive appropriate medical attention).</li>
</ul></div>
							<h2 data-section-number="5">Do we share your information with other organisations?</h2>
							<div><p>We will not sell your personal information to any third parties or external organisations.</p>

<h2>Sharing information of patrons and donors</h2>
<p>If you are a patron or donor we may share information with the National Gallery Trust or the American Friends of the National Gallery, London Inc. if you make your donations through one or other of those supporting charities. See <a data-udi="umb://document/723816eef72e49d9a6e6d53a7454874d" href="/privacy-policy/what-this-means-for-our-donors-patrons-and-potential-supporters" title="What this means for our donors, patrons, and potential supporters">What this means for our donors, patrons, and potential supporters</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>Sharing CCTV footage&nbsp;and Wi-Fi usage data</h2>
<p>CCTV footage and Wi-Fi usage data (including MAC addresses)&nbsp;may, in the event of a security incident, be shared with the police and/or local authorities where it is lawful and appropriate to do so, in accordance with our legitimate interests outlined above.</p></div>
							<h2 data-section-number="6">How long do we keep your information? </h2>
							<div><p>We will keep your information for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, to comply with legal requirements, tax, and accounting rules, or for other reasonable legal purposes.</p>
<p>The retention period will vary according to the nature of the purpose under which the information is held. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We retain Gift Aid declarations in accordance with HMRC guidance, which in the case of a one-off donation is generally six years from the end of the accounting period in which the donation is received; the period is longer in the case of a declaration which applies to a series of donations or if an HMRC query is received during the normal retention period; and</li>
<li>we normally retain CCTV footage for 30 days although in the event of an accident or incident which may give rise to an insurance claim, which is captured on CCTV, it may be retained longer.</li>
</ul></div>
							<h2 data-section-number="7">How do we keep your information secure?</h2>
							<div><p>We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us to try to prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unauthorised access;</li>
<li>improper use or disclosure;</li>
<li>unauthorised modification; and</li>
<li>accidental loss, damage, and destruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are required to&nbsp;make sure any transfers of information will be done securely, in accordance with best practice, and in compliance with Data Protection regulations.</p>
<p>All our staff and data processors who have access to, and are associated with the processing of, personal information are legally obliged to respect the confidentiality of the personal information of our visitors, email subscribers, Members, shoppers, supporters, and all those who engage with us.</p>
<h2>Transfers of data outside the EEA</h2>
<p>In some cases, some of the services we provide or some of the processes we use may involve personal information being transferred outside the European Economic Area, for example where any data processors' servers are located outside the EEA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you access our website or use any of the services we provide while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with those services.</p>
<p>If we do transfer personal data outside the EEA, it will only be done on one of the lawful bases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The transfer is to a recipient in a country or territory approved by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data;</li>
<li>the transfer is to a recipient that has entered into European Commission standard contractual clauses with us;</li>
<li>the transfer is to a recipient in the United States of America who has registered under the EU/US Privacy Shield; or</li>
<li>you have explicitly consented to the transfer.</li>
</ul>
