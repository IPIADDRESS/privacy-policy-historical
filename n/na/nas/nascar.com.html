						<p>
							Thank you for visiting NASCAR.COM. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (including its 
							subsidiaries, collectively, "Turner") operates NASCAR.COM pursuant to agreements 
							with the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc. and NASCAR Media Group, 
							LLC. (collectively, "NASCAR").  NASCAR.COM is a general audience site and part of 
							Turner's network of affiliated websites (such sites, collectively, the "Turner 
							Network"), which includes any sites or services owned, operated or offered by or on 
							behalf of Turner or its affiliates. Your privacy is important to Turner and NASCAR 
							("we", "us" or "our"). To better protect your privacy, we provide this statement 
							explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the 
							way your information is collected and used at NASCAR.COM and on the Turner Network. 
							Please be advised that the practices described in this privacy policy apply only to 
							information gathered through and in connection with this web site (including 
							NASCAR.COM and those other NASCAR-branded platforms operated by Turner which post a 
							link to this policy) and the Turner Network and do not necessarily reflect our 
							practices for other NASCAR-branded sites, including the NASCAR.COM Superstore. Please 
							see the NASCAR.COM Superstore's Privacy Notice for information about its privacy policies.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>The Information We Collect</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							At some Turner Network sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or 
							otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online 
							newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. In the course 
							of these various offerings, we often seek to collect from you various forms of personal 
							information. Examples of the types of personally identifiable information that may be 
							collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax 
							number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of 
							various products, programs, and services.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							At some Turner Network sites, you may also be able to submit information about other people. 
							For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic 
							greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, 
							you might submit the recipient's name and address. Examples of the types of personally 
							identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: 
							recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.	
						</p>
						
						<p>
							At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested 
							personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services 
							or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We, our service providers, advertisers and partners may collect various types of 
							non-personally identifiable information when you visit any of our sites. A representative list 
							of the types of non-personally identifiable information we may collect include: current Internet 
							protocol address and type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type 
							of operating system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the domain name of your 
							Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast, Verizon or AT&amp;T), the web pages you have visited, sites 
							visited before and after you visit a site on the Turner Network, the type of handheld or mobile 
							device used to view the site (e.g., iPhone, Blackberry), location information, the content you 
							have accessed and the advertisements you have been shown and/or clicked on.							
						</p>		
						
						<p>
							You also can engage with our content, such as video, games, applications, and other offerings, on 
							or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook, and Turner Network or third-party 
							social media plug-ins and applications.   When you engage with our content on or through third party 
							social networking sites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain 
							information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, 
							location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the 'likes' 
							you make) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application.  We may also obtain 
							non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and 
							information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on,) from 
							your interaction with our content.
						</p>
						 
						<p>
							When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) 
							give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our 
							applications or websites, and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending 
							you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards.  By doing so, you consent to the use of this 
							information in accordance with our privacy policy. When you provide personal information to us through an 
							application, on our sites, or on social networking sites, it may be publicly viewed by other members of 
							these sites and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Through some social networking sites' privacy settings, you can control what data you share. For more 
							information about how social networking sites handle your personal information, please refer to their 
							privacy policies and terms of use.
						</p> 
						
						<p>
							<b>How We Use the Information</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and 
							services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, to offer you other products, programs or services 
							that we believe may be of interest to you, to enforce the legal terms that govern your use of our sites, and/or 
							for the purposes for which you provided the information.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our 
							contests or when we make changes to our terms of use, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to 
							contact you about your account with us.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards or emails you may 
							wish to send them from our sites, and for such other purposes as may be stated at the point where the information is 
							collected.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive 
							experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time 
							to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., questions for an online chat guest, a letter to our editors, 
							comments sent to our television personalities, a posting to a blog or a discussion board, a video), we may publish 
							your screen name and other information you have provided to us (e.g., transcript of the chat, including your question).    
							Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if you register and create a profile with our site, the screen name 
							you select as well as other content you submit to your profile (e.g., photos, comments, video, reviews) will be displayed 
							publicly on the site and may be reused and redistributed by us in our discretion.	
						</p>
						 
						<p>
							We may on occasion combine information we collect through our sites with information that we collect from other sources.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our sites, to 
							deliver more relevant marketing messages and advertisements and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We 
							also may use this information to analyze usage of our sites, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court 
							order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where 
							we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, 
							situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify 
							or enforce compliance with the policies governing our sites and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted 
							by law or consistent with legal requirements.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information about you if we, or one of our business units, are 
							acquired by, sold to, merged with or otherwise transferred to another entity.
						</p>
							
						<p>
							Our agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information 
							in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement and are not authorized to use the information for any purpose 
							other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you 
							that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this 
							privacy statement.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement 
							(e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that want to 
							market products or services to you. If a Turner Network site shares personally identifiable information, it will provide you

							<b>Cookies &amp; Web Beacons</b>	
						</p>
						
						<p>
							To enhance your online experience, we use "cookies" or similar technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your 
							computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once 
							you choose to furnish a site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored 
							in the cookie.	
						</p>				
						
						<p>
							We use cookies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements 
							on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our sites (e.g., to recognize you by name 
							when you return to a site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our 
							sites. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to 
							deliver relevant advertising.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We, our third party service providers, advertisers or our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the performance 
							of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or sites. This also helps 
							us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising. For more information regarding third-party ad 
							servers, see "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors" below.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The Adobe Flash Player is a powerful application and web tool that allows rapid development of highly dynamic content. Sites 
							on the Turner Network employ locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies") in certain situations where 
							we use Flash to provide special content such as video on demand, video clips or animation. Flash (and similar applications) 
							use this technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but Flash cookies are not managed 
							through your web browser. You can access your Flash management tools from 
							<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">
							Adobe's website</a> directly.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We, our third party service providers, advertiser or our partners may also use "web beacons" or clear .gifs, or similar 
							technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors 
							viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the 
							browser of a visitor viewing that page.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set 
							your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or 
							block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features 
							offered at Turner Network sites. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Some of our sites contain links to or integrations with other sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., whose 
							information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no 
							control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Turner Network sites covered by this privacy statement may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, 
							applications, or social network integrations) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue 
							of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit 
							to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The site will 
							notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, 
							and site analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties 
							may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may also place web 
							beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies 
							and is not covered by this privacy statement.
						</p> 
						
						<p>
							<b>Ad Choices</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Our goal at the Turner Network is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. Advertising enables us to provide the rich 
							content for which sites on the Turner Network are known. Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but 
							we also provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance 
							your experience across the Turner Network's diverse websites.
						</p> 
						
						<p>
							For example, if you often visit content on the Turner Network about travel, we may use "web beacons" to infer your possible 
							interest in travel and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest. It's important to understand that these technologies 
							do not use personally identifiable information to make this happen but instead use anonymous identifiers within the "cookies" 
							stored in your browser. We offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based ads and the 
							choices available to you, please visit our 
							<a href="/services/ad.choices/" target="_blank">Ad Choices</a> page. 
						</p> 
						
						<p>
							<b>Turner's Participation in the Industry Self Regulatory Program for Interest Based Ads; Additional Choice Options</b>
						</p>	
						
						<p>
							Turner is a participant in the online industry's self regulatory program administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance 
							(the "DAA") and has agreed to adhere to the DAA's principles applicable to interest-based ads.  Please visit the 
							<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">Self Regulatory Program</a> site for more information about the DAA, the 
							self regulatory principles and choices you can make regarding interest-based ads.

						<p>
							<b>International Transfer</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Turner operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. In particular, your information will 
							likely be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. The data protection 
							and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be 
							assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using this site you consent to your 
							information being collected, used and transferred as set forth in this privacy statement.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Our Commitment to Security</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized 
							access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>How You Can Access or Correct Information</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Access to personally identifiable information that is collected from our sites and that we maintain may be available to you. 
							For example, if you created a password-protected account within our site, you can access that account to review the information 
							you provided.
