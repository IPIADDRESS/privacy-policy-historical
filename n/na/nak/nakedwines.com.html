    <li>By placing an order with Naked Wines you are confirming
        that you are 18 or older. It is illegal for us to sell alcohol
        to anyone under the age of 18.</li>
    <li>When you give Naked Wines your credit or
        debit card details you are confirming that you are either the card holder,
        or that you have permission from the card holder to use the card for the 
        purpose of ordering wine. N.B. If you're claiming a free case of wine, 
        gifted by one of our partners for example, you will still need to provide 
        us with card details - even if we're not charging you anything.</li>

    <li>No payment will be taken from your card until the goods
        you have ordered are dispatched from our warehouse, or your
        monthly Angels payment / MarketPlace payment (if appropriate)
        is due. Please note, when you place an order, we will securely
        store your card details so it's easier for you to place any
        future orders, but we will never take payment from your card
        unless you authorise us to do so.</li>


    <li>We reserve the right to cancel any orders we cannot
        fulfill for any reason. If your order is cancelled we will
        contact you to explain why and refund any money you have paid
        us for that order.</li>

    <li> 
    Our standard delivery service is next day (Monday to Saturday) to most UK addresses, when you order before 5pm. 
    The delivery charge is £4.99 OR it's free if you spend <span>£100</span> or more. 
    We also offer guaranteed delivery before noon on Saturday for £6.99. N.B. 
    Some sale cases may be exempt from free delivery (which we'll make clear on the website) - and if you're using a voucher or a gift 
    card to buy your wine, or claiming a free bottle, you have to spend <span>£100</span> of your own money 
    to qualify for free delivery. If we are swamped with orders, we will bring the 5pm cut-off forward so that we can keep our promise to the 
    customers who have already ordered.
    </li>
    <li>We are unable to guarantee delivery dates to some areas
        of the UK (see the full list of out-of-area postcodes
        listed <a href="/terms#outofarea" data-toggle="tab">here.</a>
    </li>
    <li>If your order goes missing, or is damaged, between
        dispatch and delivery, we will send you a replacement order as
        soon as we can. If we are unable to dispatch replacement goods
        within 7 days we will offer you a full refund. For these
        purposes, delivery takes place when products are left at your
        delivery address or with someone else in accordance with your
        instructions.</li>
    <li>For your own safety we reserve the right to contact
        your card issuer for the purposes of carrying out security
        checks.</li>
    <li>Any promotions, discounts or vouchers are single use
        only and not to be used in conjunction with any other
        promotion, discount or voucher unless otherwise stated.</li>
    <li>There are certain products, such as pre-order deposits and tasting tickets, 
        where you can only use cash to buy them. By cash we mean money you've deposited 
        into your Naked Wines account, Fine Wine Bond interest or payment by credit / debit card. 
        If you have any additional credits in your account, these won't come off the value of your 
        order if ordering these products. 
    </li>
    <li>Products offered by us are displayed on our website(s)
        in 'real time'. This is to say that any product may be
        withdrawn from offer without notice.</li>
    <li>If for some reason we are unable to fulfil your exact
        order, we reserve the right to substitute up to 3 bottles with
        similar wines of at least the same value as the wine you
        ordered. Of course, the 3 substitute bottles are covered by our
        money back guarantee as set out below. If we need to substitute
        more than 3 bottles in any one order we will put your order on
        hold and contact you for further instructions.</li>
    <li>All of our wines are covered by our money-back-guarantee i.e. if you're unhappy with the wines then we'll give you your money back. Please note that if you need to return your wines to us, we'll either arrange collection or we're happy to collect from a local Majestic (just drop us a call first).</li>
    <li>So the recipient knows who the gift is from, you agree to your name and postcode
         being shown under your personal message for gifts you send from Naked Wines. The message
          and your details can't be seen in transit, and are only revealed when the recipient 
          peels back the gift message label to read your personal message underneath.</li>

                                    <section class="mb10 mt10">
                                        <p>If you're lucky enough to receive a voucher or gift card from one of our partners, OR a gift certificate from a friend, here's how they work:</p>
    <h5 class="bold blue pt10">Vouchers</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Our vouchers are for first time customers only (apart
                from a handful of exceptions) and they can be redeemed online
                or over the phone.</li>
            <li>They cannot be combined with any other offer or
                promotion (Angel prices for example) and they're one voucher
                per person (i.e. we can't stack them otherwise we'd be giving
                too much wine away!).</li>
            <li>They're also for one-off purchases only i.e. you're not
                required to join any type of wine club when redeeming your
                voucher (although we will invite you to become an <a href="/angels">Angel!</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Our vouchers typically have a minimum spend associated
                with them, unless otherwise stated. For example:

                <ul>
                    <li>£75 off a case worth £114.99 or more
                        (excl. delivery, £4.99 to most UK addresses)</li>
                    <li>£100 off a case worth £149.99 or more
                        (excl. delivery, £4.99 to most UK addresses)</li>
                </ul>
       
            </li><li>BUT please note, the minimum spend does vary from
                voucher to voucher so please refer to the voucher itself.</li>
            <li>Before you get spending, you'll have to register with
                us first, including email address and credit/debit card details.
                We'll use your card details to verify your age in addition to taking payment.</li>
            <li>Your voucher can be used against the vast majority of
                cases on our site (we will make it clear if you can't) - as
                long as it hits the minimum spend. And please see voucher for
                any expiry date that may apply.</li>
            <li>As with all orders, if you're not happy with any of the
                wines for any reason, we will give you your money back!</li>

        </ol>
        
       <h5 class="bold blue pt10">Gift Vouchers / Gift Cards</h5>
       
       <ol>
            <li>Our gift vouchers / gift cards, can be redeemed online
                or over the phone by new or existing customers (unless
                otherwise stated on your voucher).</li>
            <li>They cannot be combined with any other offer (Angel
                prices for example) and they're one voucher per person (i.e. we
                can't stack them).</li>
            <li>They're also for one-off purchases only i.e. you're not
                required to join any type of wine club when redeeming your
                voucher (although we will invite you to become an <a href="/angels">Angel!</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Before you get spending, you'll have to register with
                us first, including credit / debit card details (even if you're
                not spending any of your own money), so we can verify your age,
                check where to send the wine to - and take any necessary
                payment.</li>
            <li>Your gift voucher can be used against the vast majority
                of cases on our site (we will make it clear if you can't).</li>
            <li>If you want to top-up your spend i.e. your wine and
                delivery comes to more than the value of your voucher, we will
                charge the outstanding balance to your registered credit /
                debit card (OR use up any existing account balance if
                applicable).</li>
            <li>N.B. If you don't use the full balance of your gift
                voucher in the one transaction, you will lose any outstanding
                balance, so it's best to spend it all upfront! And please see
                voucher for any expiry date that may apply.</li>
            <li>As with all orders, if you're not happy with any of the
                wines for any reason, we will give you your money back!</li>
        </ol>
        
       <h5 class="bold blue pt10">Naked Wines Gift Certificates</h5>
       
       <ol>
            <li>Naked Wines Gift Certificates can be bought online or over the phone, 
                to pass onto a friend. N.B. These differ to the vouchers / gift cards 
                mentioned above, which are offered by our partners as a reward or thank you.</li>
            <li>These gift certificates are like cash (i.e. can be used to buy 
                anything on the site) - and we'll send the certificate to the lucky 
                recipient via email, with full instructions on how to claim it.</li>
            <li>They can be stacked (unlike our partner vouchers / gift cards) - and 
                they can be used in conjunction with partner vouchers / gift cards.</li>
            <li>Before claiming a gift certificate, you'll have to register with us 
                first, including credit / debit card details (even if you're not spending 
                any of your own money), so we can verify your age and we know where to send 
                your wine to.</li>
            <li>As with all orders, if you're not happy with any of the
                wines for any reason, we will give you your money back!</li>
      </ol>
       
       <h5 class="bold blue pt10">We operate a fair use policy on all promotional vouchers</h5>
       
       <p>
            We honour vouchers honestly earned from our partners, but
            the majority of our money-off vouchers (and some of our gift
            vouchers) are for new customers only. So if you're an existing
            customer who has already used a voucher, you won't be able to
            redeem a second one, but you're welcome to pass it to a friend!.
            N.B. We reserve the right to close your account(s!) if we
            suspect that you are downloading and redeeming vouchers from a
            voucher site, EVEN IF you set-up multiple accounts in the name
            of your pet hamster and vole. It is just not fair on us, our
            winemakers and other customers. We reserve the right to modify or 
            cancel our vouchers/offers without notice.

                                    <h3 class="bold mb30">Standard Angel Terms and Conditions:</h3>
                                    <section class="mb10 mt10">
                                        <ol>
    <li>When you become a Naked Angel, you'll be helping our
        network of talented winemakers to make delicious wines, for
        less.</li>

    <li>You support them by investing £20 a month (or any
        multiple of £10) into your Naked Wines account towards
        your next order, yours to spend on ANY of our wines, whenever
        you want.</li>

    <li>In return for your support, you save at least 25% (and
        up to 50%) every time you order (i.e. you pay the Angel Price
        rather than the normal price listed next to each product,
        unless you're using a money-off voucher - see point 6 below).</li>
    <li>Angels are also offered a free premium bottle of wine
        every month if you order a case, while stocks last. To claim
        your free bottle, add it to your basket from your Naked Me page
        (unless we've added it already!) and checkout with at least 11
        or 12 other non-MarketPlace bottles.</li>

    <li>Please note:
        <ul>
            <li>There is no obligation to order whatsoever. You
                decide when you want to order (if at all!) and what you want
                to order.</li>

            <li>
                Your monthly payments will be transferred from your registered debit or
                credit card at the same time every month (you can change your payment
                date on your My Account page). N.B. If we cannot take your monthly
                payment from your default card for whatever reason (for example, the card
                has expired), we will attempt to auto-update your card details for you, to
                save you the bother of having to call us with updated information. Failing
                that, we will automatically take your Angel payment from another registered
                card on your account. Or finally, we will get in touch and request new card
                details! Please note, once we have new card details, we will take your
                Angel payment for that calender month and the previous calendar month,
                unless you tell us not to.
            </li>

            <li>If you place an order that totals more than the
                balance in your Naked Wines account, then we will debit your
                registered debit / credit card the difference.</li>

        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>VOUCHERS AND GIFT CARDS: If you have a promotional money-off voucher in
        your account, or a gift voucher / gift card, these are only redeemable
        against the standard price, not the Angel price, unless otherwise stated.
        N.B. If we offer you a voucher when you join our Angel waiting list, these
        are valid against the standard price whilst you're on the waiting list, OR
        the Angel price as soon as you get your wings.</li>
    <li>GIFT CERTIFICATES: As these are like money, there is no Angel discount when
        buying Naked Wines Gift Certificates BUT you will still receive your Angel
        discount when you spend a gift voucher.</li>
    <li>You can cancel your Naked Angel Account at any time, and get your money
        back - with no penalty whatsoever (see point 9). You can cancel online on
        your account page, via email at <a href="mailto:hello@nakedwines.com">hello@nakedwines.com</a> OR by calling us
        on
        01603 281869. Please note, that if you have any vouchers OR Fine Wine Bond
        Wine Credits in your account, we cannot refund these - as they are not cash
        nor are they convertible into cash. But as mentioned above, you will get
        back every unspent penny that you've paid in!</li>
    <li> In case you were wondering whether the money in your Naked Wines' account is safe; the funds are protected by
        our ultimate parent company guarantee so that if anything goes wrong with Naked Wines your money remains secure.

    </li>
    <li>
        Closing an Angels account when someone dies: we understand that it can be overwhelming to sort practical matters
        when someone close to you dies so we want to make it as simple as possible. Call us on 01603 281869 and we'll do our best to help. If the bank account linked to the Angels account is still active or
        even if frozen we can return any remaining funds immediately. If this is not possible we will require a copy of
        the death certificate and proof of executor details before we can release any funds to the executor by cheque.

<h5 class="bold blue pt10">What does Angel exclusive mean?</h5>


<p>Angel exclusive means that Angels will always get first dibs on all new products as soon as they hit the website
    (usually around four weeks). They'll also get priority access to low stock / scarce wines - and some of our most
    popular wines. Once Angels have had first dibs, these products will be released to all customers to purchase at the
    list price, however Angels will always have a chance to buy them first.</p>


<h5 class="bold blue pt10">I'm on the Angel waiting list, are there any conditions?</h5>


<p>None whatsoever. If you join the waiting list, you can leave at any point (although it means you'll be put to the
    back of the queue if you want to join again). We'll email you during your time on the waiting list to confirm your
    place on the list, remind you how it works - and let you know when your membership is due to start. Remember, once
    you become an Angel, you can cancel and get any unspent money back if it's not your cup of tea - so there's
    absolutely no risk.</p>


<p>N.B. If we offer you a reward when you join the waiting list (for example some free wine or a voucher) - any
    conditions surrounding this reward will be made clear at the time.</p>

                                        <ol>
    <li>Naked MarketPlace is a place for us to show you the
        PICK of the parcels offered to us, at the best price we can
        negotiate for you. The deals are set up so that everyone wins:
        <p>
        </p><ul>
            <li>
               You our customers get a better deal on the parcel
                than you can any other way</li>
            <li>The winemakers get a big order</li>
            <li>We take 10% for making sure everyone gets what they
                bargained for</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>How the MarketPlace deals work:
       <p>
        </p><ul>
            <li>Every week, we pick the BEST parcel, negotiate the
                BEST price with the winemaker, and put the deal live on the
                website</li>

            <li>Each deal lasts for one week and the deal ONLY goes
                through if the minimum number of cases are sold i.e. "This
                Pinot Noir usually sells for £20 a bottle in New
                Zealand, but I'll sell it to you for £10 a bottle if
                1000 of you buy a case."</li>
            <li>A deal can be a 6 or 12 bottle case of the same wine
                OR a mixture of different wines from the same winemaker</li>
            <li>The price customers see is:

            <p>
                </p><ul>
                    <li>The price negotiated by us with the winemaker</li>
                    <li>Converted into £ Sterling</li>
                    <li>Plus duty, VAT, CCT and postage and packaging</li>
                    <li>Plus commission of 10%</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Customers can bid for as many cases of the same deal
                as they like (N.B. you will need to register with Naked Wines
                to place a bid).</li>

            <li>If, when the deal ends, the number of bids exceeds
                the minimum, then the deal is binding on all parties!
                <ul>
                    <li>The seller is committed to deliver the ordered
                        volume to Naked Wines' local agent within four weeks of the
                        deal ending</li>

                    <li>Naked Wines will collect the bid price from the
                        customers i.e. the money will be taken from customers'
                        registered Naked Wines' card OR we'll use any cash already
                        in your Naked account</li>

                    <li>And Naked Wines will pay the pitch price, in local
                        currency, at the exchange rate prevailing, within 10 days
                        of the seller delivering the wine and export documentation
                        to Naked Wines' specified agent.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>If the deal expires and the minimum volume has not
                been achieved, then nothing happens. The seller does not
                deliver the wine, get any money OR get charged any money -
                and the customer is not charged anything and does not receive
                any wine.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Refunds: Our money back guarantee still applies to our
        MarktetPlace wines i.e. if you don't enjoy it, or it's faulty
        for any reason, we'll give you a full refund</li>

    <li>Angels: There is no additional Angel discount on
        MarketPlace cases as they already have HUGE discounts - and
        most of the winemakers don't need Angel backing as the majority
        of the wines are already made.</li>

    <li>Delivery: Delivery is included in the price that you
        bid - so there's no extra delivery charge to pay. N.B. Out of
        area postcodes will be charged their standard delivery charge,
        less £5.</li>

    <li>Vouchers: You cannot use vouchers on these cases as
        they already have HUGE discounts - and the transaction is
        really between you and the winemaker, not between you and Naked
        Wines.</li>

    <li>Please note that when we ship you your case, we cannot add

    <li>This service will runs <span>(Mon-Fri 9am-5:30pm, Sat 9am-1pm)</span> - and we'll aim to reply to all texts within 20 minutes.</li>

    <li>The beauty of the service is you can ask us to order you a specific case OR you can tell us the types of wines you like and we'll create a case for you.</li>
    <li>We'll use the default card on your account to pay for your order (or any account balance), and we'll deliver to your standard delivery address unless you tell us otherwise. Delivery charges are free if you spend <span>£100</span> or more, otherwise £4.99.</li>

</p>

<ol>
    <li>Every Angel is invited to send a welcome deal to their friends who don't currently shop with Naked Wines, via email,
        Facebook and Twitter.</li>
    <li>This deal may vary, but you can find the details via the 'Invite a friend' link in the menu once logged-in, or by visiting
        <a href="/invite">www.nakedwines.com/invite</a>.
    </li>
    <li>You can send the deal to as many friends as you like, as often as you like, but your friends will only be able to redeem
        the deal if they're new to Naked Wines.</li>
    <li>By inviting a friend, you confirm that you have their consent for us to email them their offer code, plus one reminder.
        They have 30 days to claim - after that, we’ll delete their data.</li>
    <li>If your friend decides to take up the deal, they're under no obligation to buy again or become an Angel (but we will
        invite them to become one!)</li>
    <li>For every friend that orders off the back of your invite, we will credit your Naked Wines account with
        <span>£</span>10 as soon as their order is shipped.</li>
    <li>This
        <span>£</span>10 credit is like cash i.e. it has no minimum spend and can be used against any products on the website.</li>
    <li>N.B. If you decide to cancel your Naked Wines account, this money won't be refunded to you (just any unspent money you've
        paid in yourself).</li>
    <li>Please note, Naked Wines reserves the right to withdraw the
        <span>£</span>10 credit offer at any time, or change the amount (but if the deal changes, we will make it clear on the
        'Invite a friend' page).</li>
</ol>

<p>
    <strong>To the person receiving an invite:</strong>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>If you're new to Naked Wines, you're welcome to redeem any 'Invite a friend' deal sent to you by an existing Naked Wines
        customer.
    </li>
    <li>If you have been invited, we'll send you an email with an offer, and one further email reminder. If you don't claim the
        offer, we'll remove your information from our database after 30 days.</li>
    <li>The details and conditions of the deal will be explained in the invite.</li>
    <li>The deal cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer or voucher.</li>
    <li>If you take up the deal, you're under no obligation to buy again or become an Angel (i.e. a member), but we will invite
        you to become an one.</li>
    <li>If you do decide to order and you don't like the wines, the service or anything else, you're entitled to a full refund
        as part of our money-back-guarantee.</li>

<p>
    We use a third party provider, Adestra, to deliver our marketing emails. We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies.
</p>


<p>
    Open tracking uses a one pixel by one pixel clear GIF image, which is stored as a temporary file on the user's computer or mobile device. When this image is downloaded, Adestra registers the email recipient as having opened an email. This is not used for any other tracking, except for tracking an email open.

    By registering on our website, you are consenting to us tracking when you open an email. For more information, please see Adestra's privacy policy and cookie policy.

    <li>Our Wine Concierge service is the perfect solution for busy folk who’d like someone to do their wine shopping
        for them.</li>
    <li>It’s our job to make sure you have a wine rack full of wines you’re going to love, and as a Wine Concierge
        member, you only pay us when we get it right (if we offer you 'Try Before You Buy' - more on that below!).</li>
    <li>You can sit back and let us do everything for you, or you can be really specific if you want to.</li>
    <li>
        The sit back route:
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pop you name on the Wine Concierge list
            </li>
            <li>
                We’ll send you a case of wines to get you started
            </li>
            <li>
                If we know what you enjoy, we’ll customise the wines to your taste…
            </li>
            <li>
                ...if not, we’ll send you some crowd-pleasing customer favourites
            </li>
            <li>
                You drink them (the hard part)
            </li>
            <li>
                And ideally you tell us what you think (with just a couple of clicks)
            </li>
            <li>
                We’ll only bill you for the wines you’ve told us you love (if we offer you ‘Try Before You Buy’ - more
                on that below)
            </li>
            <li>
                And when you’re running low, we’ll send you your next case to enjoy…
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

            <li>
                All of the above! But you can hop online and give us more specific instructions:
            </li>
            <li>
                How frequently you want to receive a case (every 1, 2 or 3 months)
            </li>
            <li>
                Whether you want to receive a mixed, all red or all whites case

            <li>
                An indication of the kind of price you’re comfortable paying

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <p>A few practical bits...</p>

    <li>
        We’ll send your wine to your default delivery address (which you can update at any time <a href="/account/addresses">here</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
        If the timing isn't right, you’re welcome to postpone or skip your case. Plus, if you don’t like the sound of
        the wines we’ve chosen for you, you can edit your case online or by contacting our Customer Happiness Team
        before we pop them in the post.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are no tie-ins or contracts, and you can cancel your membership at any time. Plus our usual money-back
        guarantee applies i.e. you only pay for wines you love
    </li>
    <li>
        We also reserve the right to cancel your Concierge membership at any point if we don't think we're right for one
        another.

<p class="bold">What will my Wine Concierge cases cost?</p>

<p>
    If you're on 'Try Before You Buy', you've got nothing to pay upfront! We'll bill you 30 days after we've created your order (or the day after you’ve been online and told us what you think of all the wines in your case, if
    earlier), and then you'll pay the list price for each of the wines in your case. If you're an Angel and pay £20 a
    month into your Naked Wines account (or if you become an Angel), then you get preferential prices and you pay the
    Angel price for each of the wines in your case.
</p>

<p>
    When you pop your name down for Wine Concierge, we’ll ask you to tell us the average amount you typically spend on a
    bottle: between £7 and £10, between £10 and £15, or over £15, and every time you need a top up, we’ll suggest a case
    we think you’re going to love based on these price-points and your personal preferences. If the price of the
    recommended case is too much (or too little), we can change your case for you.
</p>

<p>
    N.B. If you’re a Majestic customer invited to get Naked, you'll also be entitled to Angel prices.
</p>

<p class="bold">
    What’s the delivery charge?
</p>

<p>
    Most Wine Concierge cases come with free delivery! If you’re new to Naked Wines or if you’re an existing customer
    ordering a 6-bottle Wine Concierge welcome pack, you may be asked to pay delivery on your first case depending on
    the case size and offer. The delivery charge will be made clear at the time of purchase.
</p>

<p class="bold">
    What if I want to change the frequency or size of my cases?
</p>

<p>
    As above, you can change the case size, colour, frequency and price-settings of your Wine Concierge cases in your
    account page here. Or you can drop us a line and we’ll do it for you.
</p>

<p class="bold">
    How are you so confident you’ll send me wines I’m going to love?
</p>

<p>
    Every time you use our website or app to tell us whether you’d buy one of our wines again or not, we get to know you
    and your tastes a little bit better. If you’ve been with us for a while, we’ve created a whizzy algorithm based on
    your personal preferences, that does all the thinking for you - and picks wines you’ve already told us you love OR
    wines with a similar style profile. Equally, it avoids wines you’ve told us you didn’t enjoy - and those that are
    similar.
</p>

<p>
    If you’re new to Naked Wines, the more you tell us what you enjoy, the better the recommendations going forward! So
    please download our app or hop onto your Naked Me page to give your wines a thumbs up or thumbs down.
</p>

<p>
    N.B. Our app is currently available to Angels only.
</p>

<p class="bold">
    Will I still get all of my Angel perks alongside my Concierge cases?
</p>

<p>
    If you’re an Angel, you’ll only ever pay Angel prices - both on your Wine Concierge cases and when you make ad-hoc
    purchases yourself! Plus, you’ll still be offered a free sample every month (which you’re welcome to claim on
    non-Concierge orders as usual), get first dibs on new parcels - and keep all your other perks.
</p>

<p>
    N.B. You won’t be able to add your free bottle to your Concierge cases as our warehouse team pick and pack these
    cases separately.
</p>

<p class="bold">
    Try Before You Buy
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        As part of our Wine Concierge service, we will offer some customers the option to Try Before You Buy, on both
        their welcome case and ongoing cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        What’s Try Before You Buy? It’s exactly as it sounds! You buy a case of wine, you pay a delivery charge if it
        applies, you drink the wines and tell us what you think, and we’ll only charge you for those you love.
    </li>
    <li>
        Why are we offering this? You’re putting your trust in us... and letting us do your shopping for you. So it
        seems only fair you try before you part with your hard-earned cash!
    </li>
    <li>
        How do we know what you enjoyed? Download our app where you can scan and tell us what you think of your wines
        (or hop onto your Naked Me page on the site) - and give each of your wines a thumbs up OR a thumbs down. For
        every wine you give a thumbs down to, we knock the price off the total to pay - and we make sure we never send
        it to you again (or anything similar!). N.B. Our app is currently available to Angels only.
    </li>
    <li>
        At what point do we take payment? We’ll take payment 30 days after your order is created, OR at the point you’ve used
        our website or app to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to all of your wines, whichever is the earliest. If you’ve
        not had a chance to drink and tell us what you think of all of your wines within 30 days, we will take payment
        on the 30th day, but our usual commitment still applies, i.e. if you tell us you didn’t enjoy something at a
        later date, we will give you your money back.
    </li>
    <li>
        Where will we take payment from? We will take payment from your registered debit / credit card, in combination with any Angel balance or credit you may have on your account. We’ll give you
        the heads up before processing the transaction - and will let you know once we’ve taken the monies. If for any
        reason we can’t take payment (i.e. your card has expired for example), we’ll use any back-up cards registered on
        your account or we’ll be in touch to request new card details.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you’re offered Try Before You Buy, but you’d prefer to pay what you owe upfront, you can edit your payment
        settings by giving us a call, after you've received your sign-up case. And don’t worry, we will still offer you
        your money back if you pay for something you don’t love!

    </li>
    <li>If we’ve offered you an introductory case for a total spend of £4.99* (equivalent to our standard delivery
        charge), you will only pay that amount for the wines in that case, including the delivery charge.
        <br> *Or the cost
        of our standard delivery charge</li>
    <li>
        Please note: we reserve the right to withdraw our offer of Try Before You Buy at any point and we reserve the
        right to take funds earlier than the 30th day if we see fit.

    </li>
    <li>
        If you’re not offered Try Before You Buy, you will pay for your Wine Concierge cases at the point your wine
        ships. But rest assured, our standard money back guarantee still stands, i.e. we will refund you for anything
        that isn’t your cup of tea - so there’s still absolutely no risk!
    </li>
</ol>

    <p>
        Naked Wines UK is committed to respecting and protecting our customers' privacy and treats it with the same respect as our wine selection. This policy applies where we are acting as a data controller with respect to your personal data, in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of such personal data. It captures personal data entered across all channels: through our website, app, or via our Customer Happiness / Wine Advisor Team.
    </p>
    <p>
        We incorporate marketing preferences in your online account, which affect how we will process your personal data. By using the marketing preferences functionality, you can specify whether you would like to receive direct marketing communications and limit the use of your information. You can access the marketing preferences via <a href="/account/communicationpreferences" target="_blank">www.nakedwines.com/account/communicationpreferences</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. 
    </p>

    <h5 class="blue"><strong>2. How we use your personal data</strong></h5>

    <p>
        In this section we outline how we may process your personal data. All personal data we process falls into one or more of the following categories:
    </p>

        can exercise your right to object.

This internal social data is public, and may be processed for the purposes of enabling interaction on the website or app between customers, winemakers and staff, and providing feedback to our winemakers on their products. We may also use your posts or reviews in our marketing materials to help us tell other customers about our products and services. In instances where internal social data is stored in an unstructured format (such as free text reviews and wall posts) it is exempt from our data retention rules, however may be deleted upon request. The legal basis for processing internal social data is consent.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may process data about your use of our website or app, and reaction to our emails and services ("<strong>usage data</strong>"). The usage data may include your geographical location, browser type and version, operating system, referral source, length of visit, page views and website navigation paths, as well as information about the timing, frequency and pattern of your service use and your ratings. The sources of the usage data are our analytics packages (including, but not limited to Google Analytics) and email service providers. This usage data may be processed for the purposes of analysing the use of the website, emails and services. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely monitoring and improving our website and services. Your usage data may also be used to personalise offers and messages to you.

The legal basis for this processing is performance of a contract for service notifications and legitimate interests for direct marketing communications.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may process information contained in any enquiry you submit to us regarding goods and/or services ("<strong>enquiry data</strong>"). This enquiry data may be processed for the purposes of providing clarification, resolving issues or marketing relevant goods and/or services to you. The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract between you and us and to ensure we are responding to your enquiry.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may process information that you provide to us for the purpose of improving our marketing ("<strong> marketing data</strong>"). We may use marketing data in a number of different ways: either to advertise our products and services to you on third party websites such as Facebook or via post, or to advertise our products and services to similar customers (lookalikes) on third party websites such as Facebook. We may also use marketing data to exclude you from seeing  advertisements from third party websites such as Facebook or from receiving our advertisements via post. The marketing data may include your name, email address, billing address, phone number, date of birth, gender, and the user ID of any social platforms you have connected with us on.

    <p>

The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely the protection and assertion of our legal rights, your legal rights and the legal rights of others.
    </p>

    </p>
    
    <p>
        Please do not supply any other person's personal data to us, unless we prompt you to do so. If you do share your friends’ details with us, please ensure you have their authorisation.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blue"><strong>3. Providing your personal data to others</strong></h5>

    <p>
        We do not, and will not, sell any of your personal data to any third party – including your name, address, email address or credit card information. We want to earn and maintain your trust, and we believe this is absolutely essential in order do that.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, we may disclose your personal data with the following categories of companies as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you, as set out in this policy:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>to any member of our group of companies (this means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and all its subsidiaries) insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes, and on the legal bases, set out in this policy;</li>

        <li>to our insurers and professional advisers insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes of obtaining or maintaining insurance coverage, managing risks, obtaining professional advice;</li>

        <li>to companies approved by you, such as Facebook and other social media sites (if you choose to link your accounts to us);</li>

        <li>to companies that we engage to provide database profiling and de-duping services to give us insights about our existing and potential customers;</li>

        <li>to companies that do things to get your wine orders to you, such as warehouses, order packers and delivery companies; and</li>

        <li>to deliver exciting news and offers to you we will use postal printing and mailing, as well as email and third party marketing service providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Financial transactions relating to our website, app and stores are handled by our card payment service providers. We will share transaction data with our payment service providers only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing your payments, refunding such payments and dealing with complaints and queries relating to such payments and refunds.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will also disclose your information to third parties:
        </p><ul>
            <li>in the event that we take steps to sell or merge any of our business or assets (including by way of merger, share or asset sale), in which case we will disclose your data to the prospective buyer or merged entity; or</li>
            <li>if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case information held by us about you will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>
        In addition to the specific disclosures of personal data set out in this Section 3, we may disclose your personal data with law enforcement and fraud prevention agencies, so we can help tackle fraud or where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person, or in connection with the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative out-of-court procedure.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blue"><strong>4. Transfers outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)</strong></h5>

    <p>
        We have model clauses in place across our group of companies, listed in our most recent annual report: <a href="https://www.majesticwineplc.co.uk" target="_blank">www.majesticwineplc.co.uk</a>. Your data could be processed by our staff working outside the EEA, in particular the United States of America and Australia.  We will take all reasonable steps to ensure your information is treated securely and in line with this policy. You acknowledge that personal data that you submit for publication through our website, for example wine reviews, may be available, via the internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use (or misuse) of such personal data by others.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blue"><strong>5. How long we retain your data</strong></h5>

    <p>
        Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have claimed a voucher but not subsequently purchased from us, we will retain your data for 3 months, from the point at which the voucher was claimed, to give you sufficient time to benefit from the offer. 
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have registered on our website but not purchased from us, the length of time we will retain your data is dependent upon whether you have opted into our marketing communications. If you have opted in, we will retain your data for 2 years since your last interaction; if you have not opted in, we will retain your data for 30 days from registration. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Whilst you are an active customer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, means you have purchased from us) we will retain your data for as long as needed to give you the best possible customer service. We will anonymise your personal data 7 years after your last transaction (sale, refund or Angel payment) provided you have not interacted with us for 2 years. For the purposes of this policy, an interaction is defined as an identifiable website or app session, or contacting our Customer Happiness / Wine Advisor Team. We will inform you before we anonymise your data and give you the option for us to retain your details so we can continue to serve you.
    </p>

    <p>
        As long as you have an Angel balance or are a Bondholder we will always retain your data. 
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have submitted somebody else’s data (with their authorisation) as part of our “invite a friend” promotion, we will retain their data for 30 days to give them sufficient time to claim the offer, and to enable us to reward you for the referral. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In all instances outlined above, the process of anonymising your data may take up to one calendar month. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In certain circumstances we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blue"><strong>6. Your rights</strong></h5>
    
    <p>
        You have a number of rights in respect to your personal data.  We have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights. You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by either (a)  emailing us on <a href="mailto:help@nakedwines.com"><span class="blue">help@nakedwines.com</span></a> or <a href="mailto:dataprotection@majestic.co.uk">dataprotection@majestic.co.uk</a>, or (b) calling our Customer Happiness Team.
    </p>

    <p><u>A. Right of access</u><br>
        You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge. In order to fulfil this right we will ask for government registered ID to confirm your identity and, once this is received, will respond with the relevant information one calendar month from the date of your request.
    </p>

    <p><u>B. Right to rectification</u><br>
        You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.
    </p>

    <p><u>C. Right to erasure</u><br>
        In certain circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure, such as where processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. If you have entered into a transaction with us, we will keep a record of your personal data for 7 years following the date of your last transaction with us. We will endeavor to respond to your request within one month, but if your request is complex or we receive a number of similar requests at the same time, it might take us longer, in which case we will inform you within one month of the receipt of the request and explain why we think an extension is necessary.
    </p>

    <p><u>D. Right to restriction on processing</u><br>
        In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: (a) you contest the accuracy of the personal data, (b) processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure, (c) we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, and (d) you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: (a) with your consent, (b) for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, (c) for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person, or (d) for reasons of important public interest.
    </p>

    <p><u>E. Right to objection to processing</u><br>
        You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: (a) the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or (b) the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless (a) we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or (b) the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
    </p>

    <p>
        You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
    </p>

    <p><u>F. Right to data portability</u><br>
        In certain circumstances, you have the right to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit that information to another controller to enable it to use the data. The right to data portability applies (a) to personal data you have provided to us as data controller, (b) where the processing is based on the your consent or for the performance of a contract and (c) when processing is carried out by automated means. If you request this information, we will transmit the data directly to another controller, if this is technically feasible. We are, however, not required to adopt or maintain processing systems that are technically compatible with other controllers. Also, if the personal data concerns more than one individual, we must consider whether providing the information would prejudice the rights of other individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you exercise your right to data portability, we will endeavor to respond to your request within one month, but if your request is complex or we receive a number of similar requests at the same time, it might take us longer, in which case we will inform you within one month of the receipt of the request and explain why we think an extension is necessary.
    </p>

    <p><u>G. Right to stop marketing messages</u><br>
        At any time you can amend your marketing preferences to reduce, remove or increase the amount we contact you with direct marketing communications. You can do this by accessing your account here: <a href="/account/communicationpreferences" target="_blank">www.nakedwines.com/account/communicationpreferences</a>
    </p>

    <p><u>H. Right to withdraw consent</u><br>
        To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. 
    </p>

    <p><u>I. Right to complain</u><br>
        In the event that you wish to make a complaint about how we process your personal data, please contact us in the first instance at <a href="mailto:help@nakedwines.com"><span class="blue">help@nakedwines.com</span></a> and we will endeavour to deal with your request as soon as possible. If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. Our supervisory authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office.

    As part of the recruitment process Naked Wines Ltd will process any personal data you have provided for the purposes of considering
    you for suitable employment vacancies, communicating with you at various stages in the selection process, for on-boarding
    successful applicants and for retaining the applications of unsuccessful applicants in the form of a “talent pool” database.
    Naked Wines Ltd will be acting as Data Controller for these purposes.
</p>

<p>
    The legal basis for our processing your information is the pursuit of our legitimate interests which are seeking job applicants
    in order to further the interests of our organisation and maintaining a database of unsuccessful candidates and speculative
    enquiries known as a talent pool. We will not process the information you have provided for any other purposes incompatible
    with those referred to above.
</p>

<p>
    We will not share or disclose your personal data to anyone else.
</p>

<p>
    The information you provide to us through this form and subsequently during the application process will be stored in our
    computer systems for a period of 365 days. You have the right to request access to, rectification or erasure of personal
    data that we hold about you as well as a right to object to and to a restriction of our processing of your personal data
    for the purposes described above. You may also lodge a complaint about us with the supervisory authority responsible
    for data protection.

					<div class="col col__sm--6">
						<p>Here's a juicy little nugget of insider info…</p>
						<p><strong>When it comes to wine, a small step in price = a HUGE leap in quality and taste</strong></p>
						<p>By spending <span>£</span>8-<span>£</span>10 for a bottle of wine, you're actually getting more than DOUBLE the quality of wine than a <span>£</span>6-<span>£</span>7 bottle …pretty impressive huh?</p>
						<p><strong>Sound too good to be true? It's not. Here's how it works…</strong></p>
						<p>As the price of a bottle increases, more of your money goes towards the delicious juice in the bottle rather than tax, duty and other boring stuff that adds nothing to the taste.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col col__sm--6">
						<p><strong>So you get a LOT more bang for your buck</strong></p>
						<p>These Sweet Spot wines have benefited from the very best fruit picked from immaculate vineyards, oodles of TLC, and a lil' extra Angel-funding at every step of the winemaking process.</p>
						<p><strong>Pull yer socks up. Because if these Sweet Spot beauties don't blow 'em off I don't know what will</strong></p>
						<p>I guarantee our Sweet Spot wines will blow you away. If they don't, then I'll give you every single penny back. So you've really got nothing to lose.</p>
