			internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service 
			provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time 
			stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, track user's movement

			aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to any personal 
			identifiable information.<br>
			<br>
&nbsp;<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<br>
			This site does not use cookies. However, Advertising services such 
			Google Adsense use cookies on<br>
			zahraaa.info. We have no access to and can not control these 
			cookies.<br>
			<br>
			What is a Cookie?<br>
			<br>
			A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website 
			transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard 
			disk so that the website can remember who you are.<br>
			<br>
			A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which 
			the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, 
			usually a randomly generated unique number.<br>
			<br>
			Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your 
			preferred interests more quickly. Most major websites use cookies. 
			Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you.<br>
			<br>
			There are two different types of cookies:<br>
			<br>
			1) Session Cookies: These are temporary and are erased when you 
			close your browser at the end of your surfing session. The next time 
			you visit that particular site it will not recognise you and will 
			treat you as a completely new visitor as there is nothing in your 
			browser to let the site know that you have visited before.<br>
			<br>
			2) Persistent Cookies: These remain on your hard drive until you 
			erase them or they expire. How long a cookie remains on your browser 
			depends on how long the visited website has programmed the cookie to 
			last.<br>
			<br>
&nbsp;<h3>Beacons</h3>
			<br>
			This site does not use beacons. However, Advertising services such 
			Google Adsense use cookies on<br>
			zahraaa.info. We have no access to and can not control these beacon 
			logs.<br>
			<br>
			What is a Beacon?<br>
			<br>
			A beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey 
			around a single website or collection of sites. They are also 
			referred to as web bugs and are commonly used by sites that hire 
			third-party services to monitor traffic. They may be used in 
			association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with 
			the pages and content on the pages of a web site.<br>
			<br>
			For example a company owning a network of sites may use web beacons 
			to count and recognise users travelling around its network. Being 
			able to recognise you enables the site owner to personalise your 
			visit and make it more user friendly.<br>
			<br>
