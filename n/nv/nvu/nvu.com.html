			  <font class="BodyText1"> Linspire, Inc. ("Linspire," "we," "us") shares your concerns about the protection of your personal information online. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes our practices regarding the collection and use of information through our website, located at www.linspire.com, any of our micro sites and any web pages viewable through our CNR software application (collectively, the "Site"). By using the Site or obtaining any product or service through this Site, you agree to the collection and use of information as set forth in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Site.<br><br>
We may from time to time update this Policy. We will notify you of changes to the Policy by posting the updated Policy on this page. We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of the Policy. You can determine when this Policy was last revised bychecking the "Effective Date of Current Policy" legend at the top of the Policy. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <strong>What Information We Collect</strong><br> 
			  
      Linspire collects two types of information during your visits to our Site.         
			  <br>
           <br>                        
			  First, we collect non-personally identifiable information. When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which links were "clicked." Collecting such information involves logging the IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the Site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, it may be possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of the visitor's point of connectivity.	
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  We also use "cookies" and other tracking technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information regarding you. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. Cookies make it possible for us to recognize your browser when you visit our Site. By doing this, we can personalize your return visits and save you time during login and checkout. Your browser must be set to accept cookies in order for you to enjoy the benefits of being a registered user of the Site. <br>
			  <br>
			  Second, we collect personal and personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, credit card number and information concerning software downloaded, products and content purchased, accessed and/or downloaded through our products and services. <br>
			  <br>
			  <strong>How We Use Collected Information</strong><br>Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways that Linspire uses the information that we gather. Keep in mind that, while we encourage all third parties involved in running our business to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and to otherwise handle personally identifiable information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from Linspire or independently. <br>
			  <br>
			  <strong><i>Non-personally identifiable information</i></strong><br>Linspire uses non-personally identifiable information, such as your IP address and the pages that you visit on our Site, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Site and improve Site-related services and features. Your IP address and other non-personally identifiable information also may be used to gather broad demographic information and to recognize customer traffic patterns and Site usage trends. This information aids us in merchandising and in developing the design and layout of the Site.<br><br>
Linspire may also collect diagnostic information and hardware specifications in order to provide you with support and troubleshooting services. <br>
			  <br>
			  In addition, the very first time a Linspire computer starts up, our CNR software application checks in with our server to look for updates and security patches. At that time, we record information such as the IP address and product specification information, including the version numbers of our operating system and CNR software application, the language type, and a builder ID number (which identifies the builder that provided you with the software).  Also at this time, CNR assigns a random number to your computer. All of this information is recorded for purposes of paying royalties and licenses to third party providers, for marketing purposes, and for enforcing our policies and procedures.<br><br>
We also may share aggregated statistical data and other non-personally identifiable information with our current and potential business partners, and with our service providers. 
  <br>
			  <br>
			  <strong><i>Personally identifiable information</i></strong><br>Linspire uses personally identifiable information collected from you to: <br>
 <ul>
   <li>
complete transactions initiated by you (such as the sale and delivery of products and services)</li>
<li>provide support services</li>
<li>get in touch with you when necessary</li>
<li>contact you to make sure you are satisfied with our goods and services or to find out how we can serve you better</li>
<li>conduct in-depth marketing research regarding our customers and potential customers</li>
