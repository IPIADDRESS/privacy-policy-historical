        HOW WE SAFEGUARD YOUR INFORMATION<br>
        </span></strong>We employ reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect against the loss of, or unauthorized access to, the information under our control. Steps we’ve taken to enhance network and information security include the implementation of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology for payment transactions, digital certificates, password protection for all web applications that contain personal information, and industry standard infrastructure security.&nbsp; Although we take measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that your information will always remain secure.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
        Password Protection: </span><br>
        All our web applications that deal with your personal information require a username and password to gain access. This allows us to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access. You should not divulge this username and password to anyone.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
        CHILDREN </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong><br>
        Visit does not intend to receive personal data directly from minors.&nbsp; We assume the people purchasing our services, and making inquiries at our websites, are not minors.&nbsp; If a minor provides us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, then the parent or guardian can contact Visit to have the minor’s personal information deleted (see the section titled “<strong>CONTACT US</strong>” below).</p>

        YOUR RIGHTS </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong><br>
        You have certain legal rights, which are briefly summarised below, in relation to any personal data about you which we hold.</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="text-align: left;">Where our processing of your personal data is based on your <strong>consent</strong>, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you do decide to withdraw your consent we will stop processing your personal data for that purpose, unless there is another lawful basis we can rely on – in which case, we will let you know. Your withdrawal of your consent won’t impact any of our processing up to that point. </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">Where our processing of your personal data is necessary for our <strong>legitimate interests</strong>, you can object to this processing at any time. If you do this, we will need to show either a compelling reason why our processing should continue, which overrides your interests, rights and freedoms or that the processing is necessary for us to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim. </li>
