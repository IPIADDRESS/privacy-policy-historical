("Nextag" or "we") operates the website <a href="http://www.nextag.com.au">www.nextag.com.au</a> and permutations of that site, including certain co-branded versions of that site with third parties, that refer to this Website Privacy Policy in a direct hyperlink(the "Websites"). Nextag respects your privacy and we want you to be confident in sharing your information with us. This Website Privacy Policy is designed to inform you of the types of information we collect from users, how we use that information, and the circumstances under which we will share it with third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Websites. It does not apply to your use of any other websites (whether or not operated by us), including any websites to which we provide links or websites of our partners or advertisers, or to any activities which are not online.</p><p>Please note that some features and/or services referenced may not be available on some Websites. Therefore, portions of this Privacy Policy that pertain to such features or services may not be applicable on each of the Websites.</p> <div> <p>This Website Privacy Policy is effective as of the date listed above. Even if you read and/or agreed to a prior privacy policy, you need to review this updated version. We reserve the right to revise this Website Privacy Policy at any time and at our discretion. If we decide to change our Website Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Website Privacy Policy accessible on the homepages of the Websites, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via either email or by posting a notice on the Websites for 30 days. </p><p></p><div class="dr"><b><li>Personal Information and How We Use It</li></b></div><p></p><p>Generally it is possible to use some features on the Websites without providing us with any personally identifiable information, but on some of our Websites, users have the option of providing personal information to make the best use of available services and features and certain services and features require that you provide personal information. This section describes what we collect and how we use it. Providing the information is always voluntary, however, and you can always choose not to provide the information by choosing not to use the service or feature. By providing the information you agree to our use consistent with this Privacy Policy. </p><p></p><div class="dr"><b>INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU</b></div><p></p><blockquote><p><b>E-mail Address:</b> On some of the Websites if you wish to register for either Price Alerts (through our Watch List feature) or our Buyer's Alert Newsletter or provide product reviews, or be matched with participating service providers, we require that you provide us with your email address. We will use this to email you with the Price Alert, the Buyer's Alert Newsletter, and other information or service provider match results you may have requested.</p><p><b>Basic Contact Information:</b> On some of the Websites you may be able to become a registered user. When you decide to become a registered user, we ask for some basic contact information, such as username, and email address. We use this basic contact information to facilitate the use of certain features of our Websites (e.g., TruePrice prices, submission of product/merchant reviews and creation of lists) and to send you information about our company, services and products, and, subject to your consent acquired in accordance with the Communications Policy described below, to communicate occasional offers from our partners and advertisers.</p><p><b>Complete Contact Information:</b> On some of the Websites a registered user may decide to become a merchant. When registering as a merchant, we collect complete contact information, i.e., full name, address, e-mail address, and phone number, as well as credit card number and expiration date. We use this information to validate the merchant's identity and to bill the merchant for services provided by Nextag and approved in advance by the merchant. All credit card information is encrypted.</p><p><b>Content or Correspondence Submitted By You:</b> If you choose to post content on any of the Websites where posting is available (for example, a product or merchant review), or submit personal correspondence to Nextag, we may collect and maintain that information in a file specific to you.</p><p><b>Lists:</b> Some of the Websites allow you to create lists of products that are interesting to you. The default for certain lists is for the list to be publicly available. Publicly available lists will include your user name. You may change the privacy setting of your lists as provided on the Websites.</p></blockquote><p></p><div class="dr"><b>INFORMATION ACQUIRED AUTOMATICALLY</b></div><p></p><p>We collect certain information on the Websites through your experience and activities, cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or use of third party websites to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences, activities and interactions with Nextag. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to the Websites, and, subject to the Communications Policy stated below, to direct pertinent marketing promotions and communications to them. </p><blockquote><p><b>Cookies:</b> A cookie is a piece of data tied to information about the user and stored on the user's computer. We use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted. Cookies are used to help make your use of our Websites more enjoyable. Nextag creates these cookie files on your hard drive through your browser and uses them to save information on your Nextag username and Website preferences so you can avoid re-entry of this information each time you visit our Websites, and to display certain usage information that may be helpful for you, such as your recent searches and recently viewed items. Cookies also help us to deliver content and advertisements specific to your interests. For example, we may use cookies to collect anonymous information about your use of our sites and services (including your browsing history, the terms you searched, the products you viewed, etc.) and your interaction with our advertisements that are served on the Websites or other sites. We also may allow our advertising partners to use cookies to collect this kind of anonymous information. This information is not associated with your personally identifiable information. We or our advertising partners may use this anonymous use and browsing information to customize your experience on the Websites, to improve the Websites and our services such as by analysing what content or services are helpful or interesting to users, or to provide you with advertisements that are tailored to your interests, both on our sites and on third-party sites. We also may provide your anonymous use and browsing information to third parties to allow them to provide you with advertisements that are tailored to your interests. You may decline our cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies, although this may prevent you from accessing certain features on our Websites. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting to refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you access our site. Further information about how to manage cookies is available from the website <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>, produced by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry body that develops standards and guidelines to support online business processes. If you would like help on clearing your cookies, consult your browser's Help directory, or visit: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/page-2">http://www.aboutcookies.org/page-2 </a>.</p><p>We may collect information about your interaction with our advertisements. To opt-out of these advertising cookies, please <a rel="nofollow" href="/info/privacyPolicy">click here</a>. </p><p>We may allow advertising partners to record that you have visited the Websites to allow us to provide you with relevant advertising on the partners' sites.  To opt-out of these partner advertising cookies, please <a rel="nofollow" href="/info/privacyPolicy">click here</a></p><p><b>Log Files:</b> Like most standard website servers we use log files. These include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyse trends, administer the Web site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Should you register with a Website, we may use your IP address at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our Websites. We do not tie log files to personally identifiable information.</p><p><b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs):</b> We and/or our third party advertisers employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs). They help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content and which campaigns are effective. Clear gifs are similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In addition, Nextag and its advertisers may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our communications and our marketing campaigns by showing how many emails recipients have opened. We also utilize clear gifs to enable Nextag or third parties to provide you with advertisements, both on our sites and on third-party sites, that are tailored to your interests. We do not tie web-beacons to personally identifiable information.</p></blockquote><p></p><div class="dr"><b>PEOPLE UNDER 18 YEARS OLD</b></div>Our Websites are not intended for use by people under eighteen (18) years of age.
