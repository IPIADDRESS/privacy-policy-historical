<p><strong>6.  Sharing of Your Information</strong></p>
<p>It is our policy not to share the  information about you with third parties except with commissioned data  processors of NEXON. We may share your information with the below stated commissioned  data processors for certain purposes, including for the purpose of explaining  our user demographics or improving the quality or delivery of our Services or  providing platform services or for providing you with proper functioning of the  Services. Although we will not share the information about you with third  parties for the purpose of enabling third parties to send marketing materials  to you about their products or the products of others, we may use third party  advertisers to deliver advertising within the NEXON Servicing environment.<br>
  <br>
  Please be informed that NEXON and  Third Party Platform Provider reserves the right to contact you at any time  using the information about you for administrative or billing-related issues.</p>
<p>If you do not want us to share the  information about you with the third parties set forth below for particular  purposes as described, please see Section 7 below, “Your Choices”, or do not  provide us any information about you or use our Services.</p>
<p><strong>Commissioned  Data Processors.</strong> We may use third party service providers, commissioned data processors, such as  licensors/developers of our Services, Third Party Platform Providers, and  analytics companies, to help us provide or improve the Services we offer you.  We may share information about you with these commissioned data processors so  that they may provide their services to us and you in order to allow a proper  functioning of the Services. Some of these commissioned data processors are  located outside the territories of the European Union (EU)/European Economic  Area (EEA), which may not provide the same adequate protection for personal  data as the EU. The commissioned data processors located outside of EU/EEA are  the following: (i) Nexon Korea Corporation, having its principal place of  business at 7 Pangyo-ro 256 beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do,  Korea; (ii) Nexon America Inc., having its principal place of business at 222  N. Sepulveda Blvd, Suite 300, El Segundo, CA 90245, United States of America  (“Nexon America”); and (iii) Valve Corporation, having its postal address at P.O.  Box 1688<br>
  Bellevue, WA 98004, United States of America (“Valve”).</p>
<p><strong>Other  NEXON Users.</strong> Some  of the information about you (included in your profile and nicknames) may also  be visible to other NEXON users through the use of the Site, Services or  through other related websites. Other NEXON users may be able to view  information about your uses and interactions, such as your game results,  scores, and profile information.</p>
<p><strong>Legal  Purposes.</strong> We may  provide information about you to third parties or commissioned data processors  where we have a good faith belief that doing so is required by law or to  cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities. We may also provide  your information to third parties in order to protect the rights or property of  a third party or NEXON, including for the purposes of enforcing our Terms.</p>
<p><strong>Health  or Safety.</strong> We may  share the information about you when we have a good faith belief that there is  an emergency that poses a threat to the health or safety of you, another  person, or the public generally.</p>
<p><strong>Sale  or Merger.</strong> If  NEXON is involved in a major business transition, such as a merger, acquisition  by another company, or sale of its assets, we may transfer the information  about you to the successor organization in such transition. If material changes  to NEXON’s privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition,  we will amend the Privacy Policy and the Information you previously submitted  will continue to be treated pursuant to the last version of the Privacy Policy  you agreed to unless you continue to use the Services/Site, which usage shall  constitute consent to the new practices. The amended Privacy Policy will be  notified on the Site and we will also notify you per email.</p>
<p><strong>Game  Events.</strong> For some  game related events, we may share information, including your profile and  nicknames, with third parties and either NEXON or the third party will post  relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for  the game related events. Should that privacy information, conflict with this  Privacy Policy, the privacy policy of that particular game event will govern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.  Your Choices</strong></p>
<p>You may at any time indicate that  you wish us to stop processing the information about you (if such information  is necessary for you to have an account, you will no longer be able to use the Services  and may no longer be able to use other aspects of the Service).</p>
<p>You may also at any time ”opt out”  of receiving materials described in this Privacy Policy from us and/or our commissioned  data processors. The materials that we send you (e.g., e-mails) will indicate  that such materials are from us and will always provide you with a method of “opting  out” of receiving future materials of a similar nature. If you do not ”opt out”  of receiving such materials, this will signify your continuing consent to NEXON  using your information to continue to provide you with such materials and  otherwise share the information about you with or transferring it to our commissioned  data processors who provide products or services (or advertisements, marketing  materials or other information) that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>If you decide that you would like  to ”opt-out” of receiving such materials from NEXON, please edit your account  information on our Site accordingly. If, at any time after you have provided us  with such information, you decide that you would like to “opt-out” of NEXON  providing it to its commissioned data processors, please contact our customer  service department by using the ticket submission form on the Site (at: <a href="http://www.nexoneu.com">http://www.nexoneu.com</a>). Keep in mind that, while NEXON  encourages its commissioned data processors, to adhere to our policies  regarding the privacy of our users and otherwise to handle the information  about you in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any  responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the  manner in which they use information received either from us or independently. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8.  Security of Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Although we do not represent that  we follow any particular, independent code of best practices, we maintain  reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your  information. For example, we protect some of your information by using a  firewall and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.</p>
<p>While we take reasonable  precautions against possible security threats, there is no such thing as ”perfect  security” on the Internet, so we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access,  hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We strongly recommend  that you take steps to maximize the security of your information, such as not  sharing your login information and logging out of your account after you are  done using our Service.</p>
<p>We store your information in the  EU/EEA as well as in other territories, more specifically in the territories of  the commissioned data processors mentioned in Section 6. You consent to such  storage and to the transfer of information from one territory to another, even  when these territories do not provide for the same adequate personal data  protection than the EU/EEA.</p>
<p>We will take reasonable steps to  require any third parties who you authorize us to share information about you  with to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.  Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may make  changes to this Privacy Policy. If we amend this Privacy Policy, we will notify  you and other users by posting and/or e-mail to the address which you have  provided while registering to the Services, a revised version of the Privacy  Policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will take effect after a reasonable  time span as set forth in the notice of such changes. We will provide the  notice by posting on the Site. Your continued use of the Site or Service after  such notice and an appropriate time span as set forth in the notice will be  deemed acceptance of such changes. We recommend that you return to the Site  periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of this  Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
