<h3>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
<br>
Nexopia.com is an online service where members create personal profiles that can be shared with other members of and (non-member) visitors to Nexopia.com. To allow our members to identify each other and expand their network of friends, members can display personal and other information to other members of and visitors to Nexopia.com.<br>
<br>
Your privacy is important to us.  To better protect your privacy, we provide this Privacy Policy to explain our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected, used and disclosed.  This Privacy Policy is accessible by a link at the bottom of every page on Nexopia.com and applies to all information collected through or submitted to the Nexopia website.<br>
<br>
We are particularly committed to protecting the privacy of minors.  For that reason, we will refuse to open an account for a person under the age of 14.  If you are under 14, please do not attempt to register for Nexopia.com or send any information about yourself to us. If we learn that information from a child under the age of 14 has bee submitted to us, we will delete that account and information as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
For persons between the ages of 14 and 18, we require parental or guardian consent prior to opening an account and we reserve the right to verify the existence of that consent.<br>
<br>
We will fully cooperate with any request to release information to any law enforcement agency when a proper request is received.  We may also take steps to protect the health and well being of members, visitors and other parties if we have reason to believe that any of these persons are in danger.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Collection, Use and Disclosure by Nexopia.com</h3>
<br>
When you register with and use Nexopia.com, you create your own profile and privacy settings and the information you submit/post, such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, etc. may be shared with other members and visitors in accordance with the privacy settings you select. Therefore, it is important that you understand what information is displayed to the public.  <b>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, any information included in your Profile or posted to blogs, forums and classifieds is accessible to the general public and not just registered members.</b>  We encourage you to view your Profile as others would view it by clicking on the Profile link in the top menu. All posting and sharing is done at your own risk.<br>
<br>
When opening an account, Nexopia.com collects information submitted by you, including but not limited to: name, email address, username (that you create), sex (gender), location and age.  In addition, to help members find and communicate with each other, you may submit and post additional profile data, including but not limited to the following: weight, height, sexuality (i.e. sexual orientation), dating and living situation and information regarding your interests through the "Profile" tab. In addition, you have the ability to post photographs.<br>
<br> 
You may change or remove any of your personal information at any time by logging into your account and clicking on the "Profile" and "Preferences" tabs in the top menu, except for your username, age, sex and location which are all publicly visible to all members and visitors (non-members). You may restrict your Profile from being viewed by visitors (non-members) and those users placed or your "ignore list". In addition, you may choose to hide your birth date, however, this information is still used to calculate your age.<br>
<br>
If you submit details in your Profile for MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) or ICQ, these are accessible by registered members on your friends list.<br>
<br>
Members communicate on Nexopia.com with each other through the Nexopia.com service, without revealing their email addresses.  To facilitate searching for and finding friends on the service, Nexopia.com allows members to search by age, gender, location, interests, sexuality and to limit searches only to members with pictures.<br>
<br> 
In addition, Nexopia.com allows searches by usernames and email addresses of members. The default will be that your username and email address are searchable, however, you may disable this option through your Preferences. If you allow your username and/or email address to be searchable, the user performing the search will be able to access your profile.<br>
<br>
Nexopia.com also encourages member interaction within the network community by displaying random member profile information, including members' pictures, usernames and age.<br>
<br>
We may use your external email address to respond to your inquiries or send updates or other news regarding the Nexopia service. We also use personal information of members included in a member's Profile to deliver advertising content that we believe may be of interest or use to a member.<br>
<br>
We will disclose information about payment and member Profile information to our third party credit card process provider for billing and payment purposes and where there is suspicious credit card use or a dispute concerning a charge.  We may also contact financial institutions directly to verify credit card information provided.  In doing so, we may share the information we received about the credit card and member.<br>
<br>
We sometimes receive calls from and/or attempt to call parents or guardians about a minor's use of a credit card belonging to someone other than the member.  Where a credit card belonging to a person other than the member has been submitted, we will first attempt to verify the identity of the caller as being the credit card holder and, if this is verified, we may release the name of the member who submitted the credit card information to us.  It is important that you have the full consent of the credit card holder before submitting their card number to us to pay for services.  We reserve the right to cancel your account at any time and prohibit your future use of the Nexopia.com site if you attempt to use a credit card without prior authorization.<br>
<br>
From time to time, Nexopia.com may hold a promotion, sweepstake or contest on Nexopia.com. Members may be asked to provide personal information such as name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. If you participate, Nexopia.com may collect and use personal information to administer the promotion, sweepstake or contest. What information is being collected and how it may be used or disclosed (and to whom) will be made evident at the time of collection through the relevant promotion, sweepstake or contest rules.<br>
<br> 
Nexopia.com also logs non-personally-identifiable information of members and visitors to the site, including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This information helps us manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. Aggregated information may be shared with third parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website or that Y number of men or Z number of women filled out our registration form.  Nexopia.com also records user IP addresses for the purposes of security and monitoring.<br>
<br>
