<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>
  NextSportStar (NSS) Privacy Policy</p><p>


This Privacy Policy describes NextSportStar’s (NSS's) policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. NSS receives your information through our various web sites, SMS, APIs, applications, services and third-parties ("Services"). For example, you send us information when you use NSS from our web site, post or receive comments via your smart phone. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by NSS in any country where NSS operates.<br><br>

Information Collection and Use<br><br>

Tip - We collect and use your information to provide and measure use of our Services and improve them over time.<br><br>

Information Collected Upon Registration: <br>
When you create or reconfigure a NSS account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.<br><br>

Additional Information: <br>
You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, or a picture. You may customize your account with information from your address book so that we can help you find NSS users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.<br><br>

Comments/Postings and  Public Information: <br>
Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you post, information you blog, discussions in our Forum, classifieds, your fans, the Stars you follow. For example, your public comments are searchable by many search engines. You should be careful about all information that will be made public by NSS, not just your Comments.<br><br>

Log Data: <br>
Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with our website, applications and advertisements, may also be included in Log Data. If we haven’t already deleted the Log Data earlier, we will either delete it or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.<br><br>

Links:  <br>
NSS  may keep track of how you interact with links in NSS across our Services including third party services and clients by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.<br><br>

Advertising:<br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Cookies: <br>
Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. NSS may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.<br><br>

We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.<br><br>
