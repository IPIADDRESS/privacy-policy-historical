To subscribe to the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your E-mail address. Optionally, we ask you to provide your first and last name. This information is only for the personalisation of the newsletter.</p>
<p><b>Newsletter Consent</b><br>
You will be asked to consent to the use of your personal data to receive our newsletter as follows:<br>
“You agree that the NEXT Conference will use the data and information provided by you in connection with the use of the newsletter to inform you periodically about NEXT promotions, tickets, conference news and publications. In addition, we may send you invitations to exclusive invite-only and further events by SinnerSchrader and Faktor 3 Live GmbH.<br>
We track and process your user behaviour on the NEXT Conference website after clicking on a link in the newsletter by means of a cookie. By clicking below, you agree that NEXT Conference may process your information in accordance with these terms.<br>
You can change your mind at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email you receive from us, or by contacting us at info@nextconf.eu. NEXT Conference will treat your information with respect and for more information about the privacy practices please visit the website. By entering your e-mail address and clicking the button below, you confirm that you are 16 years or older.”</p>
<p><b>Statistical survey and analysis</b><br>
The newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”. A pixel-sized file retrieved from the server of the shipping service provider when the newsletter is opened. Within the framework of this call, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of the call-up are collected. This information is used to technically improve the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior by means of their polling points (which can be determined using the IP address) or the access times. Statistical surveys also include determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and which links are clicked. This information can be assigned to individual newsletter recipients for technical reasons. It is, however, neither our endeavor, nor that of the shipping service provider, to observe individual users. The evaluations are much more useful for us to recognize the reading habits of our users and adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.</p>
<p><b>Cancellation / Revocation</b><br>
We may process your personal data until you revoke your consent. You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent. At the same time, your consent to sending it via MailChimp and the statistical analyzes expire. A separate revocation of the dispatch via MailChimp or the statistical evaluation is unfortunately not possible.<br>
A link to cancel the newsletter can be found at the end of each newsletter.<br>
For instructions to take this step, please refer to the confirmation e-mail and each newsletter.</p>

This means that the IP address of the users will be transferred by Google within Member States of the European Union or in other States Parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases the whole IP address will be first transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there.</p>

<p><strong>Data policy statement for Facebook fan pages</strong><br>
The use of this Facebook fan page is accompanied by the processing of personal data. In addition to Facebook, we as the fan page operator also collect and process users’ personal data on our fan page.</p>
<p>Our intention in providing the following information is to give you an overview of the processing mentioned above and also to advise you of your rights pursuant to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG – German Federal Data Protection Act).</p>
<p><strong>Data processing on our Facebook fan page</strong><br>
When you visit our fan page (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/nextconf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.facebook.com/nextconf</a>), Facebook Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, D2 Dublin, Ireland, collects, stores and processes your personal data in accordance with Facebook’s data policy.</p>
<p>Facebook uses cookies to store and further process this information, and these cookies are stored on the various devices of the visitors to the Facebook fan page, especially when the visitors are registered members of Facebook. As a result, Facebook can display targeted advertising on its own platform and also on third-party pages. Facebook does not publish in full and we do not know to what extent Facebook uses the above-mentioned data for its own purposes, to what extent activities on the Facebook fan page are associated with individual users, how long Facebook stores this data and whether data is disclosed to third parties.</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc., the US parent company of Facebook Ireland Ltd., is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield and has thus declared that it complies with the European level of data protection and the accompanying data policies. As the operator of the Facebook fan page, we cannot rule out the possibility that data belonging to users of the Facebook fan page will be transferred to and processed in third countries, nor can we exclude any related risks.</p>
<p>For further information, please also see Facebook’s data policy: <a href="https://facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://facebook.com/about/privacy/</a></p>
<p>Facebook furthermore offers the option of objecting to specific forms of data processing; you will find related information and opt-out choices at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a>.</p>
<p>We use the statistics services Facebook Insights for the purpose of designing and continually updating our pages as needed. This service records your activity on our page and sends it to us in the form of anonymised statistics. This allows us to gain an insight among other things into the activity of the visitors to our fan page, page views, the reach of contributions, views and average duration of video playbacks, information about which countries and cities our visitors come from as well as statistics on the gender balance of our visitors.</p>
<p>In addition, Facebook records data if you interact with our page as a registered Facebook user (e.g. if you click a Like button, send us a message, or post a comment). These interactions are also recorded and provided in the statistics by Facebook; we as the operator are unable to exert an influence on this. It is therefore not possible for us as the fan page operator to deactivate this function or to prevent data from being generated and processed.</p>
<p>It is not possible for us as the fan page operator to identify individual users or to access individual user profiles on the basis of the insights automatically provided by Facebook.</p>
<p>You can find more detailed information on Facebook Insights from Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook and we share responsibility for processing the Insights data. The details of this are governed by the agreement on shared responsibility (Joint Controller Addendum), which you can find <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As the fan page operator, we also process data to a very limited extent only. Our fan page is operated on the legal basis of a balance of interests in accordance with Art 6(1) f) GDPR.</p>
<p>In addition, we store user names and comments that are deleted on account of a breach of netiquette. These are tracked only in order to furnish any evidence that may be required in legal disputes within the period of limitation.</p>
<p>The legal basis for us as the operator of the Facebook fan page to process data as mentioned above is Art. 6(1) b) GDPR (e.g. if you send us a request relating to a contract) on the one hand. On the other, the data can also be processed on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 6(1) a) GDPR (e.g. if you “like” or comment on one of our posts or upload content onto our page). You can withdraw the consent you have given at any time with effect for the future by deleting the comment or the content in question. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent given before it is withdrawn.</p>
<p>Facebook has assumed the primary responsibility for the processing of personal data using the “Insights” service offered by Facebook. This concerns the processing of Insights data and the implementation of the rights of the data subject. Please therefore contact Facebook directly concerning all obligations arising from the GDPR in relation to the processing of Insights data. We will forward to Facebook any queries that we receive from you on this subject.</p>
