						<ul class="subsection-list">
							<li>
								<h3 class="sub-list-title">Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
								<p class="copy-text">We receive and store any information you enter on the Site.  The types of Personal Information collected includes e-mail address, name, phone number, billing information and shipping address.  We may ask for additional information such as age, gender, hobbies and interests. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. Of course, if you wish to engage in a purchase on the Site, you will have to provide us with the required information to fulfill the purchase. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new products.</p>
							</li>
							
							<li>
								<h3 class="sub-list-title">Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
								
								
								<ul class="sub-list">
									<li><p class="copy-text">We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Site.  Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, the name and identity of your computer, mobile device and other devices, your operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, connection speed, local information based on IP address, and, with your consent, as derived from GPS or similar features on your mobile device and other devices,.. </p></li>
								
									<li>
										<p class="copy-text">Generally, the Site automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of user visits to the Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.  Company may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure.  This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Site so that we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. We may also use information about your purchases and activities on the Site to present you with offers that we believe may be of interest. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our Participating Publishers and other third parties about how our users, collectively, use the Site.  We share this type of statistical data so that our Participating Publishers and other third parties also understand how often people use their services and the Site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. </p>
									</li>
								
								<li>
									<p class="copy-text">
									We will also use usage information in order to ensure users adhere to our Terms of Use. For example, a user’s usage information will help us confirm that a user only downloads a periodical or other content available for download to a maximum of 5 devices or 10 times in total (regardless of the number of devices).  </p>
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<p class="copy-text">
Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously.  While Company will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, and while you will not be able to engage in any transactions if we don’t know who you are, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, you may be able to opt out of Company’s marketing and promotional messaging by adjusting the settings in your account information.
