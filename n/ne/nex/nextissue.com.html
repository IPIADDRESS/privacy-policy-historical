<p>Next Issue Media LLC (“Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared. Please read the following Privacy Policy to learn more about our privacy practices. By visiting any of the websites operated by the Company and any sub-domains thereof, whether accessed online, via mobile, as an application, or any other format or method of distribution (collectively, the “Site”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other information about you and your computer or device that Company gathers when you are accessing the Site. Also, this Policy covers Company’s treatment of any Personal Information that Company acquires from the publishers whose publications are offered for sale on the Site (“Participating Publishers”). This Policy does not apply to information collected elsewhere, including without limitation offline and on sites, applications, destinations, or services linked to from the Site, or to the practices of third parties that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p>
<h3>What Personal Information Does Company Collect?</h3>
<p>The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users.</p>
<h4>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h4>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on the Site. The types of Personal Information collected includes e-mail address, name, phone number, billing information and shipping address. We may ask for additional information such as age, gender, hobbies and interests. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. Of course, if you wish to engage in a purchase on the Site, you will have to provide us with the required information to fulfill the purchase. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new products.</p>
<h4>Information Collected Automatically:</h4>
<ul>
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Site. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, the name and identity of your computer, mobile device and other devices, your operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, connection speed, local information based on IP address, and, with your consent, as derived from GPS or similar features on your mobile device and other devices,..</li>
<li>Generally, the Site automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of user visits to the Site and its components, which titles are accessed through the Site, and the length and time a user may spend reading those titles similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show and how long they watched. Company may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Site so that we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. We may also use information about your purchases and activities on the Site to present you with offers that we believe may be of interest. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our Participating Publishers and other third parties about how our users, collectively, use the Site. We share this type of statistical data so that our Participating Publishers and other third parties also understand how often people use their services and the Site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.</li>
<li>We will also use usage information in order to ensure users adhere to our Terms of Use. For example, a user’s usage information will help us confirm that a user only downloads a periodical or other content available for download to a maximum of 5 devices or 10 times in total (regardless of the number of devices).</li>
<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Company will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, and while you will not be able to engage in any transactions if we don’t know who you are, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</li>
</ul>
<h4>E-mail Communications:</h4>
<p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Company if your computer or device supports this type of program. We use this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, you may be able to opt out of Company’s marketing and promotional messaging by adjusting the settings in your account information. Until you terminate your account with us, you will not be able to opt-out of e-mails providing account related information such as billing, renewal or legal notices.</p>
<p>Personal Information From Other Sources:</p>
<p>For purposes such as improving personalization of our services, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.</p>
<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer or device to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in the site is visited and by how many people.</li>
<li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. You may wish to leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Site’s most attractive features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Will Company Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h3>
<p>Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We may share your Personal Information only with (a) entities that are controlled by or under common ownership or control with Company or (b) Participating Publishers that provide our content or (c) as described below.</p>
<p>Our Participating Publishers: We share Personal Information about you and data about your purchases and Site Usage with our Participating Publishers so that they may fulfill your purchase. Those Participating Publishers may also use such information to send directly to you offers for other publications and products that they think might be of interest to you, unless you have opted out of receiving such offers. Our Participating Publishers may also use your personal information and aggregated information to serve ads and offers to you while you are on the Site, and otherwise in accordance with their applicable privacy policies.</p>
<p>Merchants: In addition to our Participating Publishers, we work closely with a variety of other businesses that you can easily recognize by attribution within the landing page or within the content (“Merchants”). In certain situations, these Merchants may operate stores at the Site or sell publications or other products or services to you through the Site. In other situations, we provide services, or sell products jointly with, such Merchants. We will share user information that is related to your transactions with the applicable Merchants. For example, we may allow Merchants to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers, and we may provide information we have collected from you to a Merchant in non-personally-identifiable form, in order for that Merchant to select the appropriate audience for its advertisements and/or offers. We might also use your interest in a publication about fashion to show you ads for fashion related products and services from other Merchants, but we do not tell those Merchants who you are. Similarly, we may provide aggregate data we’ve collected about you to the Merchants that you may review on the Site so that those Merchants may provide you and their other users with an optimal experience, but we do not tell such Merchants who you are.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We retain other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages/sending postal mail/sending email/removing repetitive information from user lists/analyzing data/providing marketing assistance/processing credit card payments/and providing user service. Unless we tell you differently, Company’s service providers do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.</p>
<p>Promotional Offers: We may send offers to certain users on behalf of other businesses or allow third parties to offer promotions on the Site. Certain information you provide through the Site or related to such promotional offers, including Personal Information, will be shared in connection with the offer or transaction. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address unless you authorize us to do so (with the exception of information given to our Participating Publishers, as discussed above). If you do not wish to receive these offers, please adjust the settings in your account information.</p>
<p>Third Party Advertisers: We may, in the future, serve ads on the Site from third parties who are neither Participating Publishers nor Merchants. In that event, we may share certain Personal Information about Site users with such advertisers so that they can present you with offers that are relevant to you.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Company, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information may be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Company may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Protection of Company and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<h3>Is Personal Information About YOU Secure?</h3>
<p>We allow you to limit access to your account via a password. You need to ensure against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
<p>We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to encrypt your Personal Information during transmission for your privacy and security. However, because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, Company cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information in its possession or the security of its servers or databases. By using the Site you agree to assume all risk in connection with the Personal Information sent to or collected by Company when you use the Site. In the unlikely event that Company believes that the security of your Personal Information in its possession or control may have been compromised, Company may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, Company may notify you by e-mail, messaging to your device, or other means.</p>
<h3>What Personal Information Can YOU Access?</h3>
<p>Company allows you to access the following information about you for the purpose of viewing, and in certain situations, updating that information: e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, name, marketing preferences and the Participating Publishers’ account number(s) (in the case of print subscriptions). This list will change as the Site changes.</p>
<h3>What Choices Do YOU Have?</h3>
<ul>
<li>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information to use, even though it may be needed to make a purchase or take advantage of certain Company features.</li>
<li>You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the “What Personal Information Can I Access” section above. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.</li>
<li>Upon your written request to <a href="mailto:support@nextissue.com">support@nextissue.com</a>, we will remove your Personal Information from our active user database provided that (a) you are current with all payment obligations, (b) we do not believe it reasonably necessary to keep such information for any pending legal action, and (c) we are under no obligation to retain such information. Please be aware that any unfulfilled subscriptions may be canceled without refund and you will have to re-register in order to use the Site. It is your responsibility to request a refund from us or the appropriate merchant. Please note that, although we remove you from our active user database, some information may remain in our records after deletion of your account.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to receive marketing e-mails, you may opt-out by changing your preferences in your account settings. Please note that while you are an active user, you may not opt out of certain account related e-mails such as legal notices from us, or updates regarding this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Site, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</li>
<li>As explained earlier, the majority of browsers allow you to monitor and restrict our use of cookies. Please note, however, that if do not enable cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consent to Transfer</h3>
<p>Information you provide to Company will be collected and stored in the United States. By providing personal information to Company, you hereby consent to such collection and storage.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Company may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Site.</p>
<h3>Questions or Concerns</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy at the Site, please send us a detailed message to <a href="mailto:support@nextissue.com">support@nextissue.com</a>. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
