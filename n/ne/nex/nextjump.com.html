		<br>
		First name, last name, employer, number of employees, valid work email address and phone 							number are the only required pieces of information collected on www.nextjump.com and www.corporateperks.com.

		<br><br><span class="redHeader">How We Use This Personal Information</span>

		<br><br><span class="redHeader">What Information We Share</span>
		<br>Next Jump Inc. only shares aggregated data to third party vendors, but it will not disclose information specific to any user or company, including email address. This information represents a generic overview of our users' collective viewing habits and allows vendors to modify their discounts based on user traffic. Additionally, some participating corporations have requested monthly reports of traffic on the Perks program. These reports will reveal only the aggregated viewing habits of Perks visitors from that corporation. The reports will not disclose the user name, login ID or any other personal information of users, including email address.
		<br>When users give money to nonprofits through out Charitable Giving program, we will share personal information including email address, with chosen nonprofit only if permited.  Nonprofits use the contact information for acknowledgment purposes and to provide tax receipts.  We will not share this information unless you <strong>opt-in</strong> and thereby indicate to us not notify the nonprofit of your gift.  If you wish to discontinue receiving information from the respective nonprofit, please contact them directly.
		<br>When users RSVP to an in-store retail event, limited information is provided to the participating merchant in the form of the guest list for admittance into the private event.  This information is limited to your first name and last name, and if you will be bringing a guest.
		<br><br><span class="redHeader">Cookies</span>
		<br>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  Next Jump Inc. uses cookies on the site(s).  Next Jump Inc. does link the information stored in cookies persoanlly identifiable infomation, including email address, you submit while on the site(s).		
		<br><br>Next Jump Inc. uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  Session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate the site(s).  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. 
		<br>
		<br>Persistent cookies are set to store an encrypted link to your account information, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies also enable Next Jump Inc. to track and target the interests of users to enhance the experience on the site(s).  If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. 
		<br><br>Some business partners (e.g., advertisers, tracking utilities) use cookies on the site(s). Next Jump Inc. has no access to or control over these cookies.
		<br><br>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.nextjump.com and www.corporateperks.com and private label subdomains delivered by Next Jump Inc. only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
		<br><br><span class="redHeader">Emails</span>
		<br>Next Jump Inc. will not send unsolicited emails to registered users of Perks without consent.  Additionally, users may choose to receive Perks correspondence, including email reminders of specific vendor offers and Perks newsletters. The "my account" channel on the site displays the correspondence you've elected to receive, and provides the option to unsubscribe from future Perks related emails.
		<br>
		<br><span class="redHeader">Opting Out</span>
		<br>All emails sent by Perks contain directions on how to unsubscribe from future correspondence. At any time, users may opt out of Perks related correspondence by sending an email to CorporatePerks@nextjump.com. Users may also access their personal information, including email address to make edits in the “My Account” section of the website.
		<br>
		<br>In addition, a registered user who wishes that their personal information, including email address to be completely removed from the Perks database should email CorporatePerks@nextjump.com.  We will respond to your request within twenty [20] business days.  An employee's complete removal of his or her personal information from the database negates that employee's ability to login to Perks
		<br><br><span class="redHeader">Notification Of Changes To Privacy Policy</span>
		<br>Users will be notified of changes or revisions to this privacy policy, including our email practives, by a notice posted on the Perks login page. The notice will contain a link, whereby the Privacy policy can be examined in full. In this way registered users are made aware of policy changes prior to shopping or browsing the Web Site.  As always, a user who is not amenable to the conditions of a revised privacy policy may opt out of Perks by means outlined earlier in this document.
		<br><br><span class="redHeader">Purchasing Items Directly Through the Perks Site</span>
		<br><br><span class="copyLink">Agents</span>
		<br>Next Jump Inc. uses an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain share, store or use personally identifiable information, including email address, for any other purposes.
		<br><br><span class="copyLink">Service Providers</span>
		<br>Next Jump Inc. uses other third parties to process credit card transactions on the site(s).  When you sign up for programs directly related to Perks, Next Jump Inc. will share first name, last name, credit card information and billing address as necessary for the third party to provide that service. No other information is shared with their parties for this purpose.
		<br><br>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information, including email address, for any other purpose.
		<br><br>Perks is a portal that provides access to exclusive discounts redeemable at the point of purchase at a certain vendor's online or offline location. In rare cases, Perks may serve as both vendor and portal, and will collect certain information necessary to complete an online purchase. Like every online purchase, you will be required to submit the following information to buy an item where Perks is the vendor:
		<br><br>
		  • Shipping or billing address or both<br>
		  • Credit card information<br>
		  • Day time phone number<br>
		  • Email address
		<br><br>In all cases, any transaction conducted through Perks is secured and encrypted with SSL technology, and certified by Verisign. Hence, you may submit any sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) to this site with the assurance that it will remain protected.
		<br><br>All email addresses are safeguarded through database encryption in both sitting and transmitting states. At no point are email address disclosed or shared for purposes not outlined in this statement.
		<br><br>Again, Perks will never compromise your personal privacy. Information, including email address, submitted to carry out a transaction where Next Jump Inc. is the vendor is kept in the highest confidentiality, and is absolutely never shared with outside parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
		<br><br><span class="redHeader">Vendor's Privacy</span>
		<br>Perks is a portal that enables users to purchase discounted products on the Web Sites of participating vendors. Each vendor maintains its' own privacy policy that you should be familiar with before you submit your personal information. Our privacy policy is not applicable on any of the vendor sites. Therefore, it is important for a potential buyer to familiarize himself with the privacy policies of each vendor.
		<br><br>Next Jump, Inc will never transmit personal identifiers, including name, email address, or user ids to any participating vendor. Clicking on a vendor site through Perks does not result in the transmission of your personal information to that vendor.
		<br><br><span class="redHeader">Limits</span>
		<br>Although your privacy is of paramount concern to us, Next Jump Inc. cannot reasonably be expected to suppress information where the withholding of such information represents a violation of federal or state law. 
		<br><br>Next Jump Inc. reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information, icluding email address, as required by law and when it is believed that disclosure is necessary to protect Next Jump Inc.’s rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on the site(s).
		<br><br><span class="redHeader">Your Consent</span>
		<br>As a user of Perks, you consent to our collection and storage of your personal information, including email address, (as defined above) in our database, and to our use of aggregated and non-personal information generated by the viewing habits of our users.
		<br><br><span class="redHeader">In Summary:</span>
		<br>Next Jump Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy. Next Jump Inc. does not sell, trade, give away, or rent personal or company information, including email address, to any outside parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
