			Your Privacy<br>

			<br>
			<span class="whitesm">
			At Next Jump, we are committed to protecting your privacy. Personal information -- including your E-mail address -- is collected only for registering to win, playing games, or purchasing something. We will NOT sell our email list to another company.

			What information do we collect? How do we use it?<br>
			</span>
			<br>
			<span class="whitesm">
			When you order something, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.
			<br>
			<br>
			When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new Next Jump, Inc. services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. We occasionally have events planned such as giveaways, free prizes, contests, etc.

			The material that appears on Next Jump is for informational purposes only. Despite our efforts to provide useful and accurate information, errors may appear from time to time. Before you act on information you've found on our site, you should confirm any facts that are important to your decision.

			Next Jump wants to encourage an open exchange of information and ideas. But we cannot and do not review every posting made in public posting areas. You may well read any given posting before anyone on the Next Jump staff does. Take what you find with a grain of salt. You can expect these areas to include information and opinions from a variety of individuals and organizations other than Next Jump. We do not endorse or guarantee the accuracy of any posting, regardless of whether the posting comes from a user or from a celebrity or "expert" guest. There is no substitute for healthy skepticism and your own good judgment.
			<br>
			<br>
			Responsibility for what is posted in the chat rooms, forums, and other public posting areas on Next Jump lies with each user: you alone are responsible for material you post. By using Next Jump you agree NOT to post or transmit any defamatory, abusive, obscene, threatening or illegal material, or any other material that infringes on the ability of others to enjoy NextJump.com or that infringes on the rights of others. We retain the right to deny access to anyone who we believe has violated these terms or any other term of this agreement.
