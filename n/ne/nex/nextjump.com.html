    <div class="privHeader">Your Privacy</div>
    <p>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. At no time will we trade, sell, or distribute
        for free company specific or personal information, including email addresses or other user
        <abbr title="Identifications">IDs</abbr>, to any individual, company, vendor or organization, in ways other than disclosed in this
        privacy statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please <a href="mailto:info@nextjump.com">contact us</a>
        If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact the Better Business Bureau <a href="http://www.BBB.org" target="_blank">http://www.BBB.org</a>. 
        The Better Business Bureau will then serve as a liaison with us
        to resolve your concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> complies with the <acronym title="European Union">EU</acronym> Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce
        regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.
    </p>

    <div class="privHeader">The Personal Information We Collect</div>
    <div class="privSubHeader">On Perks Sites</div>
    <p>
        Your first name, last name, valid work email address, and work zip code represent the only pieces of
        personal information you must submit to access the program. In certain instances, other demographic
        data will be collected, but not required. Perks uses this information to provide the benefits/services
        associated with the program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, Perks collects click-stream data and other preference information on its users in order
        to improve the design and vendor selection of the site. Click-stream data represents a page-by-page
        history of a person's site usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perks is a portal through which users access discounts redeemable at selected vendors. In most cases,
        online purchases facilitated by the program portal are subject to the privacy policies of the Web
        Site where that transaction is conducted. In a few cases; however, Perks itself functions as the vendor
        and must collect additional personal information, described later in this Privacy Policy, to complete the
        online transaction.
    </p>

    <div class="privSubHeader">On Corporate Sites</div>
    <p>
        First name, last name, employer, number of employees, valid work email address and phone number are the
        only required pieces of information collected on www.nextjump.com and www.corporateperks.com. This is done
        on a voluntary basis and ensures that Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> can properly respond to all inquiries submitted
        through the site.
    </p>

    <div class="privHeader">Invite a Spouse/Family Member</div>
    <p>
        If you choose to use our referral service to tell a spouse/family member about our site, we will ask you
        for your spouse/family member’s name and email address. We will automatically send your spouse/family
        member a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> stores this information for
        the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your
        spouse/family member may  to request that we remove this information from our database.
    </p>

    <div class="privHeader">How We Use This Personal Information</div>
    <div class="privSubHeader">On Perks Sites</div>
    <p>
        Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> requires your first name, last name, email address, and work zip code for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ol class="privList">
      <li>
        To provide a point of contact for communicating Perks correspondence, including your personal
        password, technical issues that may arise and periodic reminders that you may request (on an opt-in
        basis) as a Perks user.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assign a name to your user id and password.
      </li>
      <li>
        To verify your employment with the organization using Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> Perks program.
      </li>
      <li>
        To provide the benefits/services associated with Perks.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Click-stream data can help determine the popularity of vendors, offers and site features with our
        audience, allowing us to develop a better site. An individual user's click-stream data is kept in the
        strictest confidence, and will never be distributed to any party outside of Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr>
    </p>

    <div class="privSubHeader">On Corporate Sites</div>
    <p>
        Information submitted through www.nextjump.com and www.corporateperks.com is done so on a voluntary
        basis by individuals seeking to learn more about Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> Personal information is gathered to
        ensure a prompt and accurate reply by a Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> representative.
    </p>

    <div class="privSubSubHeader">What Information We Share</div>
    <p>
        Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> only shares aggregated data to third party vendors, but it will not disclose information
        specific to any user or company, including email address. This information represents a generic overview
        of our users' collective viewing habits and allows vendors to modify their discounts based on user
        traffic. Additionally, some participating corporations have requested monthly reports of traffic on the
        Perks program. These reports will reveal only the aggregated viewing habits of Perks visitors from that
        corporation. The reports will not disclose the user name, login ID or any other personal information of
        users, including email address.
    </p>
    <p>
        When users give money to nonprofits through our Charitable Giving program, we will share personal
        information including email address, with the chosen nonprofit only if permitted. Nonprofits use the contact
        information for acknowledgment purposes and to provide tax receipts. We will not share this information
        unless you opt-in and thereby indicate to us to notify the nonprofit of your
        gift. If you wish to discontinue receiving information from the respective nonprofit, please contact them
        directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        When users <abbr title="Reply, please">RSVP</abbr> to an in-store retail event, limited information is provided to the participating merchant
        in the form of the guest list for admittance into the private event. This information is limited to your
        first name and last name, and if you will be bringing a guest.
    </p>

    <div class="privSubSubHeader">Cookies</div>
    <p>
        A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. Next
        Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> uses cookies on the site(s). Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> does link the information stored in cookies personally
        identifiable information, including email address, you submit while on the site(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are used to make it
        easier for you to navigate the site(s). A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent
        cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by
        following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
    </p>
    <p>
        Persistent cookies are set to store an encrypted link to your account information, so you don’t have
        to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> to track and target the interests
        of users to enhance the experience on the site(s). If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but
        your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some business partners (<abbr title="for the sake of example">e.g.</abbr>, advertisers, tracking utilities) use cookies on the site(s). Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr>
        has no access to or control over these cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
        This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.nextjump.com and www.corporateperks.com and private
        label subdomains delivered by Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
    </p>

    <div class="privSubSubHeader">Emails</div>
    <p>
        Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> will not send unsolicited emails to registered users of Perks without consent. Additionally,
        users may choose to receive Perks correspondence, including email reminders of specific vendor offers and
        Perks newsletters. The "my account" channel on the site displays the correspondence you've elected
        to receive, and provides the option to unsubscribe from future Perks related emails.
    </p>

    <div class="privSubSubHeader">Opting-Out</div>
    <p>
        All emails sent by Perks contain directions on how to unsubscribe from future correspondence. At any time,
        users may opt-out of Perks related correspondence by reaching us on our <a href="mailto:info@nextjump.com">contact us</a>.
        Users may also access their personal information, including email address to make edits in the
        “My Account” section of the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, a registered user who wishes that their personal information, including email address to be
        completely removed from the Perks database should <a href="mailto:info@nextjump.com">contact us</a>
        We will respond to your request within twenty [20] business days. An employee's complete removal of his or her personal
        information from the database negates that employee's ability to login to Perks.
    </p>

    <div class="privSubSubHeader">Notification Of Changes To Privacy Policy</div>
    <p>
        Users will be notified of changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy, including our email practices, by
        a notice posted on the Perks login page. The notice will contain a link, whereby the Privacy Policy can be
        examined in full. In this way registered users are made aware of policy changes prior to shopping or browsing
        the Web Site. As always, a user who is not amenable to the conditions of a revised Privacy Policy may opt-out
        of Perks by means outlined earlier in this document.
    </p>

    <div class="privHeader">Purchasing Items Directly Through the Perks Site</div>
    <div class="privSubHeader">Agents</div>
    <p>
        Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> uses an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to
        bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable
        information, including email address, for any other purposes.
    </p>
    <div class="privSubHeader">Service Providers</div>
    <p>
        Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> uses other third parties to process credit card transactions on the site(s). When you sign
        up for programs directly related to Perks, Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> will share first name, last name, credit card
        information and billing address as necessary for the third party to provide that service. No other information
        is shared with their parties for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information, including email
        address, for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perks is a portal that provides access to exclusive discounts redeemable at the point of purchase at a
        certain vendor's online or offline location. In rare cases, Perks may serve as both vendor and portal, and
        will collect certain information necessary to complete an online purchase. Like every online purchase, you
        will be required to submit the following information to buy an item where Perks is the vendor:
    </p>
    <ul class="privList">
        <li>Shipping or billing address or both</li>
        <li>Credit card information</li>
        <li>Daytime phone number</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In all cases, any transaction conducted through Perks is secured and encrypted with <acronym title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</acronym> technology, and
        certified by Verisign. Hence, you may submit any sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) to this site
        with the assurance that it will remain protected.
    </p>
    <p>
        At no point are email address disclosed or shared for purposes not outlined in this statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, Perks will never compromise your personal privacy. Information, including email address, submitted
        to carry out a transaction where Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> is the vendor is kept in the highest confidentiality, and
        is absolutely never shared with outside parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
    </p>

    <div class="privHeader">Vendor's Privacy</div>
    <p>
        Perks is a portal that enables users to purchase discounted products on the Web Sites of participating
        vendors. Each vendor maintains its own Privacy Policy that you should be familiar with before you submit
        your personal information. Our Privacy Policy is not applicable on any of the vendor sites. Therefore, it
        is important for a potential buyer to familiarize himself with the privacy policies of each vendor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next Jump, <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> will never transmit personal identifiers, including name, email address, or user <abbr title="Identifications">IDs</abbr> to any
        participating vendor. Clicking on a vendor site through Perks does not result in the transmission of your
        personal information to that vendor.
    </p>

    <div class="privHeader">Limits</div>
    <p>
        Although your privacy is of paramount concern to us, Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> cannot reasonably be expected to
        suppress information where the withholding of such information represents a violation of federal or state law.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information, icluding email address,
        as required by law and when it is believed that disclosure is necessary to protect Next Jump <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr>’s
        rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on the site(s).
    </p>
    <div class="privHeader">Your Consent</div>
    <p>
        As a user of Perks, you consent to our collection and storage of your personal information, including email
        address, (as defined above) in our database, and to our use of aggregated and non-personal information
        generated by the viewing habits of our users.
    </p>
