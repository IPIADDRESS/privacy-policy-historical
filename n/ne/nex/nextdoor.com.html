<b><a name="2">Information collected and used by Nextdoor</a></b></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

Nextdoor collects and uses information in the following ways:</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

<u>Registration and Request for Service</u></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

Registration is required in order to request or sell a service using the Nextdoor website or a co-branded version of the Nextdoor website. Service providers and persons who request services (collectively, "Users") must provide contact information when registering. At a minimum, service providers must provide their name, phone number, address,  email address, a user name, a password, type of legal entity (e.g., company, individual, partnership, etc.), service area, method by which the service provider wants to receive leads, category of service provided and, as described below under Payment, credit card information. Persons requesting services must provide their name, email address, user name, password and service requirements (such as the type of service requested and the place of performance of the service). </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

As part of the registration process, service providers may create a service provider profile. The service provider profile will be pre-populated with the information provided during the registration process. In addition, the service provider may also, if it wishes, provide additional information in the profile, such as biographical information about the seller, accomplishments of the service provider, certifications of the service provider, awards received by the service provider and references. A person requesting services may view the service provider profiles of service providers who respond to any service request submitted by such requestor. Users also have the ability to view the service provider profile of any registered service provider by looking up the service provider's name. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

In general, the above-described information is used by Nextdoor to match service providers and persons requesting services and to provide a more personalized experience to Users. A User's contact information may also be used to contact the User under certain limited circumstances such as unusual account activity or for customer service purposes.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

More particularly, when a person requesting a service submits a service request, the requestor's user name and information concerning the service request are forwarded to service providers who match the request (by category of service and zip code). The service provider can then respond to the request and if it does so, the service provider's response information, name and email address are forwarded to the requestor (the requestor will also be able to review the service provider's profile). If the requestor chooses to accept a response, he/she can contact the service provider in the manner he/she sees fit. Registration and service request information is stored on servers under our control and used to pre-populate service request forms on future visits to the Nextdoor website.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

<u>Payment</u></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

Service providers who register online must also provide their credit card information and billing address so that Nextdoor can charge them subscription fees for the Nextdoor service (the amount of the subscription fees are detailed on the Nextdoor website). Nextdoor or a third party billing entity with whom Nextdoor contracts will use such information to charge the selected subscription fee (annual or monthly) to the service provider.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

<u>Member Review of Registered Service Providers and Persons Requesting Services</u></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

Nextdoor encourages Users to submit reviews rating their experience with registered service providers and persons requesting services. Users are asked to rate their experience with the registered service provider or service requestor, as well as enter a comment on their experience.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

Review information is freely available to all Users as follows:
Responses are aggregated and reviewers' specific comments are also available for viewing (the user name of the person providing the comment is disclosed). The User who is the subject of the review is also given the opportunity to respond to the comment and any such response is also disclosed as part of the rating information.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

All uses of the Nextdoor website (including the member review portion of the website) is subject to Nextdoor's Terms of Use.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

<u>Feedback</u></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

Users may provide feedback (e.g., input and suggestions) to Nextdoor regarding the Nextdoor website. Users providing feedback must provide their name and email address. Any contact information entered when providing feedback will only be used to acknowledge or respond to that feedback and will also be retained by Nextdoor for record keeping purposes.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

If a User sends us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we will collect such information into a file for recordkeeping purposes.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

<u>Usage Tracking</u></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

Nextdoor automatically tracks certain information from its Users. This information includes the URL that the User just came from, what browser the User is using, and the User's IP address. Many websites automatically collect this information.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

We gather and use Users' IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our service and to help enhance your visit to this website.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

<u>Cookies</u></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

Nextdoor uses cookies on certain pages of its service (cookies are small files that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive). Cookies can help us personalize our website and provide information which is targeted to the individual user's interests. The User is always free to decline our cookies if his or her browser permits, although in that case our service would be largely unusable. Among other things, the User would be unable to submit service requests, to rate registered service providers and service requestors and to create a service provider profile.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

<b><a name="3">How does Nextdoor use the information it collects?</a></b></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

<u>Delivery of Content</u></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

Subject to the "Choice/Opt-out" section below, Nextdoor (and if you registered on a co-branded site, Nextdoor's co-brand associate) may use your registration and usage information to deliver content to you that Nextdoor (or its co-brand associate) thinks might interest you. This content will most often be delivered to you via email by Nextdoor (or its co-brand associate) or by one of Nextdoor's (or its co-brand associate's) authorized agents.</font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

Subject to the "choice/opt-out" section below, Nextdoor (and if you registered on a co-branded site, Nextdoor's co-brand associate) may also use your registration and usage information to communicate with you from time to time about changes and improvements to the Nextdoor or co-branded website or the Nextdoor or co-branded service, about sweepstakes or promotions conducted by Nextdoor or its co-branded associate, and about Nextdoor's <a href="terms_use.jsp">Terms of Use</a> and this Privacy Policy.</font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

Subject to the "choice/opt-out" section below, Nextdoor (and if you registered on a co-branded site, Nextdoor's co-brand associate) may permit its advertising and promotional associates to call to your attention products, special offers and unique content Nextdoor (or its co-brand associate) believes might be of interest to you. Nextdoor (and its co-brand associate) may also use this information to communicate with you or allow third parties to communicate with you about services and products offered by Nextdoor's (or its co-brand associate's) affiliates, advertisers and partners, and about other matters.</font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

Nextdoor (and if you registered on a co-branded site, Nextdoor's co-brand associate) may also provide aggregate statistics about its Users, sales, traffic patterns, and related information to selected third parties.</font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

<u>Co-Branded Sites and our Co-Branded Associates' Use of Information collected from such Sites</u></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

Nextdoor has entered into co-branding relationships with third parties and has developed co-branded versions of the Nextdoor site with third parties. If you have entered the Nextdoor network through such a co-branded site, the information that we collect will be subject to the terms of this privacy policy when used by Nextdoor, and the privacy policy of our co-branded associate when used by our associate.</font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

Pursuant to our agreements with our co-brand associates, we have agreed to provide substantially all information collected from users of the co-branded site to the relevant co-branded associate. Our co-branded associate's use of such information will be governed by the terms of its own privacy policy. Therefore, if you entered the Nextdoor network through a co-branded site, you should review the privacy policy of our co-branded associate in addition to this Privacy Policy to determine how information that you disclose will be used.</font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

<u>Disclaimers</u></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

Unfortunately, for reasons beyond our control, we cannot ensure that all of a User's private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, although we believe we use industry standard practices to protect our Users' privacy, we do not promise that their personally identifiable information or private communications will never be disclosed.</font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from Users. To the extent that Users disclose information to other parties, whether they are buyers or service providers on our system or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of such information. You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address or other messages) on comment screens, in message boards or chat areas, or in any other manner that is intended for display on the Nextdoor website or access by other buyers and service providers, that information is available to other Users reading such postings, and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond Nextdoor's control.</font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

Finally, through the Nextdoor website, you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information or websites offered by other parties.  Nextdoor expects its associates and affiliates to respect the privacy of Nextdoor's Users.  However, such third parties may adhere to their own privacy customs and policies, and disregard ours. Since Nextdoor does not control the privacy policies of third parties, Users may be subject to the privacy customs and policies of those third parties. We encourage Users to ask questions before disclosing their personal information to others.</font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

In addition, emails that we send to our Users will provide such Users with the ability to opt-out of receiving future emails from Nextdoor.

<b><a name="8">What about security?</a></b></font></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

Nextdoor is very much aware of Internet users' concerns about the privacy of their information. Nextdoor takes several security precautions to protect User information. User information is stored on servers protected by firewall, system-level and database-level security.</font></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

There are concerns about giving out credit card information online and we take the security of user transactions very seriously. We use the latest Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect your credit card information. The SSL technology is the industry standard for transferring sensitive information over the internet. Only those employees of Nextdoor who require access to data concerning Users are granted access to the data (e.g., marketing product managers, system administrators, customer service representatives and engineering personnel). Access to User data by employees is further limited by being only available through a dedicated administrative interface and through use of a restricted userID and password and, in the case of credit card information, is encrypted in Nextdoor's database using a leading encryption technology. In addition, every employee of Nextdoor is required to sign Nextdoor's standard Nondisclosure and Developments Agreement that requires employees to keep User data confidential. The Company's internal web security policies are reviewed and revised on a regular basis.</font></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">

If Nextdoor changes this Privacy Policy to alter the way in which it can use your personally identifiable information Nextdoor will notify you via email.

In addition, if Nextdoor makes any material changes to this Privacy Policy that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site for a 30 business day period notifying users of the change. In some cases where Nextdoor posts the notice it may also email users, who have opted to receive communications from Nextdoor, notifying them of the changes in Nextdoor's privacy practices.</font></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2">
