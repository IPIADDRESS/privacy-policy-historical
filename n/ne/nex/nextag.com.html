<p></p><div class="dr"><b>IP Addresses</b></div><p></p>

<p>Your IP address is also used at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our Site. We may provide third parties with statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related Site information.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Zip Code:</b> In order to use the total price functionality on our site, (i.e. finding out total price including the cost of shipping and sales tax) we ask you for your zip code.
</p><p><b>Email Address:</b> If you wish to register for either Price Alerts (through our Watch List feature) or our Buyer's Alert Newsletter, we require that you provide us with your email address.
</p><p><b>Basic Contact Info:</b> When a visitor decides to become a registered user, we ask for some basic contact information (i.e. username, zip code and email address). We use this basic contact information to facilitate the use of certain features of our Site (e.g. total price and submission of seller reviews) and to send the user information about our company. We also use email addresses to communicate occasional offers from our partners and advertisers.
</p><p><b>Complete Contact Info:</b> When a user wishes to get contacted by a merchant (e.g. auto dealer in their local area) or when a registered user decides to become a seller, we collect complete contact information, i.e. full name, address and phone number as well as credit card number and expiration date. This information is used by NexTag to either forward personal information on to appropriate merchants or to validate the user's identity and to bill the user for services provided by NexTag. All credit card information is encrypted and, with the exception of our credit card processing service, is not shared with any third party at any time without your approval. The credit card processing company may retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for their internal purposes.

</p><p>Use of Personal Information
</p><ul>
	<li>To forward to merchants that offer the products or service a user is interested in</li>
	<li>To contact a user in response to a customer service question from the user or to resolve a dispute between users.</li>
	<li>To process credit card payments approved in advance by a user.</li>
	<li>To allow a user to send an email to another user who is listing an item for sale on our site.</li>
	<li>To share information about the Site if the user opts in to receive such communications.</li>
	<li>To distribute occasional promotional material from our partners and advertisers if the user opts in to receive such communications.</li>
	<li>To assist law enforcement or other governmental agencies investigating cases of possible illegal activities by third parties.</li>
</ul>

Please note that opting out will prevent you from receiving email from NexTag regarding updates and improvements to the Site or offers and promotions we may be offering.</p>

<p>In some cases we request that you submit personal information in order to forward this information to our partners that have products or services you have indicated that you are interested.  In the event you agree to submit such information and authorize us to share this information with our partners (e.g. car dealers), we no longer have control over the use of such information and your rights regarding such use will be governed by the policies of our partners.</p>

<p></p><div class="dr"><b>Accessing and Changing your Personal Information</b></div><p></p>

<p></p><div class="heading2">Mortgage Users</div><p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section of the Privacy Policy applies specifically to Mortgage Users and the collection and use of information from Mortgage Users.</p>

<p></p><div class="dr"><b>Information Collection and Sharing</b>

<p>NexTag requests that Mortgage Users provide us with Mortgage User information on a questionnaire, which includes personal financial and contact information ("Mortgage User Information"). We request Mortgage User Information so as to enable NexTag to provide Mortgage Users with mortgage related services.   We only disclose Mortgage User Information in compliance with applicable laws.  In the questionnaire, we obtain authorization from a Mortgage User to disclose Mortgage User Information to participating banks, mortgage brokers, loan brokers, financial institutions, and in some cases aggregators (collectively, "Lenders") in the questionnaire and state that we cannot provide our mortgage-related services without such authorization.   In the event a Mortgage User has provided its authorization to share Mortgage User Information with Lenders, NexTag does not have control over the use of such Mortgage User Information by the Lenders and the Mortgage User's rights regarding such use will be governed by the policies of the Lenders with whom the information is shared.   After the Mortgage User has left our Site, we continue to treat Mortgage User Information as confidential and do not disclose it to third parties other than as authorized by the Mortgage User. We do not provide a means of updating Mortgage User Information. Any such updates should be provided directly to the Lenders that contact the Mortgage User.</p>

<p></p><div class="dr"><b>Confidentiality and Security</b>

<p>We restrict access to Mortgage User Information to those NexTag employees and agents who need to know that information to provide better enable us to provide mortgage-related and other services to Mortgage Users.</p>

<p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your Mortgage User Information.</p>
