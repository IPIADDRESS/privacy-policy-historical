This Website Privacy Statement is effective as of the date listed above. Even if you read and/or agreed to a prior privacy statement, you need to review this updated version. We reserve the right to revise this Website Privacy Statement at any time and at our discretion, as described in this paragraph. If we decide to change our Website Privacy Statement, we will post those changes to this Website Privacy Statement accessible on the homepages of the Websites, and other places we deem appropriate. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via either email or by posting a notice on the Websites for 30 days, prior to such use taking effect.</p> <p>PEOPLE UNDER 18 YEARS OLD </p> <p>Our Websites are not intended for use by people under eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under 18, please do not send any information to us. By accessing Websites or using our services, you represent that you are 18 years of age or older.</p> <li><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE </strong><br> This section describes the information that we collect about you and how it is used.</li> <p><strong>2.1 Information Submitted by You:</strong> You are not required to provide information about yourself when you visit our Websites but you may elect to do so, such as to take advantage of certain services or features. Examples of situations where you may submit information include: </p> <ul> <li><p><u>Account or Profile Information:</u> On some of the Websites, you may become a registered user or register for email notices from us. If you do, we ask for some basic contact information, such as a username, ZIP Code and email address. In some cases, as described below, you may enter additional account information. You also may choose to provide other information, either as part of your public profile or otherwise, such as your age, gender or interests.</p></li> <li><p><u>Order Processing Information:</u> We may allow checkout or payment processing features on the Websites to facilitate your purchase of products from merchants. The checkout or payment processing services are provided by a third party service provider, and all sales are made by the merchant. The service provider will collect information that is needed to process the order, such as credit card and related information like your billing address, as well as information that is needed for your order, such as your shipping address and the products that you purchased. This information is transmitted by the service provider to the merchant to complete your order. This information may be collected and stored by the third party service provider and/or the merchant in order to complete these functions. The service provider also may provide us with your contact information (such as name and email address) as well as product purchase information. Our privacy policy will apply to information that we collect or receive, the service provider's privacy policy will apply to information that it collects or receives and the merchant's privacy policy will apply to information that we, our service provider, or you provide to the merchant.</p></li> <li><p><u>Customer Service:</u> You may elect to provide us with information about your purchases, such as customer service requests or information about merchant issues.</p></li> <li><p><u>Content or Correspondence Submitted By You:</u> If you choose to post content on any of the Websites (for example, a product or merchant review, wish list, or comment or discussion forums), or submit personal correspondence to Nextag, we may collect and maintain that information in a file specific to you. Our Websites may also allow you to interact and share personal information and data with others. For example, some of the Websites allow you to create lists of products that are interesting to you. The default for certain lists is for the list to be publicly available. You may change the privacy setting of your lists as provided on the Websites. Additionally, some of the Websites may allow you to share information on social networks, as described in the section "Social Networks".</p></li> <li><p><u>Social Networks:</u> Some of the Websites allow you to register or login to an account you already have with a social networking account, such as Facebook. If you decide to login via a social networking account, we receive information about you from the social networking account, which can include your name, profile picture, email address, gender, user ID, and comments made on the social networking account site. Logging in to our Websites via a social networking account is always optional, but may allow you to publish your activity or interactions with our Websites to your social network account, such as Facebook or Twitter. The information we collect, and the social network's use of any information that you publish to it, may depend on the privacy settings you have with the social networking account or the social network's privacy policy, so be sure to consult your social networking account's privacy settings, and the social networking account's privacy policy and terms of use.</p></li> <li><p><u>Social Media Widgets:</u> Our Website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons and Widgets. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p></li> <li><p><u>Blog:</u> Our Website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:legalnotices@wizecommerce.com"> legalnotices@nextag.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p></li> <li><p><u>Survey / Contest:</u> We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to improve our site, notify you if you won a contest or to send you an email newsletter or other marketing materials. We use SurveyMonkey a third party service provider to conduct these surveys; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p></li> <li><p><u>Links to Third Parties:</u> Our Site includes links to other Websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Nextag. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Website you visit.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2.2 Automatically Collected Information:</strong> Examples of information that may be automatically collected include: </p> <ul> <li><p><u>Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technology:</u> A cookie is a small file stored on a computer's hard drive or mobile device. We use both "session" cookies, which terminate when a user closes his browser, and "persistent" cookies, which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted. We use cookies, for example, to save information on your username, ZIP Code and Website preferences, and to collect anonymous information about your use of our Websites and services (including your browsing history, the terms you searched, the products you viewed, your activity on the pages you view, etc.) and your interaction with our advertisements that are served on the Websites or other sites. You may decline our cookies if your web browser software permits, although this may prevent you from accessing certain features on our Websites. We also may use web beacons (also called clear gifs), which are simple pieces of code that allow us to place small images on web pages or emails, or other standard technology that are similar in function to cookies. We also utilize web beacons that are embedded in our HTML emails to track interactions with our emails, such as how many emails recipients have opened.</p></li> <li><p><u>Log Files:</u> Log files store information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks, and are used to analyze trends, administer the Websites, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not tie log files to personally identifiable information. </p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2.3 Information Supplied by Third Parties:</strong> We may receive information about you or your use of our or others' websites from other sources, including through the placement of our cookie or similar technology on third party merchant, partner and advertising sites. For example, we may receive product search or purchase information from merchants whose sites you visit after clicking on a product listing on our Website, updated or corrected contact information from third party vendors, credit or related information as part of vendors' fraud detection services (but only with users or merchant's permission to do so), or contact, demographic and other profile information through your interaction with us through social networking accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter (for example, by adding us as a friend on Facebook, following our Twitter account, or engaging in Facebook's "Like" feature). We also may receive or collect similar information from co-branded partners' sites that you visit.</p> <p><strong>2.4 Combining Information:</strong> We may combine the information that we receive about you from different sources. For example, information about your use of one of our Websites may be combined with information about your use of a different Website or a co-branded partners' site. </p> <li><strong>USES OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br> We may use the information that we collect or receive to create a user profile in connection with your account.

We may provide third parties, including merchants, partners and advertisers with such statistics, but never in a way that would make the information personally identifiable. This data is aggregated from millions of users who visit the Websites each month.</p> <p><u>Anonymous Information:</u> We may provide your anonymous use and browsing information, including the search queries that you enter or products that you view on our site, to third parties, which may include allowing merchants, partners and advertisers, to place cookies and/or web beacons on the Websites and/or clear gifs in our HTML emails to allow third parties to optimize and/or provide you with advertisements that are tailored to your interests.</p> <p><u>Merchants and Partners:</u> If you click from the Websites to visit a merchant or other partner, we may provide information about your use of the Websites, such as your search queries, to the merchant or partner, to allow them to provide results that are more tailored to your interests.</p> <p><u>Co-Branded Partners:</u> Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom we may jointly offer a Website, service or feature. Information that you provide or that we collect on a co-brand site may be provided to both us and the Co-Branded Partner.

The privacy policy that governs the collection and use of the information will be present on these pages so you always know whose privacy practices govern the collection and use of the information that you submit. The Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.</p> <p><u>Service Providers:</u> We may use external service providers to facilitate, improve or outsource elements of our service or operation of the Websites, including processing credit card transactions, sending emails, and providing marketing assistance or analysis.

We also may release information from or about you without a subpoena, court order or other substantially similar legal procedure to law enforcement entities or third parties when we believe release is necessary to comply with the law; to protect our rights, property, or the integrity of the Websites, or the rights or property of our merchants/service providers, customers, users or third parties; or to prevent or investigate illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threat to the physical safety of any person, or violation of our Terms of Use or other agreement between you and us. Further we can (and you authorize us to) disclose information from or about you to consumers who have alleged fraud or any other consumer dispute relating to their transactions and/or communications with you.</p> <p><u>Other Trusted Parties:</u> We may provide your contact information and other personal data to trusted third parties so they may provide information to you on products and services that may be of interest to you.</p> <p><u>Advertisers:</u> We may share information with advertisers as described in the Interest-Based Advertising section below.</p> <li><strong>ACCESSING, DELETING AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong></li> <p>Registered users can review, update, amend, delete/remove personally identifiable information by signing in using your member name or email address and password, and in some cases, logging in through your social networking account, and then clicking on your "Account" or "Profile" link.
