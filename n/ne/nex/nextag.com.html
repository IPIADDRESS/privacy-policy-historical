<p>NexTag respects your privacy and we want you to be confident in sharing your information with us. We've written the following statement to disclose any of the information we gather while you are using our site.</p>

<p>We do not share any identifiable information with any third party at any point in your relationship with us as a valuable customer without your permission.</p>

<p>We collect certain technical information to insure that our site is working properly. For example, when you are browsing, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to help administer our Web site.</p>

<p>Your IP address is also used at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our site. We may provide third parties with statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related site information. This data is collected from millions of user visits to our site each month and does not contain any personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Cookies are used to help make your use of our site more enjoyable. NexTag creates these cookie files on your hard drive through your browser and uses them to save information on your NexTag username, zip code and site preferences so you can avoid re-entry of this information each time you visit our site. Cookies also help us to deliver content specific to your interests. You may decline our cookies if your web browser software permits, although this may prevent you from accessing certain features on our site.</p>

<p><b>NexTag does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer.</b></p>

<p>The information we may request from you is outlined below. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@nextag.com?subject=Link%20from%20Help%20Section">support@nextag.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Zip Code:</b> In order to use the total price functionality on our site, (i.e. finding out total price including the cost of shipping and sales tax) we ask you for your zip code.  
</p><p><b>Email Address:</b> If you wish to register for either Price Alerts (through our Watch List feature) or our Buyer's Alert Newsletter, we require that you provide us with your email address.
</p><p><b>Basic Contact Info:</b> When a visitor decides to become a registered user, we ask for some basic contact information (i.e. username, zip code and email address). We use this basic contact information to facilitate the use of certain features of our site (e.g. total price and submission of seller reviews) and to send the user information about our company. We also use email addresses to communicate occasional offers from our partners and advertisers.
</p><p><b>Complete Contact Info:</b> When a registered user decides to become a seller, we collect complete contact information, i.e. full name, address and phone number as well as credit card number and expiration date. This information is only used by NexTag to validate the user's identity and to bill the user for services provided by NexTag.  All credit card information is encrypted and, with the exception of our credit card processing service, is not shared with any third party at any time without your approval.

</p><p><b>The use of personally identifiable information is limited to the following:</b>
</p><ul>
	<li>To contact a user in response to a customer service question from the user or to resolve a dispute between users.</li>
	<li>To process credit card payments approved in advance by a user.</li>
	<li>To allow a user to send an email to another user who is listing an item for sale on our site.</li>
	<li>To share NexTag-specific information.</li>
	<li>To distribute occasional promotional material from our partners and advertisers.</li>
	<li>To assist law enforcement or other governmental agencies investigating cases of possible illegal activities by third parties.</li>
</ul>
We take reasonable precautions to maintain the security of the personal information you provide to our site and to only share this information with third parties that agree to honor our privacy policy. In addition to standard firewall protection, we use Secure Socket Layers ("SSL") technology to protect this information. Additionally, third parties displaying advertisements on our site may also use cookies. NexTag does not control the use of cookies by third parties. The use of cookies by these companies is subject to their own privacy policies, which you may review by visiting their websites. Currently, NexTag has relationships with the following third-party ad networks:  <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com">DoubleClick, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.worldata.com">WebConnect, Inc.</a>
