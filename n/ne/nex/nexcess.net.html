                          NEXCESS.NET, L.L.C. ("NEXCESS.NET") is the 
                          sole owner of the information collected on this site. 
                          We will not sell, share, or rent this information to 
                          others in ways different from what is disclosed in this 
                          statement. NEXCES.NET collects information from our 
                          users at several different points on our website.<br>
                          <br>
                          <span class="sitenormalstrong">Order</span><br>
                          We request information from the user on our order form. 
                          Here a user must provide contact information (like name 
                          and shipping address) and financial information (like 
                          credit card number, expiration date). This information 
                          is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s 
                          orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this 
                          contact information is used to get in touch with the 
                          user.<br>

                          A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s 
                          hard drive containing information about the user. Usage 
                          of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable 
                          information while on our site. Once the user closes 
                          their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, 
                          by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not 
                          have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving 
                          time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, 
                          they may still use our site. Cookies can also enable 
                          us to track and target the interests of our users to 
                          enhance the experience on our site.<br>

                          We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the 
                          site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic 
                          information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
                          linked to personally identifiable information. We use 
                          these same log files to generate our usage report for 
                          your site if you are one of our current clients.<br>

                          surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the

                          information. When users submit sensitive information 
                          via the website, your information is protected both 
                          online and off-line. </p>
                        <p align="justify" class="sitenormal">When our registration/order 
                          form asks users to enter sensitive information (such

                          that information is encrypted and is protected with 
                          the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. 
                          While on a secure page, such as our order form, the

                          the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted 
                          in our offices. Only employees who need the information 
                          to perform a specific job (for example, our billing 
                          clerk or a customer service representative) are granted 
                          access to personally identifiable information. Our employees 
                          must use password-protected screen-savers when they 
                          leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter 
                          their password to re-gain access to your information. 
                          Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our 
                          security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well 
                          as any time new policies are added, our employees are 
                          notified and/or reminded about the importance we place 
                          on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ 
                          information is protected. Finally, the servers that 
                          we store personally identifiable information on are 
                          kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
