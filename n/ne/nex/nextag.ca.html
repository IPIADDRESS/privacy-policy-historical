This Website Privacy Statement is designed to inform you of the types of information we collect from users, how we use that information, and the circumstances under which we will share it with third parties. This Website Privacy Statement applies only to the Websites. It does not apply to your use of any other websites (whether or not operated by us), including any websites to which we provide links or websites of our partners or advertisers, or to any activities which are not online. Some services referenced in this Privacy Statement are not available on some Websites. Portions of this Website Privacy Statement that pertain to such features or services may not be applicable on each of the Websites.</p><p>This Privacy Statement applies to all "users", including those who visit the Websites without being registered.

Examples of situations where you may submit information include:</p><ul><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Account or Profile Information:</span> On some of the Websites, you may become a registered user or register for email notices from us. If you do, we ask for some basic contact information, such as a username, ZIP Code and email address. In some cases, as described below, you may enter additional account information. You also may choose to provide other information, either as part of your public profile or otherwise, such as your age, gender or interests.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Order Processing Information:</span> We may allow checkout or payment processing features on the Websites to facilitate your purchase of products from merchants. The checkout or payment processing services are provided by a third party service provider, and all sales are made by the merchant. The service provider will collect information that is needed to process the order, such as credit card and related information like your billing address, as well as information that is needed for your order, such as your shipping address and the products that you purchased. This information is transmitted by the service provider to the merchant to complete your order. This information may be collected and stored by the third party service provider and/or the merchant in order to complete these functions. The service provider also may provide us with your contact information (such as name and email address) as well as product purchase information. Our privacy policy will apply to information that we collect or receive, the service provider's privacy policy will apply to information that it collects or receives and the merchant's privacy policy will apply to information that we, our service provider, or you provide to the merchant.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Customer Service:</span> You may elect to provide us with information about your purchases, such as customer service requests or information about merchant issues.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Content or Correspondence Submitted By You:</span> If you choose to post content on any of the Websites (for example, a product or merchant review, wish list, or comment or discussion forums), or submit personal correspondence to Nextag, we may collect and maintain that information in a file specific to you. Our Websites may also allow you to interact and share personal information and data with others. For example, some of the Websites allow you to create lists of products that are interesting to you. The default for certain lists is for the list to be publicly available. You may change the privacy setting of your lists as provided on the Websites. Additionally, some of the Websites may allow you to share information on social networks, as described in the section "Social Networks".</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Social Networks:</span> Some of the Websites allow you to register or login to an account you already have with a social networking account, such as Facebook. If you decide to login via a social networking account, we receive information about you from the social networking account, which can include your name, profile picture, email address, gender, user ID, and comments made on the social networking account site. Logging in to our Websites via a social networking account is always optional, but may allow you to publish your activity or interactions with our Websites to your social network account, such as Facebook or Twitter. The information we collect, and the social network's use of any information that you publish to it, may depend on the privacy settings you have with the social networking account or the social network's privacy policy, so be sure to consult your social networking account's privacy settings, and the social networking account's privacy policy and terms of use.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Social Media Widgets:</span> Our Website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons and Widgets. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Blog:</span> Our Website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:legalnotices@nextag.com">legalnotices@nextag.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Survey / Contest:</span> We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to improve our site, notify you if you won a contest or to send you an email newsletter or other marketing materials. We use SurveyMonkey a third party service provider to conduct these surveys; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Links to Third Parties:</span> Our Site includes links to other Websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Nextag.
