<p><strong>Information We Collect on the Website</strong><br>
<strong>Collection of Usage Information.</strong>&nbsp;When users come to our Website, we automatically collect “Usage Information” which include among other things, which pages of our Website were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were “clicked.” We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Website. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer, phone, tablet or other device used to access the Website (any, a “Device”), operating system and browser software used by each user of the Website. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat it as Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
<strong>Technology Used on the Website.</strong>&nbsp;We also use or may use cookies, web beacons and/or embedded scripts to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Website links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Website, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use. Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the Nerdist servers. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Website and related functionalities. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.<br>
Cookies, web beacons and embedded script allow Nerdist to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our Website. Cookies, web beacons and embedded script are not used to retain Personally Identifiable Information. You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of this Website may not work properly, but you do not have to accept our cookies in order to use many functionalities of the Website.<br>
California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b)(as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Nerdist responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. Nerdist does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.<br>
<strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information.</strong>&nbsp;In order to access certain features and benefits on our Website, you may need to submit “Personally Identifiable Information” (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name, address, telephone number and email address. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Nerdist. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Website, the information you receive when using the Website, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate with you. We may collect Personally Identifiable Information in connection with various functionality and services offered via the Website, including the following:<br>
1.&nbsp;<strong>Updates and Newsletters.</strong>&nbsp;Nerdist may offer you the ability to receive email updates and newsletters. In order to subscribe to these services, you may be required to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, email address and zip code.<br>
2.&nbsp;<strong>Participation in Contests, Sweepstakes, and Other Promotions.</strong>&nbsp;Nerdist may offer you the opportunity to participate in a contest, sweepstakes, or other promotions on or through the Website. If you desire to participate in any such contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion, you will be asked to provide us with certain information necessary to conduct such contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion. This information may include, among other things, your name, age, mailing address, email address, and phone number.<br>
3.&nbsp;<strong>Communications with Nerdist.</strong>&nbsp;We may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you send us an email message or otherwise contact us.<br>
4.&nbsp;<strong>Social Media Interaction.</strong>&nbsp;We may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you engage with our Website on or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook or Twitter, and allow us to have access to information from your profile (e.g., name, email address, photo, gender, birthday, location, friends, followers, the posts or the ‘likes’ you make). You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social networking sites. For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how such third-party sites treat your Personally Identifiable Information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.<br>
5.&nbsp;<strong>Metadata.</strong>&nbsp;Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other’s APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if you make your photo public by posting it on our Website.<br>

<strong>Public Forums/User Content</strong><br>
When you post User Content (as defined herein and in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legendary.com/about/terms/">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;on the Website) you do so at your own risk. Nerdist cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your content and Personally Identifiable Information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to websites, blogs, message boards, chat rooms or any other public forums, such information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications.

With regard to advertisements, we and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Website and other web sites.
