	<p>(Revised 3/15/13)</p>
	<p>By using this Site and submitting information, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement.</p>
	<p>Sierra Bravo Corp., dba The Nerdery (the “Company”) has a strong commitment to protecting personal privacy. We will respect certain privacy principles regarding the personal information that you provide. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to tell you what information we gather on our website, how we use the information, and how we protect your privacy.</p>
	<p>This Privacy Statement applies to the Company websites, with the homepage, located at www.nerdery.com, and all subsections under this homepage (the “Site” or “Website”). This Privacy Statement does not apply to information we gather by mail, telephone, in-person, or other off-line methods.</p>
	<h2>PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY.</h2>
	<p>The ways we protect and use information collected through our Website depends on the purposes for which we collected the information, and the type of information collected. In general, personal information – information that tells us who you are – is used only for limited purposes and receives strong protection. Non-personal information – anonymous information that does not tell us who you are – is used for many purposes and shared with others, as described below.</p>
	<h2>HOW WE COLLECT, USE AND PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h2>
	<p>All information that you provide on the Website is voluntary. If you submit personal information, you agree that we may keep a record of that personal information. You also agree that if you choose not to provide all requested information, our ability to provide the requested information or consider your job candidacy may be limited. </p>
	<p>Newsletters &amp; Events. We may collect personal information, including a name, email, and other contact and personal information, such as a home address, from you if you register for our newsletter or an event on our website. For example, we may keep a record of your name and e-mail address in order to keep track of your newsletter preferences or event registration. We also may use registration information to help us in our business, including but not limited to improving this Site, marketing, and recruiting. You agree that we may use your personal information to mail or email information to you about our services and events.</p>
	<p>Job Applications. For job applicants, we collect personal information including but not limited to your contact information, job preferences, skills, experience, and personal statements. Our Recruiting team may use this information to assess your candidacy for employment with The Nerdery and may contact you regarding employment opportunities. You agree that we may use your personal information to mail or email information to you about employment opportunities with The Nerdery.</p>
	<p>We will not give or share registration information to a third party to allow that third party to market its goods or services.</p>
	<p>We may also share registration information in connection with a change of control of the Company, merger, transfer, or sale of all or part of the Company or similar transaction, or if required to comply with a law, regulation, court order, or other legal process. We may share registration information to protect our rights or property. </p>
	<h2>THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO NON-NERDERY WEBSITES, FORUMS, OR NETWORKS.</h2>
	<p>If you post, comment, indicate interest or complaint, or share personal information, including photographs, to any public forum on this Site or any social network, blog, or other such forum, upon which The Nerdery has an account, please be aware that any information you submit can be read, viewed, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes over which neither you nor The Nerdery have control. The Nerdery is not responsible for the personal information you choose to provide in these forums.</p>
	<h2>HOW WE COLLECT AND USE NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h2>
	<p>Each time a computer visits this Site to read or download information, we may collect certain information from that computer. This information is automatically collected from the user’s computer and may include information such as the following (“non-personal information”):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Type of web browser being used (for example, Chrome or Firefox)</li>
		<li>Name of the Internet domain from which your computer accessed our Site</li>
		<li>Internet address of the website from which your computer linked directly to our Site</li>
		<li>Date and time the computer accessed our Site</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Non-personal information does not tell us who you are.</p>
	<p>Also, we may place a text file called a cookie in the browser files of computers that visit this Site. Cookies are pieces of information issued by a website that, among other things, allow your computer to utilize all the features on this Site. If and when your computer accepts a cookie, the cookie may be stored on the computer’s hard drive. The information that we collect using cookies is non-personal information. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our Sites may not work properly for you if you do so.</p>
	<p>We will use non-personal information to help us make our Site more useful to visitors and for other business purposes. For example, we may tell business partners how many computers visited this Site. Also, we may use the non-personal information in cookies to help us to personalize this Site according to the preferences you tell us, and make your visit a more convenient experience. We may prepare reports and other materials using non-personal information. Since these reports and materials contain no personal information, we may share them with others.</p>
	<h2>PRIVACY ON NON-NERDERY WEBSITES.</h2>
	<p>This Site may contain links to third-party applications, products, services, or websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave The Nerdery Website.

	<p>We may also provide social media features that enable you to share information with your social networks and to interact with The Nerdery on various social media sites. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you, depending on the feature. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites with which you interact to make sure you understand the information that may be collected, used, and shared by those sites. </p>
