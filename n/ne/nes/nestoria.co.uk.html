<div class="q">Cookies and tracking</div>
<div class="a">
Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enable us to personalise your
visits to this website, simplify the signing-in procedure, keep track
of your preferences and to track the usage of this website.
<p>
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous
unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's
computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.  

</p><p> Each web
site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only
permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you,
not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

</p><p>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all
cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is
different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to
change your cookie preferences). But please note that this may reduce
the functionality of this Site and other websites.  

</p><p> If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Lokku
services at its full potential and personalised to you.

</p><p> Like all websites, our servers automatically record 'log files'
containing information about the volume and characteristics of our
website traffic e.g. IP address, numbers of pages viewed, length of
time spent on site. We use log files to build pictures of how our site
is used that help us to monitor and improve the service.  <b>We cannot
identify you from your log files</b>.
