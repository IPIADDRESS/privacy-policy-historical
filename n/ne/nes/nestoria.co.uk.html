a property as easy as using a search engine.
</div> 
<p> 

</p><div class="q">Introduction</div> 
<div class="a"> We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy 
Policy covers Lokku's treatment of personally identifiable information that
Lokku collects when you are on the Nestoria site
(<a href="http://www.nestoria.co.uk">www.nestoria.co.uk</a>, 
referred to below as "this Site") and when you
use Lokku's services. Please read this privacy policy carefully. By
using this Site and any services we offer via this Site, you are
agreeing to be bound by this policy in respect of the information
collected about you via this Site.
<p>
The policy also gives information about cookies; Lokku use of cookies; and 
how you may disable such cookies. 
</p><p>
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Lokku
does not own or control, or to people that Lokku does not employ or
manage.
</p><p>
If you have any queries or comments about the policy or our use of
your personal information, please get in touch with us via 
<a href="/help/feedback">our feedback form</a>.

<div class="q">Cookies and tracking</div>
<div class="a">
Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enable us to personalise your
visits to this website, simplify the signing-in procedure, keep track
of your preferences and to track the usage of this website.
<p>
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous
unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's
computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.  

</p><p> Each web
site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only
permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you,
not the cookies sent to you by other sites.  

</p><p> Find out more about cookies <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/">allaboutcookies.org</a>.

</p><p>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all
cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is
different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to
change your cookie preferences). But please note that this may reduce
the functionality of this Site and other websites.  

</p><p> If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Lokku
services at its full potential and personalised to you.

</p><p> Like all websites, our servers automatically record 'log files'
containing information about the volume and characteristics of our
website traffic e.g. IP address, numbers of pages viewed, length of
time spent on site. We use log files to build pictures of how our site
is used that help us to monitor and improve the service.  <b>We cannot
identify you from your log files</b>.  
</p></div> <br>

<div class="q">Disabling/Enabling Cookies</div> <div class="a"> 
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the
settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the
interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled.

<div class="q">Email a Friend</div>
<div class="a">
When you use the 'email a friend' feature of this Site we record which
properties you have been sent to the friend solely so that we can
track the popularity of those properties. We record the other details
provided in the email for internal monitoring of the service. We will
NOT add any information collected in this manner to our mailing lists
to protect you and the recipient's privacy.  
</div> <br>

<div class="q">Changes to this Privacy Policy </div>
<div class="a">
Lokku may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any
substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we
will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages.
