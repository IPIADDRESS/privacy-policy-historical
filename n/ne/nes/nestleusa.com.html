<p>Effective: 5/15/2012<br>
Last Updated On: 3/14/2013</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Nestlé USA Consumer Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy (or “Policy”) tells you how Nestlé USA (“Nestlé
USA,” “we,” or “our”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information
about our consumers (“you”). It also tells you how you can access and
update your information and make certain choices about how your
information is used. This Policy covers both our online and offline data
collection activities, including information that we may collect
through our various websites and applications and offline programs and
events. By using a Nestlé USA website or application or by otherwise
giving us your information, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do
not agree to this Policy, you must not use our website or application or
give us any of your information.</p>
<p>If we change the way we handle your information, we will update this
Privacy Policy. For material changes (substantially new practices you
wouldn’t expect from us or that we didn’t previously tell you about), we
will provide a prominent notice at the site or email you at the address
you have provided prior to the change becoming effective. We reserve
the right to make changes to our practices and this Policy at any time,
provided that we follow the procedures above.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy provides important information in the following eight areas:</p>

<p></p>
<h3><a name="ApplyTo"></a>1. What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we, Nestlé USA,
collect from or about our consumers through the methods described below.
This Policy does NOT apply to information collected by our parent
company, affiliate companies, or joint venture partners.</p>
<p>Please note we may combine information that we collect via one method
(e.g., a Nestlé USA website) with information that we collect via
another method (e.g., a Nestlé USA offline event). We do this to get a
more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us to serve
you better and with more customization.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Nestlé USA websites</span></em></p>
<p>This refers to any consumer-directed websites operated by Nestlé USA,
including sites that we operate under our own domains/URLs and sites
that we run on third party social networks such as Facebook. This Policy
will only apply to the Nestlé USA site if it provides a direct link to
this page.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Nestlé USA mobile sites/apps</span></em></p>
<p>This refers to any consumer-directed mobile sites or applications
operated by Nestlé USA, including our WAP sites and smartphone apps
(e.g., iPhone apps). This Policy will only apply to the Nestlé USA
mobile site/app if it provides a direct link to this page.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Nestlé USA text messaging programs</span></em></p>
<p>This refers to any consumer-directed text messaging programs operated
by Nestlé USA. These programs might be advertised on one of our
websites or applications or in a print ad. <strong>This Policy will only apply to the Nestlé USA text messaging program if the program indicates that this Policy applies.</strong></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Offline registration cards</span></em></p>
<p>This refers to printed registration and similar cards that we may
collect from consumers via postal mail, in-store demos, or other offline
events. <strong>This Policy will only apply to a Nestlé USA offline
registration card if the registration card indicates that this Policy
applies.</strong></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Call center registrations</span></em></p>
<p>This refers to information that we may collect from consumers through
our call center, for example if you call us with a question or comment
or to sign up for marketing communications over the phone.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Data from other sources</span></em></p>
<p>This refers to information we may obtain about you from other
sources. For example, we may hire a third party data aggregator to
provide us additional information about our existing consumers (this is
known as “data appending”). We may also receive information from third
party co-sponsors who we may occasionally partner with to run special
contests or other promotions. We may also receive information about
consumers when we acquire other companies.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="WhatCollect"></a>2. What information do we collect?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Depending on how you interact with Nestlé USA (online, offline, over
the phone, etc.), we may collect from you various types of information,
as described below. In some instances (and unless we say otherwise
below), we may combine one type of information with another type of
information, and store them together in our records. We strive to limit
the amount of information we collect and store to that which is
reasonably necessary to provide you the relevant services. We generally
store your information for as long as your account is active with us or
as needed to provide you the relevant services. We may store your
information for a longer period of time to comply with legal or
regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for
records management purposes.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="PersonalContact"></a>Personal contact info</span></em></p>
<p>This includes any information that would allow us to personally
contact you, such as your name, home or mailing address, phone number
(home, cell, etc.), or email address. In some cases, this could include
information that you give us about someone else (for example, if you
provide a friend’s email address for a tell-a-friend program). We
typically collect personal contact information in connection with a
variety of activities, including general website registration,
newsletter sign-up, <a href="#WebsiteCommunity">website community features</a>, <a>online purchases</a>, <a href="#CustomerService">customer service inquiries</a>, <a href="#ContestsPromos">contests and other promotions</a>,
and consumer surveys. If you create an account with us, your personal
contact information may be stored under your account profile.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="AccountLoginInfo&quot;"></a>Account login info</span></em></p>
<p>This refers to any information that is required for you to establish a
unique account with us or for us to give you access to your specific
account profile. Examples may include your login ID/email address,
screen name, password, and/or security question and answer. We only
collect unique login information for those activities that require an
account, such as general website registration, newsletter sign-up, and <a href="#WebsiteCommunity">website community features</a>.
Your login information, especially your password, should be kept
confidential and never shared with anyone else. To change your login
email address or password, log in to the relevant edit account section
of our site (if available) or contact <a href="#ContactInfo">Consumer Services</a>.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="Demographic"></a>Demographic info</span></em></p>
<p>This includes any information that describes your demographic or
psychographic characteristics. Examples may include your date of birth,
age or age range, gender, geographic location (e.g., zip code, city and
state, mobile location), favorite products, hobbies and interests, and
household or lifestyle information. We typically collect demographic
information in connection with a variety of activities, including
general website registration, newsletter sign-up, <a href="#WebsiteCommunity">website community registration</a>, <a href="#ContestsPromos">contests and other promotions</a>,
and consumer surveys. If you create an account with us, you may be
allowed to modify certain demographic information stored under your
account. To do so, log in to the relevant edit account section of our
site (if available) or contact <a href="#ContactInfo">Consumer Services</a>.
For demographic information stored under your profile on a third party
social network (e.g., Facebook), see separate paragraph on “<a href="/admin/socialnetworkinfo">Social network info</a>.”</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="TechnicalComputerInfo"></a>Technical computer info</span></em></p>
<p>This includes any information about the computer system or other
technological device that you may be using to access one of our websites
or applications. We typically collect this information through
automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons. Examples of
technical computer information may include your computer’s IP address,
operating system type, and web browser type. If you access a Nestlé USA
website or application via a mobile device such as a smartphone, the
collected information may also include your phone’s unique device ID,
geo-location, and other similar mobile device data. Technical computer
information may be linked to your <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a>.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="WebsiteUsageInfo"></a>Website usage info</span></em></p>
<p>This includes information about how you use and navigate our websites
and applications, including which links you click on, which pages or
content you view and for how long, and other similar information and
statistics about your interactions with a Nestlé USA website or
application (e.g., date and time of visit, which site you came from,
favorite recipes and site activities, high game scores, etc.). This
information is captured using automated technologies such as browser
cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons, and may also be collected
through the use of third party tracking services (such as Google
Analytics) that collect data in aggregate (such as number of visits to a
particular page, or the amount of time spent on a web site). We may
also use these technologies, such as web beacons, to capture information
about how users respond to certain email campaigns (e.g., time the
email is opened, where user links to from the email, etc.). Website
usage information may be linked to your <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a> for web site personalization and marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Please note that “flash” cookies are different from "browser” cookies
because of the way in which flash cookies capture and store data. Your
browser’s cookie management tools will not remove flash cookies. To

<p>We also partner with a third party ad network to either display
advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites.
Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect
non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this
and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your
interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose
of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Consumer feedback<a name="ConsumerFeedback"></a></span></em></p>
<p>This includes information that you voluntarily share with us about
your experience in using our products and services, including our
websites and applications. Examples may include unsolicited comments and
suggestions, testimonials, or other questions or feedback related to
our products. We typically collect this information in the form of
consumer surveys, consumer panels, contact forms, “Ask the Expert”
forms, and email correspondence.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="ConsumerGen"></a>Consumer-generated content</span></em></p>
<p>This refers to any content that you create and then share with us
(and perhaps others) by uploading it to one of our websites or
applications, including one of our Facebook sites. Examples may include
photos, videos, personal stories, or other similar media or content. We
may collect and publish <a href="#ConsumerGen">consumer-generated</a> content in connection with a variety of activities, including <a href="#ContestsPromos">contests and other promotions</a>, <a href="#WebsiteCommunity">website community features</a>, <a href="#ConsumerEngagement">consumer engagement</a>, and <a href="#ThirdPartySocialNetworking">third party social networking</a>.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="SocialNetworkInfo"></a>Social network info</span></em></p>
<p>This refers to any information that is part of your profile on a
third party social network (such as Facebook) and that you allow the
third party social network to share with us. Examples include your basic
account information (e.g., name, email address, gender, birthday,
current city, profile picture, user ID, list of friends, etc.) and any
other additional information or activities that you permit the third
party social network to share with third party application developers.
For example, we may receive your social network profile information (or
parts of it) every time you download or interact with a Nestlé USA web
application on a social network such as Facebook or every time you use a
social networking feature that is integrated within a Nestlé USA site
(such as Facebook Connect). To learn more about how your information
from a third party social network may be obtained by Nestlé USA (or
other third party application developers), please visit the website of
the relevant social network.</p>

<p>This includes any information that you use to make a purchase, such
as your credit card details (cardholder name, card number, expiration
date, etc.) or other forms of payment (if such are made available). This
also includes the billing name and address associated with your form of
payment. If you create an account with us when making a purchase, your
payment information may be stored under your account profile. To review
or edit this information, log in to the relevant edit account section of
our site (if one is available) or contact the customer service
department listed at the relevant store website.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>This refers to any other information that we might need to collect
for a specific Nestlé USA form, feature, or other service that you use

method of collection and the specific purpose(s) for which the
information is being collected. Please see <a href="#HowUse">Section 3 (“How do we use your information?”)</a> for more specific examples.</p>

reason for your inquiry (e.g., order status, technical issue, product
question/complaint, general question, etc.). Customer service may be

<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="MarketingCommunications"></a>Marketing communications</span></em></p>
<p>We may collect and use your information to send you marketing
communications, such as email communications, SMS text messages, and
postal mailings. Please note that if you choose to receive SMS text
messages, your plan fees for messaging will apply. These communications
will keep you up-to-date on the latest news, events, special offers, and
promotions from the Nestlé USA brands of interest to you. On occasion,
these communications may also introduce you to other Nestlé brands and
inform you about offers and promotions from other third party companies.
Sending you marketing communications mostly requires the collection and
use of certain <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a> and <a href="#Demographic">demographic information</a>.
In some instances (such as for mobile apps and text messaging
programs), this could involve the use of your precise geo-location,
which may allow us to send you location-based offers and promotions.</p>
<p>You can always opt-out from receiving marketing-related email
communications or text messages by following the unsubscribe
instructions provided in each such communication. If you have an account
with us, you may be given the option to change your communication
preferences under the relevant edit-account section of our site (if
available) or by contacting <a href="#ContactInfo">Consumer Services</a>.
Please note that even if you opt out from receiving marketing
communications, you may still receive administrative communications from
us, such as order confirmations, notifications about your account
activities (e.g., account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and
other important announcements.</p>
<p>Also, please note that if you participated in a promotion that
involved a third party company, and, as part of that promotion, you
agreed to receive future marketing communications directly from that
third party, you will need to contact the third party (not Nestlé USA)
to opt-out from such communications. This process may be outlined in the
third party’s privacy policy.</p>

<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="ThirdPartySocialNetworking"></a>Third party social networking</span></em></p>
<p>We may collect and use your information when you interact with third
party social networking features such as “Facebook Connect” or “Facebook
Like”. These features may be integrated in our sites or applications
for the purposes of running contests, allowing you to share content with
friends, or other stated purposes. If you use these features, we may
have the ability to obtain certain information about you from your
social networking profile (see “<a href="#SocialNetworkInfo">Social network information</a>”
under Section 2 of this Policy). You can learn more about how these
features work, and the profile data we may obtain about you, by visiting
the website of the relevant third party social network.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Website improvement and personalization</span></em></p>
<p>We may collect and use your information to improve and personalize
your experience on our websites and applications. This is typically done
through automated technologies (such as cookies) that collect and
remember certain <a href="#AccountLoginInfo">account login information</a>, <a href="#TechnicalComputerInfo">technical information</a>, and/or previous <a href="#WebsiteUsageInfo">website usage information</a>.
For example, we might remember your login ID/email address or screen
name so you can quickly login the next time you visit our site or so you
can easily retrieve the items you previously placed in your shopping
cart. Based on this type of information, we may also show you specific
Nestlé USA content or promotions that are tailored to your interests.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="WebsiteCommunity"></a>Website community features</span></em></p>
<p>We may collect and use your information to give you access to website
community features, including features that may allow you to upload and
share recipes, pictures, videos, artwork, or other messages or content.
This typically involves the collection, use, and (in some instances)
public display of certain <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a>, <a href="#AccountLoginInfo">account login information</a>, <a href="#Demographic">demographic information</a>, and/or <a href="#ConsumerGen">consumer-generated content</a>.
Because these features are “communal” in nature, information or content
that you post in these areas may be visible to others. Please use
caution when using these features or uploading content to a Nestlé USA
site. For some community features, we may give you the ability to
control whether some parts of your profile can be seen by others. To
access these settings, log in to the relevant edit account section of
our site (if one is available) and access your community profile. For
website community features that have social networking integration (such
as “Facebook Connect”), see separate paragraph on “<a href="#ThirdPartySocialNetworking">Third party social networking</a>.”</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Website viral features (e.g., tell-a-friend)</span></em></p>
<p>We may request and use your information so you can use website viral
features, such as our tell-a-friend features. These features allow you
to easily share certain Nestlé USA news, product information,
promotions, wish list items, or other content with family members and
friends. These features typically require the collection and use of <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a>
(such as names and email addresses) so that the selected one-time
message or content can be delivered to the proper recipients. In most
cases, we do not retain the information provided. In some cases (for
example, as part of a refer-a-friend program), we may store the
information so we can track and reward consumers for their successful
referrals. For tell-a-friend or other viral features administered by
third party social networks (such as Facebook’s “Share” and “Like”
features), please refer to the website of the relevant social network
for additional information.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Order fulfillment</span></em></p>
<p>We may collect and use your information to process and ship your
orders, and to inform you about the status of your orders. This could
involve the collection and use of certain <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a>, <a href="#PaymentInfo">payment information</a>, <a href="#AccountLoginInfo">account login information</a>,
and/or other information related to your purchase (such as products
ordered). This could also involve the ongoing storage of your payment
information to allow for easier checkout on future purchases.</p>
<p>Please note that there are many independent e-commerce sites that
sell Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé
USA. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we
recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any
purchases on those sites.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Other general purposes (e.g., website security, internal research)</span></em></p>
<p>We may collect and use your information for other general business
purposes, such as to maintain the day-to-day operation and security of
our websites and applications and to conduct internal marketing and
demographic studies. These activities mostly require the collection and
use of certain <a href="#Demographic">demographic information</a>, <a href="#TechnicalComputerInfo">technical computer information</a>, <a href="#WebsiteUsageInfo">website usage information</a>, and <a href="#ConsumerFeedback">consumer feedback</a>.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="WithWhom"></a>4. With whom do we share your information?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We may share your information with the types of companies or in the
situations described below. We do not rent or sell your information to
third party companies for their own marketing use.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Agents and contractors</span></em></p>
<p>These are outside companies, agencies, or contractors that we hire to
help us run our business (e.g., fulfill orders, operate our websites,
run promotions, provide website development, operate our call center,
etc.). The information shared with our agents and contractors could
include <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a>, <a href="#PaymentInfo">payment information</a>, <a href="#Demographic">demographic information</a>,
or other types of information depending on the services being provided,
and may require that we transfer your information to locations outside
the United States. Agents and contractors are only allowed to access and
use your information for the specific tasks they’ve been hired to do
and are required to keep your information confidential and secure.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Joint sponsors and other partners</span></em></p>
<p>These are outside third party companies who we occasionally partner
with to run joint promotions or offer you separate third party
promotions. The information shared with these third party companies will
vary depending on the promotion, and may be used by them for their own
separate marketing purposes. If any of your <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a>
will be collected by or shared with a third party partner for its own
marketing purposes, we will notify you at the time of information
collection and give you the opportunity to opt-in or out of the sharing,
as the case may be. For online promotions, we may also provide you a
link to the third party’s privacy policy.</p>
<p><em><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the right to request
and receive certain information about our disclosure of your personal
information to third parties for their own marketing use, and your
choices with respect to such disclosures. Because we do not share your
personal information with third parties for their own marketing use
unless you are first given the opportunity to opt-in or out (as set
forth above), we are exempt from having to meet this requirement. If you
still wish to learn more about our compliance with this requirement,
you may contact <a href="#ContactInfo">Consumer Services</a>.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Legal disclosures (when necessary)</span></em></p>
<p>This is when we may need to share your information for law
enforcement or other legal-related purposes. This may be necessary in
connection with a lawsuit, claim or investigation, governmental inquiry,
court order, enforcement of legal rights (e.g., contract terms,
intellectual property rights, etc.), safety issue, or other similar
legal or security matter. Sharing your information for these reasons is
not a regular event, but could arise from time to time. We strive to
limit the types and amount of information we share for legal-related
purposes to that which is reasonably necessary.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Business transfers (e.g., sale or acquisition of company)</span></em></p>
<p>We may share (or receive) information about you, including <a href="#PersonalContact">personal contact information</a>,
in the event of an acquisition, merger, sale, corporate reorganization,
bankruptcy proceeding, or other similar event that involves Nestlé USA.
If such an event occurs, we will take reasonable steps to require that
your information be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy,
unless it is not practical or permissible to do so.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="HowOptOut"></a>5. How can you opt out and review your information?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>You can always opt-out from receiving marketing-related email
communications or text messages by following the unsubscribe
instructions provided in each such communication. Please read our <a href="#MarketingCommunications">Marketing communications</a> section for limitations on certain administrative communications, order confirmations, and account notifications.</p>
<p>Many of our sites have a “your account or “your profile” feature
where you may review and edit the information you have provided and you
may be given the option to change your communication preferences,
including opting out. If an edit account or profile feature is not
available or you otherwise desire to access, edit, or remove your
information, contact <a href="#ContactInfo">Consumer Services</a> and we will respond to your access request within 30 days.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="HowProtect"></a>6. How do we protect your information?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We use a variety of standard methods (described below) to keep
consumer information confidential and secure. Please note, however, that
these protections do not apply to information you choose to share in
public areas such as our <a href="#WebsiteCommunity">website community features</a> or other social areas.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Secure operating environments</span></em></p>
<p>We store your information in secure operating environments that are
protected from the public and that we only allow authorized Nestlé USA
employees and agents/contractors to access on a need-to-know basis. We
follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal
information; however, no method of transmission over the Internet, or
method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot
guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Encryption for payment info</span></em></p>
<p>We use industry-standard encryption to provide greater protection for
sensitive financial information, such as credit card information, sent
to us over the web. For example, encryption is used when you make
payments through our online stores. Please note, however, that there are
many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestlé products but that
are not controlled or operated by Nestlé USA. Because these sites may
have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their
privacy policies before making any purchases.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prior authentication for account access</span></em></p>
<p>We require our registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g.,
login ID/email address, password) before they can access or make changes
to their account information. This helps prevent unauthorized access to
your account.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Measures we expect you to take</span></em></p>
<p>It is important for you to also play a role in keeping your
information safe and secure. When signing up for an online account,
please be sure to choose an account password that is hard for others to
guess and never reveal your password to anyone else. If you use a shared
or public computer, never choose to have your login ID/email address or
password remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time
you leave the computer. You should also make use of any privacy
settings or controls we may provide you in our website community areas.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="OtherInfo"></a>7. Other important information</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This section provides additional information that is important for you to know about this Policy or our practices.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">This policy applies to consumers only</span></em></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our collection and use of information from consumers, using the methods described under <a href="#ApplyTo">Section 1</a>
of this Policy. It does not apply to our business customers (e.g.,
retailers, distributors, etc.). It also does not apply to information we
might collect and use for employment-related purposes (e.g., resumes,
job applications, etc.) or business-to-business related purposes (e.g.,
media inquiries, investor relations, etc.).</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">We do not knowingly collect info from children</span></em></p>
<p>We do not solicit or collect any type of information from a person
that we know is under the age of 13. If we discover that we’ve
accidentally collected information from a child, we will attempt to
remove that child’s information from our records as soon as feasibly
possible.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">We are not responsible for third party sites/features</span></em></p>
<p>Our websites and applications may provide links to, or features from,
other third party sites (such as independent e-commerce sites and third
party social networks). If you link to or use such third party sites or
features, you do so at your own risk. We do not control and are not
responsible for the content or practices of any third party site,
application, or feature.</p>

<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">We have been awarded the TRUSTe Privacy Seal</span></em></p>
