<ul>
    <li>Orders - to process and ship your orders and to inform you about the status of your orders.

    <li>Personalisation - Nestlé may combine personal data about you collected from one source (e.g. a website) with data collected from another source (e.g. an offline event). This provides Nestlé with a more complete view of you as a consumer, which, in turn, allows Nestlé to serve you better and with greater personalisation, including in respect of the following:</li>
    <ol style="list-style:none">
        <li>
        <div class="faqQuestion"><em>Websites -</em> to improve and personalise your experience on websites, using data such as account login information, technical computer information, and/or previous website usage information;</div>

One way Nestlé does this is to match activities or information collected on Nestlé Sites with data collected about you on third party sites (i.e. data-matching). This type of advertising is also known as “online behavioural advertising” or “targeted advertising”. Such personalisation is typically performed via cookies or similar technologies. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <li>Marketing communications - to provide you with marketing communications where you have opted-in to receiving such communications (including information about Nestlé, its products and services, competitions and promotions).

        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="faqQuestion"><em>Website viral features</em><br>

        Nestlé may use your personal data to offer you website viral features, such as a tell-a-friend program, where you can share certain news, product information, promotions or other content with family and friends.<br>
        This typically requires the collection and use of personal contact information (e.g. names and emails) so that the selected one-time message/content can be delivered to their recipients. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="faqQuestion"><em>Third party social networking</em> <br>
        <br>
        Nestlé may use your personal data from when you interact with third party social networking features such as “Facebook Connect” or “Facebook Like”. These features may be integrated on Nestlé Sites including for purposes such as running contests and allowing you to share content with friends. <br>
        If you use these features, Nestlé may have the ability to obtain certain personal data about you from your social networking information. You can learn more about how these features work, and the profile data Nestlé may obtain about you, by visiting the website of the relevant third party social network. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="faqQuestion"><em>Other specific purposes </em> <br>

    <strong>Session cookies - </strong>These are temporary cookie files which are erased when you close your browser. When you restart your browser and go back to the site that created that cookie, the website will treat you as a new visitor.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Persistent cookies – </strong>These cookies stay on your browser until you delete them manually or until your browser deletes them based on the duration period set within the cookie. These cookies will recognize you as a return visitor.
    Necessary cookies - Necessary cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of a Nestlé Site. They enable you to navigate around the site and use our features. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cookies that send information to us -</strong> These are the cookies that we set on a Nestlé Site and they can only be read by that site. This is known as a “First Party” cookie.<br>
    <br>
    We also place cookies on Nestlé advertisements which are placed on other websites owned by third parties (e.g. Facebook). We obtain information via those cookies when you click on or interact with the advertisement. In this situation Nestlé is placing a “Third Party” cookie. Nestlé may use the information obtained by these cookies to serve you with advertising that is relevant and of interest to you based on your past online behaviour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cookies that send information to other companies -</strong> These are cookies that are set on a Nestlé Site by our partner companies (e.g. Facebook or advertisers). They may use the data collected from these cookies to anonymously target advertising to you on other websites, based on your visit to the Nestlé Site. For example, if you use a social widget (e.g. the Facebook icon) on a Nestlé Site, it will record your “share” or “like”. Facebook (as the company setting the cookie) will collect the data.
    <p><strong>7.1.4	Other similar technologies</strong></p>
    <p class="faqQuestion">Nestlé Sites also make use of other tracking technologies including IP addresses, log files and web beacons, which also help us tailor Nestlé Sites to your personal needs. <br>
    <br>
    <em>IP addresses </em><br>
    An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. We may record IP Addresses for the following purposes: (i) troubleshoot technical concerns, (ii) maintain website safety and security (iii) better understand how our websites are utilized, and (iv) to better tailor content to your needs depending on the country you are in. <br>
    <br>
    <em>Log Files </em><br>
    We (or a third party on our behalf) may collect information in the form of logs files that record website activity and gather statistics about a user’s browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help us gather (among other things) (i) a user’s browser type and operating system, (ii) information about a user’s session (such as the URL they came from, the date and time they visited our website, and which pages they've viewed on our website and for how long), and, (iii) other similar navigational or click-stream data (e.g. site traffic reporting and unique visitor counts). </p>
    <p><strong>7.1.5	Manage your cookies/preferences</strong></p>
    <p class="faqQuestion">You should ensure that your computer setting reflects whether you are happy to accept cookies or not. You can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, or you can simply set it to refuse them. You do not need to have cookies on to use or navigate through many parts of Nestlé Sites although you may not have access to all the features on Nestlé Sites if you do so. See the 'help' button on your browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox) for how you can do this. Remember that if you use different computers in different locations, you will need to ensure that each browser is adjusted to suit your cookie preferences. <br>
    <br>
    As a web beacon forms part of a webpage, it is not possible to ‘opt-out’ but you can render them ineffective by opting out of the cookies they set.

<h2 class="faqQuestion">8. 	Data security and retention</h2>
<h2 class="faqQuestion">8.1	Data security</h2>
<p class="faqQuestion">In order to keep your personal data secure, Nestlé has implemented a number of security measures, including:  </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Secure operating environments -</strong> Nestlé stores your data in secure operating environments and only accessible to Nestlé employees, agents and contractors on a need-to-know basis. Nestlé also follows generally accepted industry standards in this respect. </li>
    <li> Encryption for payment information - Nestlé uses industry-standard encryption to provide protection for sensitive financial information, such as credit card information sent over the Internet (e.g. when you make payments through Nestlé’s online stores).
    </li>
    <li>Prior authentication for account access - Nestlé requires its registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g. login ID and password) before they can access or make changes to their account. This is aimed to prevent unauthorized accesses.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>   Please note that these protections do not apply to personal data you choose to share in public areas such as on community websites. </p>
<h2 class="returnToTop">8.2	Retention </h2>
<p class="returnToTop">Nestlé will only retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the stated purpose, taking into account also our need to answer queries or resolve problems, provide improved and new services, and comply with legal requirements under applicable laws.<br>
<br>
This means that we may retain your personal data for a reasonable period after your last interaction with us. When the personal data that we collect is no longer required in this way, we destroy or delete it in a secure manner.
