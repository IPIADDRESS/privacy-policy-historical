    manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognise your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the
    Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the
    general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that
    your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser
    from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie
    in a variety of ways.

    or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer. Ads
    appearing on the Services may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognise your
    computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad

                                    We collect statistical information about how users collectively interact with our Services. Some of this information is derived from Personal Information.
    This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you or your web browser. This type of aggregate data enables us to
    figure out how often users use parts of the Services so that we can make the Services appealing to as many users as possible, and improve them. As part of
    this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of
    statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an
    optimal online experience. Again, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

                                    As part of our Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as communications relating to promotions we are offering
    through or related to our Services. You acknowledge and agree that by posting information on or through our Services, or requesting that we do so on your
    behalf, we and our agents, the landlords or tenants relevant to your request for Services, and others may send you e-mail, contact you or engage in other
    communications that they determine in their sole discretion relate to your profile or use of the Services.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You may opt-out of receiving such communications by following the instructions included with such emails, or emailing us at privacy@needaproperty.com, but
    then you may not have access to certain features of our Services. In addition, we and others you interact with through the Services may wish to send you a
    house-warming gift or other expression of appreciation, and you acknowledge and agree that we may share your Personal Information with such persons, or use
    your Personal Information for such purposes.

                                    <strong>Information shared with our Agents.</strong>
                                    We employ and contract with people and other entities (referred to as our “Agents”) that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control.
    We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide Services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any
    right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of

                                    <strong>Information disclosed pursuant to Business mergers, sales and acquisitions.</strong>
                                    In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets.
    Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the
    assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may
    continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
                                </p>

                                    We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law,
    regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the <strong>Terms of Use</strong> or this <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, including
    investigation of potential violations thereof or hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to
    user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies
    and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.

                                    We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services    <strong>or</strong> sending you an e-mail. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have
    been first posted.
