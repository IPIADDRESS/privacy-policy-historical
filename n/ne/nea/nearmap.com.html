        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The following is a summary of our privacy policy:</p>
        <h4>Collecting personal information</h4>
        <p>
            We collect personal information if you choose to provide it to us, for example by 
            emailing us or entering information about yourself into our website. We also collect navigational data from your use of our website and use 
            cookies to keep track of your use of our website (for example, so that we can 
            remember which NearMap image you were viewing when you last visited our website).
        </p>
        
        <h4>How we use your personal information</h4>
        <p>
            We use personal information you provide us with to obtain a better understanding of 
            your needs and to respond to your queries.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not sell, rent or trade personal information to or with third parties. We may, 
            however, disclose your personal information to third party contractors who provide 
            services to us, or when required by law.
        </p>

        <h4>Your rights</h4>
        <p>
            You can seek access to personal information which we hold about you and ask us to 
            correct personal information which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date.
        </p>

        <h4>How to contact us</h4>
        <p> If you have any questions or comments about this privacy policy, or if you wish to 
            complain about how we have handled personal information about you, please 
            <a href="/nearmap/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            In this privacy policy, "we", "us" and "our" means NearMap Pty Limited 
            (ABN 16 120 677 250) of PO Box 1926, West Perth, Western Australia 6872, Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
            We appreciate that privacy is important to everyone, and we are committed to complying 
            with the National Privacy Principles (<b>NPPs</b>) which are contained in the 
            Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
        </p>
        <p>Personal information is basically information that can identify you.</p>

        <h3>1. What personal information do we collect?</h3>
        <p>
            We collect information from you in the course of providing you with access to our 
            website, including all associated NearMap PhotoMaps and APIs (the <b>Website</b>).
        </p>
        <p>
            We will receive personal information from you if you choose to provide it to us. For 
            example, if you send us an email to enquire about our Website or licence terms, register to use our Community Forum or provide us with information about yourself through the Website. 
            The information we collect from you depends on the services you obtain through the website.  For example, the Community Forum requires you to register if you wish to post content to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our server automatically collects information about your use of the Website 
            (<b>Navigational Data</b>).  Navigational Data includes the type of browser you are 
            using, your IP address, the URL you have come from and the time spent at that URL, 
            cookies and your domain type and server.  This kind of information is collected by 
            many sites. We use this information to monitor your use of our site and your 
            compliance with our licence terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you use our Website, cookies will be placed on your computer to keep track of 
            your use of our Website.  For example, cookies allow us to remember which NearMap 
            image you were viewing when you last visited our website.  Cookies do not capture 
            or track any personal information.  However, you may elect to set your computer so 
            that cookies are not placed on your computer.
        </p>

        <h3>2. How is personal information used?</h3>
        <p>
            We use your personal information to assist us in providing the Website to you, or to 
            respond to your enquiries.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may also use your personal information for a purpose which is outlined at the time 
            of collecting that personal information, or which can reasonably be inferred from the 
            circumstances in which the personal information is supplied.
        </p>
        <p>We may also keep and file all information you send to us.</p>

        <h3>3. Will personal information be given to anyone else?</h3>
        <p>
            In the circumstances described below, personal information may be disclosed outside of 
            our organisation.
        </p>

        <h4>3.1 Third party contractors</h4>
        <p>
            Personal information collected by us may be disclosed to third parties to whom we 
            contract out specialised functions (such as our website hosts). If we do disclose 
            personal information to third party contractors under outsourcing or contracting 
            arrangements, we take steps to ensure that those contractors:
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">(a) comply with the NPPs when they handle your personal information; and</p>
        <p class="hangingindent">(b) are authorised only to use personal information in order to provide the services or to perform the functions required by us.</p>
        
        <h4>3.2 Disclosures required by law</h4>
        <p>
            For legal reasons, other disclosures may need to be made to law enforcement agencies, 
            government agencies, courts or external advisors or in accordance with other laws.
        </p>

        <h4>3.3 Other disclosures</h4>
        <p>We do not sell, rent or trade personal information to or with third parties.</p>

        <h3>4. Access and correction</h3>
        <p>
            Under the Privacy Act, you have a right to seek access to information which we hold 
            about you (although there are some exceptions to this). You also have the right to ask 
            us to correct information about you which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to exercise your right under the Privacy Act to seek access to the 
            personal information that we hold about you, we ask that you contact our Privacy 
            Officer (contact details are set out in <a href="#pp-s7">section 7 below</a>), who 
            will explain how we will handle your access request. We may charge you for the cost 
            of providing access to these records.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are of the view that personal information about you is not accurate, complete 
            or up to date, please provide our Privacy Officer with your request for correction. 
            Our policy is to consider any requests for correction in a timely manner.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Is personal information stored safely?</h3>
        <p>
            We take reasonable steps to ensure the security of personal information held by us 
            from such risks as loss or unauthorised access, destruction, use, modification or 
            disclosure. Our IT systems are password protected and comply with our security 
            standards, and if personal information is held on paper files, it is stored in 
            premises that are locked when unattended.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Third party websites</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes our website contains links to other websites, for your convenience and 
            information. When you access a website other than www.nearmap.com, please understand 
            that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that site. We recommend that 
            you review the privacy policies of each site you visit.
        </p>
