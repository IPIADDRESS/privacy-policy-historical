	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p>This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by nearmap US, Inc. ("nearmap", "we", "us" or "our"). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our website and other online products and services, or when you otherwise interact with us.</p>

	<h3>1. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
	<p>This policy was last updated on 15 September 2015. We might change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will post a notice on our website homepage and make a new copy of the updated Privacy Policy available here. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access our website or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>
	<p>If you disagree with any changes to this Privacy Policy, you will need to stop using the nearmap website and our other products and services.</p>

	<h3>2. Information we collect</h3>
	<h4> 2.1 Information You Provide to Us </h4>
	<p>We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, send us an email to enquire about our website or licence terms, participate in any interactive features of our website or other services, fill out a form, make a purchase, apply for a job, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise provide us with information about yourself. The types of information we may collect includes personal information, which is information or an opinion about you, from which you are, or may reasonably be, identified. This information may include (but is not limited to) your name, date of birth, phone number, email address, address, employment history and any other information you choose to provide.</p>
	<p>Due to the nature of the services provided by us, we do not collect sensitive information (such as information about your religion, trade union membership, political opinion, health, sexual preference or criminal record) or credit information (information about loans that may have been provided to you) about you.</p>
	<p>If you provide information (including personal information) to us about someone else, you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose that information to us and that, without us taking any further steps required by privacy laws, we may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, you should take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of the various matters detailed in this Privacy Policy. The individual must also provide the consents set out in this Privacy Policy in respect of how we will deal with their information.</p>
	<h4>2.2 Information We Collect Automatically When You Use Our Website or Services</h4>
	<p>Our server automatically collects information about your use of our website and other services (Log Data). Log Data includes, among other things, the type of browser you are using, access times, your IP address, the URL you have come from and the time spent at that URL, cookies and your domain type and server. This kind of information is collected by many sites. We use this information to monitor your use of our site and your compliance with our license terms.</p>
	<p>When you use our website, cookies will also be placed on your computer to keep track of your use of our website. For example, cookies allow us to remember which nearmap image you were viewing when you last visited our website. Cookies do not capture or track any personal information.

However, if you do not provide the information requested by us, we may not be able to provide you with our services.</p>
	<h4>2.3 Information We Collect from Other Sources</h4>
	<p>We may also collect personal information about you from third parties that you have authorized to provide us with such information and combine it with information we collect through our website and other services. For example, we may be provided with your information by LinkedIn or other similar service providers. From time to time we may also purchase lists containing information (including personal information) about individuals from organisations offering such lists for marketing purposes.</p>
	<h3>3. How we use information we collect</h3>

	<h3>4. Information sharing and disclosure</h3>
	<p>In the circumstances described below, information may be disclosed outside of our organization.</p>
	<h4>4.1 Third party contractors</h4>
	<p>Information collected by us (including personal information) may be disclosed to third parties to whom we contract out specialized functions (such as our website hosts). If we do disclose personal information to third party contractors under outsourcing or contracting arrangements, we take steps to ensure that those contractors are authorised only to use personal information in order to provide the services or to perform the functions required by us.</p>
	<h4>4.2 Disclosures required by law</h4>
	<p>For legal reasons, other disclosures may need to be made to law enforcement agencies, government agencies, courts or external advisors or in accordance with other laws.</p>
	<h4>4.3 Other disclosures</h4>
	<p>We do not sell, rent or trade personal information to or with third parties for their own uses.</p>
	<p>By providing us with your information (including personal information), you consent to us disclosing your information to the entities set out in clause 4.1 or 4.2 without obtaining your consent on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p>We may from time to time transfer information to countries whose privacy laws do not provide the same level of protection as your own. For example, we may transfer your information (including personal information) to the Asia-Pacific, European Union, or Australia. We may also use cloud storage and IT servers that are located offshore. By accessing or using our website or services or providing us with your information, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United States and other countries.</p>
	<h3>5. Third-party websites</h3>
	<p>Sometimes our website contains links to other websites, for your convenience and information. When you access a website other than us.nearmap.com, please understand that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that site. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of each site you visit.</p>
	<h3>6. Advertising and analytics services provided by others</h3>
	<p>We may allow others to provide advertising and analytics services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of our website, products and services, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by nearmap to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and better understand your online activity.</p>
	<h3>7. Direct marketing</h3>
	<p>From time to time we may use your information (including personal information) to provide you with current information about our products and services, special offers you may find of interest, changes to our organization, or new products or services being offered by us or any company we are associated with. By providing us with information, you consent to us using your information to contact you on an ongoing basis for this purpose, including by mail, email, SMS, social media and telephone.</p>
	<p>If you do not wish to receive marketing information, you may at any time decline to receive such information by contacting our Privacy Contacts using the contact details below. We will not charge you for giving effect to your request and will take all reasonable steps to meet your request at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
	<h3>8. Updating your information</h3>
	<p>It is important to our relationship that the information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. If at any time you are of the view that information about you is not accurate, complete or up to date, please write to us with your request for correction. Our policy is to consider any requests for correction in a timely manner.</p><p>
	</p><h3>9. Accessing your information</h3>
	<p>If you wish to access the information that we hold about you, we ask that you write to us and we will explain how we handle your access request. We may charge you for the cost of providing access to these records.</p>
	<p>There may be situations where we are not required to provide you with access to your information. For example, such a situation would be information relating to an existing or anticipated legal proceeding with you, or if your request is vexatious.</p>
	<p>An explanation will be provided to you if we deny you access to your information we hold.</p>
	<h3>10. Security</h3>
	<p>We take reasonable measures to help protect information held by us from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorised access, destruction, modification or disclosure. Our systems are password protected and comply with our security standards, and if personal information is held on paper files, it is stored in premises that are locked when unattended.</p>
