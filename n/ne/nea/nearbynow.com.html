			<p>At NearbyNow we recognize that privacy is
			important. We hate spam, and detest the practice of selling personal
			information to third parties. But we understand that by sharing some personal
			information we can make our service more useful and enjoyable. This document
			outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use
			NearbyNow services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard the
			information you share. We hope this will help you make an informed decision
			about sharing personal information with us.</p>

			 <li style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
				 mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">For
				 most NearbyNow services, no registration is required and we do not collect
				 personal information. However, for some services (such as a "sale alert"
				 service), we may require collecting personal information that can identify
				 you, such as an e-mail, cell phone number, or other contact information,
				 as part of our registration.</li>
			 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

				 experience, including customizing content for you. For example, if we see
				 other users with similar interests, we might suggest content to you that
				 you might like.</li>
