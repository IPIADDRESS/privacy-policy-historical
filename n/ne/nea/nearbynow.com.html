			<p>At NearbyNow we recognize that privacy is important. This document outlines the types 

			   of personal information we receive and collect when you use NearbyNow services and how 

			   we use that information, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard the information

			   you share. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing personal 

			   information with us.

				 most NearbyNow services, no registration is required and we do not collect

				 personal information. However, for some services (such as a "sale alert"

				 service), we may require collecting personal information that can identify

				 you, such as an e-mail, cell phone number, or other contact information. </li>

			 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

				 mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">We

				 may combine personal information collected from you with information from

				 other NearbyNow services or third parties to provide a better user

				 experience, including customizing content for you. For example, if we see

				 other users with similar interests, we might suggest content to you that

				 you might like.</li>

				 mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">NearbyNow

				 uses cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely

				 identifies your browser) and other technologies to enhance your online

				 experience and to learn about how you use NearbyNow services in order to

				 improve the quality of our services. This allows you to do things like

				 save your preferences, and make subsequent visits faster and easier.</li>

			 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

				 mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">NearbyNow's servers automatically record information when you visit our

				 mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in">We

				 may use personal information to provide the services you've requested,

				 including services that display customized content and advertising. For

				 example, if you would specify to receive e-mail alerts for "all sales on

				 women's apparel", we would send an e-mail to you to notify you of the

				 sale, and that e-mail may include a related advertisement.</li>

			 <li style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

				 mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in">We may share your personal information with our carefully selected partners, such as mall operators and merchants, who have products or services that may be of interest to you.  For example, if you have "reserved a product" at a particular merchant, we may share your personal information with that merchant so it may contact you about other products at its store.  You may opt-out of these disclosures.  </li>

			 <li style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

				 mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in">We may be required to disclose personal or other information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may use and share personal or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent potential fraud or other illegal or prohibited activity, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</li>

You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided through NearbyNow with the branding of the store or service.  We may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the other company's use of your customer information so please read the other company's privacy policy to understand how your information will be used.</li>
