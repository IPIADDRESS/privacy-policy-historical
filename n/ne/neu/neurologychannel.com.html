Attention:  Privacy (California Privacy Rights)</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><b>Personal Information MediZine Collects From You</b></font></p>
<p>
If you are receiving MediZine publications and promotional messages via postal or e-mail, this is due to your having registered to receive such messages online or to your having returned a business reply card to MediZine upon which you included certain Personal Information and indicated your interest in receiving such communications.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" shall mean information that can be used to identify you, including, but not limited to: (a) a first and last name; (b) a home or other physical address, including street name and name of city or town; (c) an e-mail address; (d) a telephone number; (e) age/birth date; or (f) personal health information.  MediZine collects Personal Information from you through online registration, business reply cards and online surveys and questionnaires that you submit. </p>
<p>
This Website makes forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users (collectively, "Additional Services"). Please remember that any information that you may post in these Additional Services becomes public information when you post it and the use thereof is not within our control.  Please exercise caution and discretion when posting Personal Information in these Additional Services.</p> 
<p>
A user may be required to submit his/her name and e-mail address to post a question in the Additional Services. This information is not used by MediZine, unless the user registers for an Additional Service, in which case the Personal Information submitted shall be retained in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Passwords are retained only when a user registers for an Additional Service.  Each Additional Service may have additional terms applicable to the use thereof ("Additional Terms") and by registering for or participating in such service, you agree to be bound by such Additional Terms.</p>
<p>

All users of the Website are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we have the right to refuse or revoke your right to use our Website and/or reject and delete any entry you make, if we have reason to believe information you provide to us is or may be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
A user may update his/her Personal Information by submitting a request via the contact information provided below in the Section entitled <b>Contacting us about privacy questions or concerns</b>.  We attempt to reply promptly to these requests and may, in our discretion, file comments submitted to improve the Website and any Additional Services, or review and discard the information. </p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><b>How MediZine Uses Personal Information</b></font></p>

<p>
MediZine may use your Personal Information to send postal and/or e-mail communications to you, including communications sent on behalf of its advertisers and other partners.  If you indicated your interest in receiving health or medical information from third parties, then MediZine may share your Personal Information with such third parties.  MediZine does not share your Personal Information with any third parties other than as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy.  MediZine may use your Personal Information for internal business purposes, such as performing market analysis and analyzing and managing its business.</p>
<p>
MediZine may provide subscriber subscriber information in aggregate, de-identified form (i.e., in a manner that the data cannot be traced back to you) to its advertisers and other parties.  MediZine at times may share Personal Information (name and physical address) with third parties for marketing and fundraising purposes.</p>
<p>
MediZine may, in its sole discretion, share or transfer your Personal Information where permitted or required by law, to comply with legal process (for example, MediZine may disclose your information as necessary to comply with an authorized civil, criminal or regulatory investigation), to protect the security or integrity of its databases or the Website, to protect MediZine's business or reputation, to take precautions against legal liability, in the event of a business transition (see below), to protect and defend the rights or property of MediZine, for required institutional risk control, or for resolving disputes, inquiries or complaints with respect to your use of the Website.</p>
<p>
MediZine may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on its behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, information technology support, maintaining and removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on MediZine's behalf shall have access to its users’ Personal Information as needed to perform their functions for MediZine but are not permitted to use your Personal Information for other purposes.  All MediZine contractors operate under federal and state laws regarding consumer privacy.</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><b>Business Transitions</b></font></p>
<p>
In the event MediZine goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information might be among the assets transferred.</p> 

<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><b>Your IP Address</b></font></p>
<p>
Each time you visit <a href="http://www.medizine.com/">www.medizine.com</a> (the "Website"), our web server automatically recognizes your IP address and the web page from which you came. Your IP address may be used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We also may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Website and to better serve you in using the Website.</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><b>Cookies and Action Tags</b></font></p>
<p>
The first time a user provides an e-mail address in connection with their activities at the Website, MediZine assigns an identification number to that e-mail address and deploys a cookie to the applicable user's PC. Whenever that user comes back to the Website using the same PC, the cookie allows the Website to identify the user and to recall the user's e-mail address. If, at any time, a user provides other information in connection with their activities on the Website (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), MediZine may store that information, along with the user's e-mail address, in its user database. MediZine may use the Personal Information stored in its database: (i) to effectuate the purpose or transaction for which the information was originally provided by a user; (ii) to pre-populate information fields in the event a user wishes to purchase products and/or services or sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or other offers in the future; (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while visiting the Website; and/or (iv) to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers, promotions or advertisements that were historically, or are likely to be, of interest to that user. MediZine also may use cookies to anonymously track and target the interests of our users to further enhance the experience on the Website. To find out more about cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.</p>

<p>Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other information on a website. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. MediZine may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our Website and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. MediZine reserves the right to retain this cookie and action tag data indefinitely. MediZine at times links the data collected through the means described in this paragraph with your Personal Information for purposes of customizing messages to you and customizing Website content for you.  At no time will MediZine share cookie-related, action-tag-related and/or generated information and/or data with third parties.</p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"><b>Security Precautions</b></font></p>
<p>

MediZine strives to protect the privacy and security of the data it collects and maintains.  MediZine (including through its contractors) maintains reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards and security measures to protect the confidentiality, loss, misuse, and alteration of your Personal Information.  MediZine keeps your Personal Information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.  We have taken certain physical, electronic, contractual and managerial steps to safeguard and secure the information we collect from Website visitors and magazine readers.

In these instances, you may be required to provide certain information, such as a credit card number, to register or complete a transaction at such website.  These third-party websites have separate privacy and data collection practices and we have no responsibility or liability relating to such policies or practices.</p>
