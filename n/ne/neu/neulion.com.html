								NeuLion.com Privacy Policy
<br><br>
NeuLion, Inc., subsidiary DivX LLC, and related entities ("Company") are committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our websites, located at www.neulion.com and www.divx.com ("Site") and Services (as defined in the Terms of Use). Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given in our Terms of Use located at http://www.neulion.com/terms-of-use.
<br><br>
1. User Consent. By submitting Personal Data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
2. A Note About Children. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Data such parent should contact us at privacy@neulion.com. If we become aware of Personal Data belonging to a child under 13, we will take reasonable steps to delete such Personal Data from our files.
<br><br>
3. A Note to Users Outside of the United States. Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
<br><br>
4. Types of Data We Collect. "Personal Data" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other nonpublic information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
<br><br>
(a) Personal Data You Provide to Us.
<br><br>

(ii) When you order Services on our Site, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information and shipping information.
<br><br>
(iii) We also retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your Account.
<br><br>
(iv) if you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail in response to an employment opportunity posted on our Site, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume.

<br><br>
(viii) We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, system configuration and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services.
<br><br>
(ix) We collect other, non-personally identifiable information using cookies, server logs, and single-pixel or transparent image HTML-based emails. The images in the HTML-based emails allow us to track how many people open the emails we send out.
<br><br>
(x) If you purchase and watch protected DivX content using the DivX Player, which is a downloadable software product owned by subsidiary DivX, LLC,  you will have to create an Account and the DivX Player application will track and log requests to view the protected content in order for us to enforce the usage rights set by the content owner. In order for your copy of the protected content to play using the DivX Player, a unique identifier will be inserted into your copy of the protected content. When you actually play the protected content using the DivX Player, no information is sent to us. Additionally, no information is collected when you watch unprotected content.
<br><br>

<br><br>
