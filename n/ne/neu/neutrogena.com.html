			<h2>Neutrogena.com Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Welcome to www.neutrogena.com. This site is owned by Neutrogena Corporation. This 
		Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding 
		collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via 
		this site and certain related services. Please be sure to read this entire 
		Privacy Policy before using, or submitting information, to this site. This 
		site is intended for use by residents of the United States. 
      
      </p><h3>Your Consent</h3>
      <p>By using this site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever 
		you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use, 
		and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
      </p>
      
      <h3>About Children</h3>
      <p>This site is not intended for children under the age of 13. We will not 
		knowingly collect information from site visitors in this age group. We 
		encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the 
		Internet and the information they disclose to Web sites. 
		</p>
      <h3>Active Information Collection</h3>
      <p>Like many Web sites, this site actively collects information from its visitors 
	      both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate 
		directly with us via e-mail, feedback forms, and/or chat rooms. Some of 
		the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information 
		(that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as 
		your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and so on). 
      </p>
      <p>Some areas of this site may require you to submit information in order for you 
		to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, 
		tips/pointers, order processing) or to participate in a particular 
		activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions). You will be informed 
		at each information collection point what information is required and what 
		information is optional.</p>
      <p>When you submit information for a specific feature or particular activity you 
		are given the opportunity to request email (opt-in) from the site.
		It is not the policy of this site to send unsolicited email.
		This site may rent permission based opt-in lists for the purpose of 
		promotion. You will be notified as to the source of the list at the time of the mailing.
		If you no longer wish to receive email from this site you can simply click on the unsubscribe link at the 
		bottom of the email or send an email to <b><a href="mailto:ntgweb@neuus.jnj.com">ntgweb@neuus.jnj.com</a></b>
		requesting to be unsubscribed.</p>
      
      <h3>Passive Information Collection</h3>
      <p>As you navigate through a Web site, certain information can be passively 
      collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the 
      information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet 
      Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data 
      collection.</p>
      <p>This site may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number 
      assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can 
      access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally 
      identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic 
      (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static 
      (unique to a particular user's computer). We use your IP address to 
      diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine 
      the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and 
      administer and improve the site.</p>
      <p>A "cookie" is a bit of information that a Web site sends to your Web browser 
      that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences. 
	  </p>
      <p>"Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit 
      your Web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session 
      cookies are used to improve navigation on Web sites and to collect 
      aggregate statistical information. This site uses session cookies. 
      </p>
      <p>"Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 
      1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the Web site server 
      information such as the IP address and browser type related to the 
      visitor's computer. We may use internet tags at this site and in email messages sent through a 
      third party email service provider.
      </p><p>"Navigational data" ("log files," "server logs," and "clickstream" data) are used for 
      system management, to improve the content of the site, market research 
      purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. This site uses 
      navigational data.</p>
      <p>A "Redirect Tag" is a Web page tag that can be used to determine if a visitor has clicked 
      through a specific link in a Web page. Redirect tags can be placed in 
      online advertisements, in HTML email messages, and on different pages of 
      the site. We may use redirect tags at this site and in email messages sent through a third party email 
      service provider.
      
      </p><h3>Use and Disclosure of Information</h3>
      <p>Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the content of 
      our site, to customize the site to your preferences, to communicate 
      information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and 
      research purposes, and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. 
      </p>
      <p>If you provide personally identifiable information to this site, we may 
      combine such information with other actively collected information unless 
      we specify otherwise at the point of collection. We will take reasonable 
      measures to prevent personally identifiable information from being 
      combined with passively collected information, unless you consent 
      otherwise.</p>
      <p>We may disclose your personally identifiable information to other Johnson 
      &amp; Johnson affiliates worldwide that agree to treat it in accordance 
      with this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may disclose your personally 
      identifiable information to third parties, located in the United States 
      and/or any other country, but only</p>
      
      <blockquote>
      <p>(i) to contractors we use to support our business (e.g., fulfillment services, 
      technical support, delivery services, and financial institutions), in 
      which case we will require such third parties to agree to treat it in 
      accordance with this Privacy Policy;</p>
      
      <p>(ii) in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business 
      of this site to which the information relates, in which case we will 
      require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this 
      Privacy Policy; or</p>
      
	  <p>(iii) where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government 
      regulations. In addition, we will make full use of all information 
      acquired through this site that is not in personally identifiable form. 
      </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Remember that the information provided by this site is for general background 
      purposes and is not intended to be used in connection with, or as a 
      substitute for, medical diagnosis or treatment by a trained professional. 
      You should always consult your own physician about any healthcare 
      questions you may have, especially before trying a new medication, diet, 
      fitness program, or approach to health care issues.</p>
      
      <h3>Access and Correction</h3>
      <p>To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current, and 
      complete, please contact us as specified below. We will take reasonable 
      steps to update or correct personally identifiable information in our 
      possession that you have previously submitted via this site. 
	  </p>
      
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information 
      as you transmit your information from your computer to our site and to 
      protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, 
      disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no 
      Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, 
      e-mail sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should 
      therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us 
      via e-mail. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other 
      special access features on this site, it is your responsibility to 
      safeguard them.</p>

      <p>This site may contain links or references to other Web sites. Please be aware 
      that we do not control other Web sites and that, in any case, this Privacy 
      Policy does not apply to those Web sites. We encourage you to read the 
      privacy policy of every Web site you visit.</p>
